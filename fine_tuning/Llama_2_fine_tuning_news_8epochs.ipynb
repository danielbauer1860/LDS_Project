This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting. Give your apologies as you walk in   Well yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if  You know these, these , V P's V P's, yeah. sits down and says . So this time I was determined not to erm, get caught. And it's paid off. It was a, a nice place. Nice and sunny. Ba , I had  Yeah. lunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till  till quarter to two  erm  and then went back inside. But you, you sat outside for the best part of  quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, cos it was so sunny. And it was a  When the weather's nice it's just lovely, really nice  Oh it's beautiful! Yes. It's just  and it's so, it's like it was raining the other day when we went to go out  and just could not be bothered. It was really  Mm. pelting down. Oh it was when we were gonna go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no, I really cannot be bothered, it's just pouring down with rain, had to  Yeah. get the bus and I thought, oh er  so luckily Lisa sa , like they said, oh don't be silly we'll come and get you. So luckily, they like drove round and picked me up  Oh I see. and just brought me back again, which is fine. Right. But , just when you've got no transport and it's  Mm mm. pouring down with rain it's  it's just such an effort  to motivate yourself to get up to  Oh God! Yeah. It's like when we had no wa , like heating  or water, it was such an effort to  get yourself up  Yeah. to get ready to go out and the  Yeah. just, cold showers and stuff are like Oh bloody hell! not on my list of like  pleasurable er  No. things to do. Just like, no way! No I  I mean,we , I say, we sat out there and the peacocks are there  peahens. Oh yeah! Oh really? Mm mm. I see. I say, it i , it's nice, I mean, unless you  you really know about it  you have no idea at all. No. No idea. I suppose a lot of business might be done through word of mouth as well. Mm mm. If anything. The kind of thing you ought to do with  with mum is like, you could probably go down one Sunday and have a, have a, you know, have a lunch. It'll be Yeah. visit   It's not that far is it? Well it took us, as I say, an hour and a quarter. Pick me up on the way. Ha, ha, ha! Joke! I see , so we go round the M    twenty five, up to the M four    yes! Yes. Any minor detour. Any minor detour. There'll be convenient roadworks at Twickenham. I see.

I mean he died of, cancer, cancer of the lung, cancer of the lung, yes. Oh I didn't realize it was that. Oh I see. Mm. I didn't realize it was from smoking. And they said that er  yo , you're  you'll be war , the signs would  then, in fact, that er  there was a link up  Mm. with that. And until that I didn't reali  Oh I didn't realize he died cos  I, I, I, carried on smoking for a number of years after that. Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm. But basically that's because of  Well yes, the  his family, you know  family, yeah sure. Sure that's always outlet. sort of understand, yeah, something you've, you know, why he does it. Which is really sad. He's a really sweet guy . But erm Just thinks too much and smokes too much. Well  well I do , I heard it over the weekend in fact, that I can er, have er, another  BUPA medical to start with. Really? Er, yeah. At the place just not far  away from er, where I work. Oh that's quite good. So I , I mean, I've got to go in for that. Did you, what, do you have to pay for it? No, the bank pays. I see. Oh that's really good.

I suppose they must put these in the  the oven I would  Yeah. think, is er right? They have loads of them. Put them on most of the tables I think. Probably save them loads of money as well. Oh well.

Well it's a  It came at the right time. E each of them  approved. Yeah. Am I still covered under BUPA? I think so. Erm, I, I wa , when I get into work on Monday I'll have to find out. I'm not ill or anything  so don't worry at the moment . Er, but I , I, I, I think  erm  I think had it out up until Robert is baby. He, he's joined his own wo , he's joined his own. He joined his own, but I mean when he was at college. Yeah. I think he said he was covered actually. Well I don't know. Well I'll find out  so, at least then  er, if there is, you know, you're  Yeah. aware of, of what  Yeah. one can do. Well, it's, it's very, very handy actually. Oh sure. It's a very good thing  That's right. if you've got  the money, sort of, the means to do it Well I think  then do. the bank pays and it  Yeah. comes out from  from  Ye  from my tax. Yeah. I do , I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health  in this kind, but to  know that you're covered rather  Yeah. than er Oh yeah. er ha , have problems  er er er, er when, when you  Definitely  require something. It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm. Much quicker though. .Not very big actually is it? Big restaurant. No. I would have thought it would have ex extended by the door  No I don't think it does. but it doesn't. It's the Ah perhaps to the toilet. There's loads er like, in the window  when we, like  newspaper articles and  things where it's been recommended and stuff. Ah I see.

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

I take it we're leaving pretty quickly? No I, I had a feeling that I was gonna get landed with the bill there. Dear oh dear! It's the reason you came to see me. I thought it was a matter of going Dutch. I dunno. That's only on dates, you're my father. Is , oh oh. You  That doesn't count. Well let's see if I've got any money. My God! I think I paid it in. Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is therefore inevitable that some kind of singularity will occur on the hypersurface f + g = 0. It can also be seen from (6.17), that this is the hypersurface on which the two opposing waves mutually focus each other, as the contraction of each wave here becomes unbounded. This was anticipated by the discussion in Section 5.3. It is now appropriate to consider whether the caustics formed in this way correspond to mere coordinate singularities, or whether they are necessarily curvature singularities as they are in the Khan-Penrose solution. It has also been pointed out previously that coordinate singularities necessarily occur in the regions II and III that contain the approaching waves. The character and significance of these singularities must also be considered in this chapter. 8.1 Singularities According to the general theory of relativity, space-time is represented by a connected C \\u221e Hausdorff manifold M together with a locally Lorentz metric g . A singularity in the space-time is indicated by incomplete geodesics or incomplete curves of bounded acceleration (Hawking and Ellis, 1973). By definition, space-time is smooth and does not contain any irregular points. It follows that a singularity may normally be considered as occurring only at a boundary of space-time. Unfortunately, no single definition of a singularity has yet been found which is applicable to all situations. One of the more useful ways of attaching a boundary to a singular space-time is by a b (bundle) -boundary construction. The b -boundary  is the projection into a space-time of a natural boundary attached to a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In the standard b -boundary construction, the Riemannian manifold is the bundle of frames over space-time having a positive definite metric induced by the affine connection. Boundary points of the frame bundle are determined by giving end points to all Cauchy sequences which do not converge in the frame bundle. The bundle boundary is then projected down to make a boundary for the space-time. According to the classification scheme devised by Ellis and Schmidt (1977), singularities in maximal, four-dimensional space-times can be divided into three basic types: quasiregular, non-scalar curvature and scalar curvature. This scheme describes the singularity structure of a space-time  on which the Riemann tensor is C k  . It uses a b -boundary construction to determine the location of singular points. If the b -boundary is non-empty, there are only two possibilities. Either a point q in the b -boundary may be a  regular boundary point if the space-time  can be embedded in a larger space-time  such that the Riemann tensor is C r and q is an interior point in , or it may be a  singular boundary point if the space-time  is not extendable through q in a  way. A singular boundary point q can then be classified according to this scheme. It may be a C k  (or C k-  )quasiregular singularity if all components of the Riemann tensor and its first k derivatives evaluated in an orthonormal frame parallel propagated along an incomplete geodesic ending at q are C (or C 0- ). Such frames are called PPON frames. It may alternatively be a C k  (or C k-  ) curvature singularity if this is not true. In this case it may either be categorized as a C k  (or C k-  )non-scalar curvature singularity if all scalars in the metric tensor , the alternating symbol , the Riemann tensor and its first k derivatives are bounded, that is, tend to a C (or C -) function. Alternatively, it may be a C k  (or C k-  )scalar curvature singularity or a scalar polynomial curvature singularity if some scalar does not tend to a C (or C -) function. The most familiar class of singularities are the scalar curvature singularities. These include the \\u2018big bang\\u2019 and \\u2018black hole\\u2019types of singularity which closely correspond to one's intuitive concept of a real physical singularity. As such a singularity is approached, some physical quantities diverge and all observers feel unbounded tidal forces. The non-scalar curvature and quasiregular singularities are much less well understood and have been less fully investigated. Consider, for example, a space-time with a non-scalar curvature singularity. No curvature scalars diverge in this case, yet some components of the Riemann tensor evaluated in a PPON frame along an incomplete curve do not tend to  finite limits as the singularity is approached. The physical effect of this is that all test particles which fall into the non-scalar curvature singularity feel infinite tidal forces, but observers can move arbitrarily close to the singularity on other curves and feel no untoward effects. Finally, consider a space-time with a quasiregular singularity. In all reasonable frames the Riemann tensor is completely finite. In this case, observers near a quasiregular singularity, including those who fall into the singularity itself, do not feel unbounded tidal forces. All three types of singularity are found in colliding plane wave solutions. In the following sections and chapters the singularity and global structure of particular solutions will be analysed in more detail. The singularity in region IV In the exact solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) described in Chapter 3, there is a scalar curvature singularity in region IV on the hypersurface . However, it is not clear whether or not this type of singularity will occur in other solutions, particularly as the Khan-Penrose solution contains impulsive gravitational waves. This question has been considered by Szekeres (1972), who found that, for colliding gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization, a curvature singularity is inevitable. This work was generalized by Sbytov (1976) to plane gravitational waves with arbitrary polarization, with the same result. However, more recently, counterexamples to these conclusions have been obtained, in the non-aligned case by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986c), and in the aligned case by a degenerate solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987b) and by the algebraically general solutions of Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez (1989). In these cases, the curvature scalars remain bounded on the hypersurface , and scalar polynomial curvature singularities occur in the extensions of the solution through the focusing singularity. These exceptional cases will be considered in detail later on. For the present, it may simply be observed that Szekeres and Sbytov had omitted to include these cases. Another counterexample proposed by Stoyanov (1979) has proved to be incorrect as it does not satisfy the required boundary conditions (see Section 10.2). The same question applied to colliding electromagnetic waves is more complicated, and the answers are less conclusive. Generally, one may expect that, for a combination of gravitational and electromagnetic waves, a curvature singularity in region IV will usually occur. However, for purely electromagnetic waves it is less clear. In the first exact solution of this  type, given by Bell and Szekeres (1974), the singularity on the hypersurface  was shown to be only a coordinate singularity that could easily be removed by a coordinate transformation. This solution, which is conformally flat in the interaction region, will be described in Chapter 14 together with the full analysis of its singularity structure as given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). Other type D electrovac solutions have been obtained by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987a) and Papacostas and Xanthopoulos (1988). Further algebraically general solutions without curvature singularities can easily be constructed as will be indicated in Section 17.2. All these have quasiregular singularities that are interpreted as Cauchy horizons on the surface . These will be described later. We may conclude that, in all cases, the opposing waves mutually focus each other onto the hypersurface , on which the contraction of the waves is unbounded and the line element (6.20) is singular. Usually this will be a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, but a large class of  significant exceptions occurs. It is convenient to point out at this stage that, for colliding gravitational and electromagnetic waves, two of the scalar polynomial invariants (Penrose and Rindler, 1986) are given by  (8.2) It follows from this that, in order to prove the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, it is sufficient merely to show that the component 2 is unbounded. In this case either I or J must be unbounded, and a curvature singularity occurs. It would, of course, be useful to have a number of general theorems that could be used to determine the singularity structure of particular classes of solutions. Apart from the earlier results of Szekeres (1972) and Sbytov (1976), the only general theorem to date is that of Tipler (1980). This is in fact a straightforward generalization of a theorem of Penrose (1965b)(see also Hawking and Ellis 1973, p.263). Quoting it directly: Theorem 8.1 (Tipler)Let (M, g) be a space-time with g at least C 2 , and suppose (M, g) has two globally defined commuting space-like Killing vector fields \\u03b4 x  and \\u03b4 y  which together generate plane symmetry. If,(1) the null convergence condition holds;(2) at least one of the six quantities  is non-zero at some point p in (M, g); and (3) through the point p there is a space-like partial Cauchy surface S, which is everywhere tangent to \\u03b4 x  and \\u03b4 y , and S is non-compact in the space-like direction normal to \\u03b4 x  and \\u03b4 y ; then (M, g) is null incomplete. This is an interesting theorem which seems to prove the existence of singularities for a large class of colliding plane waves. However, it requires that the metric be at least C 2 everywhere. It thus excludes situations involving impulsive gravitational waves. It does not apply therefore to the solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971), Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ), and the exceptional solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ). Nor does it apply to the colliding electromagnetic wave solution of Bell and Szekeres (1974) in which impulsive gravitational waves are generated by the collision. In addition, it proves only geodesic incompleteness and says nothing about curvature singularities. There exists, however, a very large class of exceptional solutions in which curvature singularities do not occur. For gravitational waves these include a degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez (1987b) solution and the solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986b), which are respectively parts of the Schwarzschild and Kerr space-times. These have been described in more detail by Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1988), and will be described in Sections 10.5 and 13.3. They contain impulsive wave components, and therefore do not satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem. In all these solutions, the singularity that occurs when  corresponds to a Cauchy horizon. This may be followed by either a space-like, or a time-like curvature singularity. The latter case would indicate that, if it were possible for real observers to pass through the horizon, then most would miss this singularity. A further class of exceptional vacuum solutions in which the curvature singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon has been obtained by Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez (1989). These solutions contain a subclass in which the approaching waves have smooth wave fronts and the metric is everywhere at least C 2 . They thus satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem. They are geodesically incomplete, but the focusing hypersurface in this case is only a quasiregular singularity. These solutions thus illustrate the fact that a proof of null incompleteness does not necessarily imply the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity. The Killing-Cauchy horizons that occur in these solutions have particular significance as the caustics formed by the mutual  focusing of the opposing waves. They have also been further investigated by Yurtsever (1987), who has shown that they are unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the existence of space-like singularities is likely to be a generic feature of colliding plane wave solutions. This conclusion is also supported by the work of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987 b ), who have shown that the presence of an arbitrarily small amount of dust will change a horizon into a curvature singularity. In these exceptional cases, it is necessary for the approaching waves to take very specific forms in order to achieve the appropriate solution in region IV. The instability of the horizons in these solutions can easily be demonstrated in that they require very specific forms for the initial functions f(u) and g(v) . Any slight variation in these functions would change the Cauchy horizon into a curvature singularity. Most of the exceptional solutions that have been explicitly obtained are of algebraic type D, although the solutions of Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez are algebraically general. Perhaps it should also be remarked that algebraic type D solutions do not necessarily have horizons rather than singularities, a counterexample being one of the degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ) solutions. An alternative proof of Tipler's Theorem 8.1 has been given by Yurtsever (1988 b ). This emphasizes the role and necessity of the assumption of a strict plane symmetry. In this approach, the exceptional solutions that have Killing-Cauchy horizons in the interaction region do not satisfy the condition of strict plane symmetry as defined by Yurtsever. The structure of the singularity in the interaction region has been further analysed by Yurtsever (1988 c , 1989 a ), who has shown that the metric is asymptotic to an inhomogeneous Kasner solution as the singularity is approached. Initially (Yurtsever 1988 c ), he considered the case when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization and obtained explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data posed along the wave fronts of the approaching waves. From these expressions it is clear that, for specific choices of initial data, the curvature singularity formed by the interacting waves degenerates to a coordinate singularity. It can also be concluded that these Killing-Cauchy horizons are unstable against small but generic perturbations of the initial data and that, in a very precise sense, \\u2018generic\\u2019 initial data always produce all-embracing space-like curvature singularities. In the subsequent paper (Yurtsever, 1989 a ), he has shown that these same conclusions are also reached in the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is arbitrary. The Khan-Penrose solution The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) which has already been discussed in detail in Chapter 3, may now be reconsidered. It was shown there in particular, that the scalar invariants are unbounded on the hypersurface  in region IV, where  and . This clearly demonstrates the existence of a scalar curvature singularity on this hypersurface. In addition to this, there are apparent coordinate singularities  extending from it into regions II and III. The naive singularity structure of this solution is thus as represented in Figure 3.2. It is now necessary to consider in more detail the character of the apparent singularities in these initial regions II and III. As described in Section 3.3, if it is possible for real particles to pass through them, then it will be possible for those particles to subsequently look back and observe the naked singularity in region IV. If correct, this would provide a counterexample to the cosmic censorship hypothesis. It is more likely, however, that these singularities will prove to be more than artificial coordinate singularities that particles can pass through. Figure 8.1 Sections through surfaces v = constant,y = 0, when u = 0, for three different (negative) values of v . Figure 8.2 Sections through the surface v = constant,y = 0, for three different values of u . This question has been discussed in an interesting paper by Matzner and Tipler (1984). Because of the obvious symmetry, we may concentrate on the singularity in region II. The first point to note is that, since the initial waves are impulsive, the interiors of both regions I and II are flat. For , curvature only occurs on the null boundary . The line elements for regions I and II are respectively  (8.3). (8.4) That these both describe flat space-time can be demonstrated by transforming (8.4) to the form (8.3) by putting . (8.5) It may be observed that the coordinate singularity  is effectively removed by this transformation, and there appears no a priori reason preventing the continuation of the coordinates  through it. Figure 8.3 Surfaces v = constant,y = 0,, for different (negative) values of v . Notice that the line  is common to all surfaces. Matzner and Tipler proceed to investigate the properties of the null hypersurfaces v = constant, working with the null Minkowski coordinates . Projections of these hypersurfaces are illustrated in Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. It can be seen that as  the curvature of these hypersurfaces diverges. It should also be noticed that the surfaces v = constant, considered as embedded in the three-space , consist of nested two-surfaces all having the line  in common. It is then possible show that the hypersurface  is not merely a coordinate singularity, but is actually a singularity of space-time in the sense that there does not exist a C 1 extension from region II to this surface. This can not be a curvature singularity, since the curvature tensor on it is zero. Matzner and Tipler accordingly describe it as a \\u2018fold singularity\\u2019. With this interpretation, the structure of the Khan-Penrose solution is thus as described in Figure 8.4. This result raises another problem. In the absence of the second wave, the entire space-time may be described by (8.3) for , and by (8.4) for , for all values of v . In this case, is merely a coordinate singularity. It has no physical significance and can be removed by a coordinate transformation. However, once the second wave is present, with wavefront , the above result states that  becomes a space-time singularity even for . This seems to violate our familiar concept of causality. The presence of the second wave seems to change the character of the prior singularity. Figure 8.4 The singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution. The resolution of this problem can be demonstrated using Figure 8.3. The family of surfaces for v = constant can be continued up to. However, there is a curvature singularity at . The final surface , which forms a bound for the prior surfaces, therefore contains a singularity on the line . In fact, this line  is actually common to the entire family of surfaces for which . Thus the line  must be considered as a singularity of space-time, which is identified with the point . In the Khan-Penrose solution, the singularities in regions II and III are topological singularities that are identified with the curvature singularity in region IV by the particular choice of coordinates. This point may be further clarified by considering a family of null geodesics that are initially parallel in region I, and enter region II. The null geodesic ,v = constant, starts in region I, passes through the gravitational wave and apparently ends at the  singularity. This may be contrasted, however, with a neighbouring geodesic which is given using  the null Minkowski coordinates defined by (8.5), by . This geodesic is given by . (8.6) From this it is clear that v increases indefinitely as  even for arbitrarily small values of \\u03b5. Thus, although the geodesic with   approaches the \\u2018fold singularity\\u2019 apparently at a finite distance from the curvature singularity in region IV, an arbitrarily close geodesic that is initially parallel to it in region II diverges from it and crosses into region IV before it reaches the hypersurface . This geodesic subsequently terminates in the curvature singularity in region IV. The projection of these two geodesics onto the plane  is illustrated in Figure 8.5. Figure 8.5 Projections of two neighbouring null geodesics onto the plane . The geodesics are parallel and arbitrarily close in region II, which is flat. It has thus been argued that the singularities  and  in regions II and III are essentially extensions of the singularity  in region IV. The apparent non-causality that appears in the introduction of these singularities is a consequence of the projection of the space-time onto the plane . Such a projection does not in general preserve causal relations. Although Figure 8.4 is very useful in formulating the colliding plane wave problem by dividing the space-time up into appropriate regions, in many ways it is misleading. In particular, it does not adequately describe the singularity structure of the solution, which appears to be non-causal. The problem arises from the attempt to represent space-time on a two-dimensional diagram. In many ways it would be preferable to attempt to picture a three-dimensional structure as in Figure 8.3. Such a picture has been drawn by Penrose, and was included in the paper of Matzner and Tipler (1984). This structure is illustrated in Figure 8.6 where the four regions are separately represented. Since curvature occurs only on the boundaries of regions I, II and III, the differently shaped boundaries of these regions have to be identified artificially. Region IV is curved and no adequate representation of it can be given. Using the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977), it can be seen that the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution is  clearly a scalar polynomial curvature singularity. Also the fold singularities in regions II and III that have a topological character, are quasiregular singularities since on them the curvature tensor is zero. Figure 8.6 A three-dimensional picture of the Khan-Penrose solution with . The interiors of regions I, II and III are flat, but the boundaries have intrinsically different geometry. Points on opposite sides of the wavefronts  and  must be identified. Region IV is curved, so its representation should be considered no more than schematic. The structure of other solutions In the previous section the singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution has been analysed in some detail. This has been possible because the interiors of regions I, II and III are all flat. In the general problem, however, it is only the background region I that is taken to be flat, and regions II and III, as well as IV, are curved. Consequently it is not possible in general to analyse the singularity structure in such detail. It is reasonable to assume, however, that most colliding plane wave solutions will have the same general singularity structure as that of the Khan Penrose solution. This in fact turns out to be the case, as will be shown here and in the following chapters. In almost all cases a curvature singularity develops in region IV on the hypersurface , although there is a large class of exceptional solutions in which the singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon. These exceptional solutions provide the  only significant variation of the general singularity structure described above. The structure of these solutions will be described as they are derived in the following chapters. It has also been shown that, for all colliding plane wave solutions, coordinate singularities necessarily occur in regions II and III. For vacuum solutions, in these regions at most one component, either 4 or 0, of the curvature tensor is non-zero. Scalar polynomial curvature singularities therefore cannot occur. The coordinate singularities on the hypersurfaces  and  may thus either be quasiregular singularities if the curvature tensor on these surfaces is bounded, or they must be non-scalar curvature singularities if the curvature components become unbounded. It will now be argued that the topological \\u2018fold\\u2019 singularities of regions II and III in the Khan-Penrose solution, are also general features of all colliding plane wave solutions. Figure 8.7 The singularity structure for colliding sandwich gravitational waves. The shaded regions have non-zero curvature. If the approaching waves are \\u2018sandwich\\u2019 gravitational waves, then the regions behind the waves are flat. These flat regions must be described by metrics that are equivalent to those of the Khan-Penrose solution for regions II and III. After all, the impulsive waves considered by Khan and Penrose may be regarded as idealizations of such waves. In these cases similar \\u2018fold\\u2019 singularities will occur, as described in Figure 8.7. These singularities in regions II and III have been more thoroughly investigated by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989). By concentrating on the Szekeres (1972) family of solutions, they have shown that these are quasiregular singularities in the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977) in the cases of impulsive and sandwich waves. In the alternative case of thick gravitational waves, they are non-scalar curvature singularities. In addition, by considering scalar wave perturbations in the impulsive  wave case, they have also shown that the quasiregular singularities are unstable and convert to scalar curvature singularities. To consider further the general character of these coordinate singularities in regions II and III we may concentrate on region II. The metric in this region may be taken to be of the form (6.20), but with the metric functions U ,V ,W and M all depending on u only. These functions may be obtained from those in region I simply by replacing g by \\u00bd, or v by 0. Considering the geodesics in this region, it is clear that there exist three conserved momentum components p x  ,p y  and p v  besides the energy integral. These are given by  (8.7) where \\u03b5 may be taken to be 0 on null geodesics and 1 on time-like geodesics. Using (8.7), we obtain the equation  (8.8) Expressions for U and M in region II can be obtained from (7.2) and (7.8) in the form  (8.9) With these,(8.8) may be integrated to give  (8.10) It may immediately be seen from this that no time-like or null geodesics with either p x  or p y  non-zero can avoid crossing the surface  into  region IV before reaching the surface on which . The only exception occurs when . This clearly manifests the character of the fold singularity as described in the previous section. In colliding plane wave problems, what is essentially a coordinate singularity for a single wave is transformed into a fold singularity prior to the collision by the presence of curvature singularities at the points  and . Generally these are associated with a space-like singularity on , but as described above, there are exceptional cases in which this singularity is replaced by a horizon. However, even in these cases, it is found that there exist at least distribution valued singularities just at these points. From this, it may be argued that the presence of fold singularities in regions II and III appears to be a general feature of colliding plane wave problems. It has thus been argued that the general structure of all colliding plane wave solutions is as illustrated in Figure 8.6 with  with the possible exception that, for some solutions, the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon. Figure 8.8 The general structure of colliding plane wave solutions related to the initial hypersurface on which initial Cauchy data is set. It is also appropriate to attempt to relate this general singularity structure to some initial hypersurface on which the initial Cauchy data for the colliding wave problem is specified. To do this it is necessary to incorporate the properties of plane waves that have been described in Section 4.4 and illustrated in Figure 4.1. In particular, it must be noted that no global space-like hypersurface exists on which initial Cauchy data for the problem can be set. The existence of the topological \\u2018fold\\u2019 singularities in regions II and III implies bounds for the initial Cauchy  hypersurface in both of the directions from which the waves emerge. This property is illustrated in Figure 8.8. It can immediately be deduced from Figure 8.8 that, for solutions in which the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon, any possible extension through this horizon must be non-unique. Any extended space-time beyond this singularity will depend on extra initial data in addition to that specified on the initial Cauchy hypersurface for the colliding wave problem. The above arguments lead to the conclusion that the usual initial data for colliding plane waves leads to a unique solution only up to the topological singularities  and  in regions II and III, and to the \\u2018focusing\\u2019 singularity  in the interaction region. This focusing singularity is normally a curvature singularity, but this may be replaced by a Cauchy horizon. In this case, any future extension through the horizon is non-unique. THE SZEKERES CLASS OF VACUUM SOLUTIONS The first exact solution to be published which describes a collision between plane waves was in fact that of Szekeres (1970). This describes the collision of plane gravitational waves with step wavefronts. The solution discussed in Chapter 3, which describes the collision between impulsive gravitational waves, was published a little later by Khan and Penrose (1971). Following this, a substantial paper in which the subject is analysed in detail was produced by Szekeres (1972). This paper includes a derivation of the field equations in the form given in Chapter 6, a general class of exact solutions which includes the two mentioned above as special cases, and a discussion of the singularities that arise. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the properties of this general class of solutions. The solution in region IV The vacuum field equations appropriate to region IV of the colliding plane wave problem may be taken here in the form of equations (6.22a-f). These are second order differential equations for the four metric functions . Equation (6.22a) may immediately be integrated as in (6.24) to give  (9.1) where  and  are arbitrary decreasing functions which, according to the appropriate boundary conditions (7.3), are required to satisfy  and . In the Szekeres class of solutions, the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization. In these solutions therefore  (9.2) and the main equations (6.22d, e) reduce to the single equation  (9.3) For this, Szekeres has obtained the solution  (9.4) which contains two arbitrary constants k 1 and k 2 . The expression (9.4) may also be written in the alternative form  (9.5) With this expression for V , the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (9.6) where c is a constant. As anticipated in the discussion in Section 7.2, it may be observed that this expression contains the necessary multiples of  and  that are required to cancel the effects of the unbounded term on the boundary. If the leading terms in the expansions for f and g are  (9.7) where , then e -M  is continuous across the boundaries if ,(9.8) It may thus be observed that the constants k 1 and k 2 are restricted to the range satisfying  (9.9) It is also appropriate to choose  (9.10) to achieve the usual flat metric (3.6) in region I. When evaluating the components of the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to introduce the new function  (9.11) With this, it can be seen that  (9.12) and the non-zero Weyl tensor components are . (9.13) In his paper, Szekeres chooses  and  (9.14) exactly. In this case, the terms  and  in (9.6) exactly cancel the term , and M is given by  (9.15) This form is still completely general since it has, in effect, simply used the coordinate freedom (6.7). However, it is sometimes convenient to retain this freedom, so this restriction will not be made in the following section. It may now be pointed out that, with the restriction (9.14), the above solution includes the Khan-Penrose (1971) solution for colliding impulsive waves when . It also includes the Szekeres (1970) solution for colliding step waves when . The approaching waves Having obtained an exact solution in region IV, the question now is to find the initial conditions which give rise to it. In fact, it is quite simple to use the method described in Section 7.2 to extend any solution in region IV back into regions II, III and I. We obtain the corresponding solutions in regions II and III simply by replacing g by \\u00bd and f by \\u00bd alternately. In this section we will concentrate on region II, and put . The equivalent solution in region III can be obtained from this by replacing f by g , and by interchanging u and v . Using the suggested method, it can be seen that the solution in region II must have the line element  (9.16) where, retaining the coordinate freedom in u ,(9.17) In order to interpret this solution as a plane wave, it is appropriate to transform the metric to the Brinkmann form  (9.18) by putting  (9.19) The wave profile in equation (9.18) now takes either of the forms  (9.20) or  (9.21) Particular cases in which  and  are illustrated in Figure 9.1 for . Figure 9. l Some wave profiles for the approaching waves in the Szekeres solution with . The wavefront is unbounded if . It contains a step if , and is smooth if . All profiles become unbounded as u approaches 1. It may be recalled from (4.5) that . Thus, it can be clearly seen that the approaching gravitational wave in region II is an impulsive wave if , has an unbounded wavefront if , has a step wavefront if , has a continuous wavefront if , and has a smooth wavefront if . It may also be observed that, if , is monotonically increasing. The singularity structure In this family of solutions, there is always a scalar polynomial curvature singularity in region IV on the surface on which . This can be seen by computing the scalar invariant given here by  (9.22) Using (9.6) and (9.13), I can be seen to be unbounded when  for all values of k 1 and k 2 in the required range (9.9). This is similar to the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution which, of course, it includes as a special case. Another singularity occurs in cases in which a wave with an unbounded wave front moves in a region where the opposing wave is non-zero. For example, if  and  so that then I is unbounded on the boundary  between regions III and IV. Similarly, the boundary  is singular if  and  so that Apart from cases containing impulsive waves, where  or , the boundaries of region IV are therefore only regular if  for , which implies the further restriction  on (9.9). These singularities, however, are distribution-valued and their physical significance requires further investigation. The coordinate singularities in regions II and III, however, are not so obviously similar to the fold singularities of the Khan-Penrose solution. The Szekeres solutions are only flat behind the wave front in the special case when . In the general case, regions II and III are curved and the analysis given in Section 8.2 cannot be applied. However, we may notice that in all cases with , 4 becomes unbounded as  in region II. This clearly indicates that, in these cases, the singularity in this region is a non-scalar curvature singularity. This has been confirmed in rigorous calculations by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989). It has also been argued in the previous chapter that these singularities have similar properties to the fold singularities that occur for colliding impulsive waves as described in Section 8.2 in terms of the behaviour of neighbouring geodesics. A similar non-scalar curvature singularity also occurs in region III if , as  then becomes unbounded as . OTHER VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH ALIGNED POLARIZATION The solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971) and of Szekeres (1970, 1972), discussed in Chapters 3 (and Section 8.2) and 9, describe the collision of plane gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization. It is convenient to consider separately in this chapter a number of other exact solutions that satisfy this same condition. A general method In situations in which the approaching waves are linearly polarized, and their polarization vectors are aligned, it is possible to put  globally. In this case the line element (6.20), and the field equations (6.22a-f) take a particularly simple form. Equation (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give (6.24) and there is only one main equation, namely (9.3), which is a linear equation in V . For any given solution of this equation, a function M can always be found satisfying the remaining equations (6.22b, c, f), although such a function may not satisfy the required boundary conditions. The integral (6.24) involves two continuous functions  and  that are monotonically decreasing for positive arguments. As suggested by Szekeres (1972), it is therefore possible to use these as coordinates in region IV, although care has to be taken at the boundaries and it is not possible to extend these coordinates into the prior regions II and III. Using (7.8), the line element in the interaction region can thus be written in the form  (10.1) and the main equation (9.3) becomes . (10.2) which is the well-known Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. For any particular solution of (10.2), the new function S can be found by integrating equations (7.9), which now become  (10.3) In order for any particular solution to be appropriate to describe colliding plane waves, the function S must satisfy the conditions described in equations (7.10) to (7.13). Using this notation, the components of the Weyl tensor are given by the expressions  (10.4) It can thus be seen that, although (10.2) is linear so that different solutions for V can be superposed, the associated gravitational waves cannot be simply superposed. In addition, the scale factors A and B satisfying (6.13) and (6.14) must contain components of S , and from (10.3) it can be seen that these components are also non-linear in V . Once a solution of (10.2) and (10.3) describing the interaction region IV is obtained, the approaching waves in regions II and III can immediately be deduced. For example, in region II, we simply put  and assume that f takes the form . Then, removing the constant from S , it is convenient to put  (10.5) and the approaching wave is then given by  (10.6) The approaching wave in region III is obtained in exactly the same way in terms of the function . In order to obtain exact solutions, the first step is to obtain a general class of solutions of (10.2). Szekeres (1972) has indicated how to integrate  this equation using Riemann's method, and has given a general solution expressed as a line integral involving a Legendre function of order -\\u00bd. This will be described in Chapter 14. However, because it is very difficult in practice to evaluate the integrals which this method involves, this does not turn out to be a convenient method for obtaining explicit solutions. As an alternative approach, it may be observed that attempting to solve equation (10.2) by separating the variables leads to the solution  (10.7) where A and J are arbitrary constants. Thus a general class of solutions can be obtained by considering  (10.8) for arbitrary sequences of constants \\u03c3sub i  and A i  . The particular decomposition (10.8), however, does not turn out to be particularly convenient in the construction of explicit solutions. We will therefore proceed by changing the coordinates. Before introducing a new set of coordinates, it may be noted in passing that Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez (1989) have considered an alternative coordinate system and have expanded a general solution in a different way involving Bessel and Neumann functions of zero order. Their approach will be described in Section 10.7. The appropriate technique is to consider transformations of the basic functions f and g which are here treated as coordinates. It turns out to be convenient to put  (10.9) where \\u03c8 and \\u03bb are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting ,. (10.10) With this, it may be noted that  (10.11) and t and z can be expressed in terms of f and g by  (10.12) The boundaries of region IV are now the hypersurfaces on which , and the focusing hypersurface in this region occurs when . Thus, to correspond to the interaction region, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality . Using these coordinates, the main equation (10.2) becomes  (10.13) A general class of solutions of (10.13) can now be obtained by considering variable separable solutions of the form . (10.14) With this,(10.13) reduces to the pair of Legendre equations  (10.15) and a class of solutions of (10.13) can be expressed as a sum of products  (10.16) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds respectively, and a n  ,q n  ,Pn and b n  are series of arbitrary constants. In general, of course , Legendre functions of non-integer order may also be included. The Legendre functions of integer order are well known, but it may still be appropriate to note just the first few. (10.17) It may easily be shown that the solutions of Khan and Penrose, and of Szekeres are included in this class. The Khan-Penrose solution uses ,(10.18) and the Szekeres solution (9.4) generalizes this to  (10.19) It may be noted that the Legendre functions of the second kind  are all singular when . The singularity  occurs when , and thus can be seen to be associated with the focusing singularity in region IV. In fact, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions, at least one Legendre function of the second kind must be included in the solution of (10.13). This may easily be demonstrated by substituting only the products of Legendre functions of the first kind into the condition (7.15), which can not then be satisfied. Another solution of (10.13) can be obtained by considering separable solutions involving a sum rather than the product (10.14). This leads to the solution  (10.20) where a is an arbitrary constant. This can immediately be seen to be the obvious solution  which, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner metrics as will be shown in the next section. This term may be added to the sum (10.16). A further solution of (10.2), or (10.13) is given by  (10.21) where c and d are arbitrary constants. In fact a series of solutions of this type can be used having different values of c and d . Thus a different representation of the solution of (10.13) can be written in the form  (10.22) Alternatively terms from the sum (10.22) may also be added to those of (10.16). However, as will be shown in (10.68), some of these terms may also be expressed in terms of products of Legendre functions, and so are already included in (10.16). It may be noted in passing that particular terms of this type have been included by Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez (1989) in the class of solutions that will be described in Section 10.7. Having obtained an expression for V as any combination of the terms (10.16),(10.20) and (10.22), it is then necessary to integrate (10.3) to  obtain S . These equations may conveniently be rewritten in terms of the coordinates and defined by (10.9) in the form . (10.23) However,V is now so general that no complete integral for S has yet been found. Instead, we proceed by discussing the particular cases that have been obtained. The non-singular \\u2018solution\\u2019 of Stoyanov We may now consider a paper of Stoyanov (1979) in which he claimed to have obtained a solution without singularities. His method was to look for a regular solution of the field equations in region IV, and then to obtain the global solution simply by requiring that the metric coefficients be continuous across the boundaries. The solution he presented for region IV has the line element  (10.24) where a is an arbitrary constant. This clearly uses  (10.25) which does not satisfy the boundary conditions (7.3) which require that f and g must be smooth functions. In fact, it has been shown by Nutku (1981) that the discontinuities in the derivatives of f and g on the boundaries of region IV indicate the presence of an infinite discontinuity in the Ricci tensor on these hypersurfaces. Thus, although (10.24) is a vacuum solution inside region IV, it cannot be a global vacuum solution describing the collision of purely gravitational waves. It may also be observed that, with the positive signs in (10.24) and (10.25),f and g are increasing functions that are inconsistent with (7.13). Such a possibility can only arise if the impulsive components of the matter tensor  occurring on the boundary of region IV have negative energy density. It is in this way that the singularity has been removed. It is only with the possibility of the presence of matter with negative energy density that the focusing effect of colliding waves can be avoided. Nutku (1981) also pointed out that the line element (10.24) is the well known cosmological solution of Kasner (1921). He gave the explicit coordinate transformation by which the line element (10.24) becomes ,(10.26) where the coordinate t is not the same as that used elsewhere in this chapter, and  (10.27) which clearly satisfies the necessary conditions . (10.28) The Stoyanov solution has been obtained with the solution of (9.3) given by  (10.29) which is the solution (10.20). With this, the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (10.30) which clearly cannot be continuous across the boundaries of region IV if the junction conditions (7.3) are satisfied. It must be concluded that the above solution cannot be interpreted in terms of an interaction between plane gravitational waves. Certainly, it is not a counterexample of a solution for colliding waves without singularity. However, in region IV, it is the well known Kasner solution which features regularly in discussions of solution generating techniques. In fact, it turns out that this solution can be used as a \\u2018seed\\u2019 from which other physically acceptable solutions may be derived. It will therefore be referred to again in later sections. This solution in the case when  has been further investigated by Taub (1988 a ), looking particularly at the properties of the distribution valued curvature tensor. The solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez and Griffiths Now consider the case with the solution of (10.11) given by  (10.31) This solution was first presented by Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1986,1987 a ) in the case when  and . The solution with general parameters was published by Griffiths (1987). The Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez (1986,1987 a ) solution can be seen to be a modification of the Khan-Penrose solution, while the more general case is a generalization of the Szekeres solution (10.19) with . With the solution (10.31), the remaining equations (10.23) may be integrated to give . (10.32) It may be noticed that S contains the term  (10.33) which includes the terms (7.10) that, with (7.8), are required to ensure that  is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. If the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form ,(10.34) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if . (10.35) Figure 10.1 Wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari Iba\\u00f1ez-Griffiths solution with . These have been obtained from (10.6), but the scale factor contained in the bounded part of S has been removed. Profiles are shown for the special cases in which  or , when the wave front is continuous. The more general situation is represented by the cases in which b takes the values 1 and -2. By extending this solution into regions II and III and putting , it can be seen from (10.6) that the approaching waves contain an impulsive wave component  only if  and . This case includes the Khan-Penrose solution for which  and the Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 a ) solution in which ,. However, with , the impulsive wave is followed by another wave component. Some profiles for approaching waves of this type are illustrated in Figure 10.1. It can also be shown using (10.6) that the wave front of the approaching wave in region II behaves as  (10.36) Thus, unless , the wave front may have a distributional amplitude. It is unbounded if  and has a step if . The wave front is smooth if . Scaled profiles for the approaching waves are illustrated in Figure 10.2 for some particular values of a and b with n equal to 4, 6 and 8. In all cases the approaching waves become unbounded as  in region II, and as  in region III. Figure 10.2 Scaled wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez-Griffiths solution for various values of a and b , and with n taking the values 4, 6 and 8. It can also be shown that this family of solutions has the same singularity structure as the class of Szekeres solutions as described in Section 9.3 and to which it reduces when . In region IV, there is a scalar polynomial curvature singularity on the space-like surface  on which  and . It may be noted that when , the initial boundaries  and  of region IV contain a distribution-valued singularity. These initial boundaries are regular when . As in all other solutions, it may also be noted that there are non-scalar curvature  singularities in the initial regions II and III on the hypersurfaces on which  and  respectively The soliton solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ) have also used a generating that is familiar in the study of solitons to obtain a solution of (10.2) in which  (10.37) where  and a is an arbitrary constant. This was initially obtained using the inverse scattering technique in which the initial \\u2018seed\\u2019 solution is taken to be the Kasner or Stoyanov solution given by (10.20) or (10.29). This solution can immediately be seen to be a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution (10.18) by the addition of the solution (10.20). It necessarily contains impulsive wave components. It was pointed out by Griffiths (1987), however, that this solution may easily be generalized by treating the parameter k in (10.36) as another arbitrary constant. In this way, this family of solutions may also be considered to be a generalization of the Szekeres solutions with . As in the previous example, this generalization then permits the approaching waves to have a continuous wave front for appropriate values of k and a . It is this more general class of solutions that is considered in this section. It is possible immediately to integrate equations (10.23) to obtain . (10.38) This contains the term  which, as in (10.33), is required to ensure that e -M  is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. If the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form ,(10.39) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if . (10.40) In this case it is remarkable that the junction conditions place no constraint on the parameter a . This feature is, in fact, related to a general result that will be described in Section 12.1. When evaluating expressions for the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to use the coordinates and defined by (10.10)(it may be noticed that these differ from those used by Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez). The scale-invariant components of the Weyl tensor are given by  (10.41) For the sake of later discussion, it is found to be appropriate to choose the scale functions A and B defined by (6.2) and (6.14) to be  (10.42) The negative signs are due to the signs of f' and g' . From (10.41) it can be seen that, in general, this solution has the same singularity structure as the Szekeres solution. There is a curvature singularity on the hypersurface given by  or . There are, however, exceptional cases which occur when  and  . In these cases  (10.43) which satisfies the condition  (10.44) which implies that the space-time is of algebraic type D (see Kramer et a . 1980, or Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos 1986 b ). These particular degenerate cases will be analysed in more detail in the next section. When  and , the approaching waves contain an impulsive component. For ,, the null boundaries of region IV contain distribution-valued singularities. These boundaries are regular when ,. The approaching waves have a step wavefront if , and the wavefront is continuous if . Also, as in the Szekeres solutions, there are non-scalar curvature singularities in regions II and III when  and  respectively, for all values of a and all permissible values of k . A generalization of the class of solutions described in this section has been obtained by Tsoubelis and Wang (1989). This has been obtained by putting . (10.45) By a comparison with (10.37) and (10.19), this can be seen to be a generalization both of the above Ferrari Iba\\u00f1ez solution and also of the Szekeres class of solutions described in Chapter 9. Its properties can reasonably be inferred from those of these two subclasses, as has been confirmed by Tsoubelis and Wang. The degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solutions Consider now the special cases of the above Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution in which  and , in which the Weyl tensor components are given by (10.43). The properties of these cases have been further described by Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1988). In the case when ,, there is again a curvature singularity when . However, when  and , the space-time appears to be regular for all , and the singularity caused by the mutual focusing of the two waves appears to have been removed. It is, therefore, appropriate to consider this particular case in more detail. Since  in these cases, it is possible to scale the null coordinates such that. (10.46) When , the metric functions in region IV are then given by  (10.47) and the Weyl tensor components are then given by  (10.48) As expected, these indicate that the approaching waves are impulses followed by continuous components. Of greater significance, however, is the fact that in this case there are two point singularities at the points , and ,. The existence of the singularities at these points implies that the lines  and  in regions II and III act as \\u2018fold singularities\\u2019 like those described in Section 8.2. These lines therefore form boundaries to the space-time in these regions. It is convenient now to return to the time-like and space-like coordinates \\u03c8 and \\u03bb. In the degenerate case when  the line element in the interaction region takes the form . (10.49) To analyse this particular case further, consider the change of variables . (10.50) With this, the line element (10.49) takes the form  (10.51) which may immediately be recognized as the Schwarzschild metric with ., With , however, we have  which is normally understood as the region inside the horizon. In addition, since increases from zero in the interaction region, this region must correspond to the part of the Schwarzschild space-time indicated in Figure 10.3(b) which is inside the initial horizon. However, it may also be noticed that the coordinate which represents the axial coordinate in the Schwarzschild solution covers the entire range  in this case. Figure 10.3 The interaction region of the degenerate solution viewed in two different coordinate planes. The plane (a) is the u ,v or  plane as in previous figures. Diagram (b) represents the  plane and is equivalent to the familiar Kruskal-Szekeres diagram for the Schwarzschild space-time. From Figure 10.3, it appears that the approaching waves collide at the surface  and reach a horizon at . There is, however, no a priori reason why the coordinate should not be continued beyond \\u03c0/2.; If such a continuation is possible, this would indicate that the waves would continue through the horizon until they finally end in a curvature singularity at . The other degenerate case in which  can also be transformed to a Schwarzschild space-time but, in this case, the interaction region corresponds to the upper region inside the horizon and all trajectories end in the future singularity. This case, together with the above transformation, has also been described by Yurtsever (1988 a ). It is instructive also to express the metric in Kruskal-Szekeres form. This can be achieved from (10.49) using the transformation  (10.52) where u and v are null coordinates in the  plane. With this, the line element becomes  (10.53) where \\u03c8 is given by . (10.54) In these coordinates the structure of the solution in the vicinity of the horizon is clearly shown to be regular. It is also convenient to consider this solution in terms of alternative null coordinates u' and v' such that, in the interaction region  (10.55) where the new constants a and b are the strengths of the approaching gravitational shock waves. With these coordinates it can be seen that the Schwarzschild mass parameter, which is unity in the line elements (10.51) and (10.53), is here related to the amplitudes of the approaching waves by . (10.56) It follows from this that stronger approaching gravitational waves would produce a shorter proper time between the collision and the subsequent horizon. They would also give rise to a smaller Schwarzschild mass parameter, and hence greater curvature on the horizon. When trying to relate the global structure of this solution to part of the Schwarzschild space-time, it should be emphasised that for this class of colliding plane waves the coordinate is not periodic but covers the full range . Topological singularities occur on the lines  and  on the horizon  (or ). This global structure of the solution has been determined by Hayward (1989 a ). He has noted that the above solution also forms a covering space of part of the Schwarzschild white hole with a quasiregular covering space singularity along the polar axis around which the space-time is wound. He has also suggested an alternative extension of the Schwarzschild exterior inside the black hole. In addition, he has suggested some possible extensions for the non-unique region beyond the horizon including one that is time symmetric.  Referring to Figure 10.3(b), the opposing waves in this case collide on the hypersurface . The interaction region is then that part of the Schwarzschild space-time inside the initial horizon as indicated, which extends to the horizon as the focusing hypersurface. An extension through this surface may be taken to be the familiar two parts of the exterior Schwarzschild space-time. This can be continued to the subsequent horizon. A further extension through this horizon is then possible up to the next surface on which  or  at which the space-time again splits into two separating gravitational waves which are the time reverse of the initial approaching waves. At the conclusion of this section, it may be noted that Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1988) have shown that the shear-free principal null congruences associated with this type D space-time do not focus on the horizon. However, these congruences are in different planes from the congruences on which the two wave components propagate, and for which the contraction and shear clearly become unbounded as . An odd order solution All of the solutions considered so far have involved only Legendre  functions of even order. A solution with odd order functions has been presented by Griffiths (1987). This has . (10.57) With this function, equations (10.23) can immediately be integrated to give . (10.58) As in (10.32\\u201334), it can be clearly seen that this expression contains terms of the form (7.10). It may thus be concluded that, if the leading terms in the expansions for the functions f and g are given by (10.34), then the boundary conditions that are required for the solution to describe colliding plane waves are satisfied if . (10.59) As in previous examples, it can be shown that the approaching waves have an impulsive component if . Also the wavefront is unbounded if , has a step if , is continuous but not smooth if , and is smooth if . The expressions for the Weyl tensor components are rather complicated, and there is nothing particularly remarkable about this solution. In the previous examples discussed in this chapter, the two waves approaching each other are identical. The component 0 in region III has an identical form to 4 in region II but with the null coordinate v replacing. Similarly, the expressions for V in the two regions can be related by the same replacement. In this case, however, since odd functions are being used, a change of sign is also included. Thus, and  in region II are replaced by  and  in region III. The approaching waves still have colinear polarization but, in this case, their amplitudes are opposite rather than the same. The second Yurtsever and the Feinstein-Iba\\u00f1ez solutions For colliding plane wave solutions, we are considering space-times with two space-like Killing vectors. Such space-times have also been considered in the context of cosmology, where certain vacuum inhomogeneous cosmologies satisfy the same field equations as the interaction region for colliding colinear gravitational waves (Gowdy 1971), although different boundary conditions are appropriate. In fact the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies can be considered to represent closed universes built from opposing plane gravitational waves. The similarity between these solutions  has been noted by Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez (1989), who have used known cosmological solutions to obtain a new class of colliding plane wave solutions. In this section, the Feinstein Iba\\u00f1ez solutions are presented. The electromagnetic Gowdy cosmologies will be described in Section 17.3. It is appropriate at this point to consider the alternative system of coordinates defined by . (10.60) It may be noted that the new coordinate t is a decreasing, or past pointing, time-like coordinate, and that the singularity in region IV occurs when . These coordinates have also been used by Yurtsever (1988 c ). In this case, the line element (10.1) for colliding waves with aligned constant polarization can be rewritten in the diagonal form  (10.61) and the main vacuum field equation (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) becomes  (10.62) and the subsidiary equations (10.3) become  (10.63) where the dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to t and z respectively. The above equations (10.62,63) are exactly those for the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies that have been considered by many authors. The general solution of (10.62) can be expressed as a line integral. However, for the class of Gowdy cosmologies, it is found to be convenient to consider the class of solutions given by  (10.64) where  and  are arbitrary linear combinations of the terms in curly brackets, including the Fourier-Bessel integrals of the form  (10.65) and  are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order, and  and  are sets of arbitrary constants. The first term in (10.64) is clearly identical to the solution (10.20). It is the term that, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner solutions. The set of terms included in L 1 have regular behaviour as . It may be noted that this property is also shared by the combination of terms  that are contained in (10.16). The set of terms included in L 2 , however, are badly behaved as . These are the terms that are considered to induce chaotic behaviour in these cosmological models. The last term in (10.64) is identical to (10.31). This contains the so-called gravitational soliton components. Yurtsever (1988 c ) has considered the asymptotic structure of those solutions which only contain the combinations  and , i.e. in which . He has shown that these solutions are asymptotic to the inhomogeneous Kasner solutions as the singularity  is approached. He has also given explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data specified along the wave fronts of the incoming colliding plane waves. It follows from this analysis that the focusing hypersurface  is a curvature singularity except in the special case in which one of the Kasner exponents is zero. This special case of the degenerate Kasner solution is flat and, in this case, the focusing hypersurface is a Killing-Cauchy horizon across which space-time can be extended. It is reasonable to conclude from this that, although there are colliding plane wave space-times which contain a Killing-Cauchy horizon rather than a space-like curvature singularity, these space-times are unstable against small perturbations of the initial data and that \\u2018generic\\u2019 initial data always produce space-like curvature singularities. Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez (1989) have considered the family of solutions for which the combination L 2 is zero. They have shown that, for this case, a curvature singularity does not develop in region IV as  provided that . (10.66) They have also shown that, in this case, the necessary boundary conditions (7.15) are satisfied provided there are at least two solitonic terms  with constants satisfying  (10.67) using the notation of (7.11). (The unfortunate repeated use of constants c 1 and c 2 in this equation should not cause confusion.) It may thus be noted that these two solitonic terms provide the conditions for continuity on the two different null boundaries of region IV. For continuity it is also required that  and , so d 1 and d 2 are constrained to the range . (10.68) It follows from this and (10.66) that , and so the first term in (10.64) must necessarily be included in these solutions. It may also be noted that the solutions given in the notation of previous sections by  (10.69) where c 1 and c 2 are given by (10.67), similarly do not contain curvature singularities on the hypersurface  provided the constants d i and a are constrained by (10.66) and (10.68). It is also of interest to note that the two solitonic terms that provide the continuity across the boundaries of the interaction region are in fact identical to the two separate terms in the Szekeres solution (9.4). This may be observed by noting that  (10.70) and similarly . (10.71) It follows from this that even the Szekeres solution, which is everywhere at least C 2 , can be adapted by the inclusion of a suitable multiple of the term (10.20) to provide a solution without a curvature singularity in the interaction region. Thus, the occurrence of a quasiregular singularity in region IV can have nothing to do with the relaxation of the continuity conditions across the boundaries. The class of solutions included here contain an arbitrary number of parameters. It can be shown that they are algebraically general in the interaction region. They contain the usual coordinate singularity on the hypersurface  but, for this class, this is not a curvature singularity. Feinstein and Iba\\u00f1ez have shown that the solution is extendable across this surface. However, the extension is not unique. The first Yurtsever solutions For colliding plane waves with aligned linear polarization, it has been seen that the main field equation (10.2) is linear. Various classes of solutions have already been obtained by separating the variables of this equation in a number of different ways. A further class of solutions in which the main equation is separated in yet another way has been given by Yurtsever (1988 a ). These solutions were originally obtained indirectly by first considering the Weyl solutions for stationary axisymmetric space-times. However, they will be presented here in a more general way that is also more appropriate in considering colliding wave solutions. It is appropriate here to start with the main equation in the form (10.62) using the variables t and z defined by (10.60), and then transforming it by putting  (10.72) where the parameters v and \\u03b7 are not necessarily real. Indeed, real values of these variables only cover part of the interaction region as will be clarified later. With these parameters, the main equation (10.62) becomes  (10.73) and this has a series of separable solutions of the form  (10.74) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds. Figure 10.4 In the interaction region IV for the Yurtsever solutions, the variables v and cosh \\u03b7 are imaginary in the initial region marked A that immediately follows the collision. This region is followed by the regions marked B in which these variables are real. We must now reconsider the parameters of these solutions. As defined by (10.72),z and  are imaginary when the product fg is positive. Since both f and g decrease from \\u00bd towards -\\u00bd in the interaction region, it is appropriate to divide this region into the subregions A and B in which the product fg is positive and negative respectively as indicated in Figure 10.4. Explicitly we may put  (10.75) It is clear that v is zero midway along the two boundaries between region IV and regions II and III. The inverse functions of v that appear in (10.74) must therefore be excluded for colliding plane wave solutions since they must be regular along these boundaries. It is therefore appropriate to express general solutions in the form  (10.76) This solution will from now on simply be quoted in the second form since either equation formally includes the other. It may be noted that these solutions are continuous on the boundaries between the subregions A and B. Also, the terms involving the Legendre functions of the first kind are regular on the focusing hypersurface , while those involving the Legendre functions of the second kind are singular on this surface. To be precise, in the original class of solutions given by Yurtsever (1988 a ),V is taken in the form  (10.77) which can be seen to be generalizations of the degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution described in Section 10.5. They are therefore distortions of the Schwarzschild black hole solution in the interaction region, and correspond to interior Weyl solutions for static axisymmetric space-times. In terms of colliding plane waves, these solutions all involve approaching waves with initial impulsive components. Some particular examples have been described explicitly by Yurtsever (1988 a ). Clearly these solutions can easily be generalised by modifying the coefficients of the first terms of (10.77). By choosing these appropriately, it is possible to remove the impulsive components from the approaching waves. Further explicit solutions To obtain solutions describing the collision and interaction of plane waves with aligned linear polarization it is necessary first to solve the main field equation, which may be expressed in terms of different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73). Any number of further explicit solutions may easily be generated using the methods described in the previous sections of this chapter with different combinations of particular solutions of the main equation (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73). It is appropriate here simply to list the various possibilities. First there are the solutions (10.16) which have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.13). These involve Legendre functions of the first and second kinds  (10.78) where a n  ,q n  ,Pn and b n  are series of arbitrary constants. It may be noted, of course, that non-integer values of n may also be included. There are also the particular solutions (10.20),(10.8) and (10.22) that can be re-expressed in the form  (10.79) where  are arbitrary constants. Then there are the solutions of (10.62) that are contained in (10.64) and have previously been included in Gowdy cosmologies, namely  (10.80) where  and ) are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order,,, and  are sets of arbitrary constants. It may be noted that the solutions (10.80) have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.62), taking only solutions that are periodic in z . This constraint is not required for colliding plane waves and an additional set of aperiodic solutions is given by  (10.81) where  and  are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order. Finally, there are the separable solutions of (10.73) which are non-singular on the initial boundaries, namely  (10.82) which again involve Legendre functions of the first and second kind. When considered as infinite series, these different forms may simply be regarded as different representations of the same class of solutions. However, when looking for particular explicit solutions it is necessary to consider only a few terms. In this way, further exact solutions for colliding plane waves may be obtained by combining particular components from  any of the series V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5 and by choosing the arbitrary constants such that(10.83) where k 1 and k 2 are constrained to the range (7.13). If this condition is satisfied, then it remains only to integrate the subsidiary equations in the form (10.3) or (10.63) to obtain the remaining metric function S or M . ERNST EQUATION FOR COLLIDING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES The solutions being considered here for colliding plane waves all have a pair of commuting Killing vectors that are assumed to exist globally. It may therefore be expected that the solutions obtained may be related to known cylindrically symmetric solutions, or to stationary axisymmetric solutions, which similarly have a pair of Killing vectors. Such a relation was first pointed out by Kinnersley (1975), and by Fisher (1980). The exact relation between these solutions has been established more recently by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), and Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1985 a ), and exploited by these authors and their colleagues. In this chapter we will present an analysis of the colliding wave problem using a method that has become familiar in the study of stationary axisymmetric space-times. In this case the field is described in terms of a complex potential function that is referred to as the Ernst potential (see Ernst 1968 a ). This approach leads directly to various methods for generating further exact solutions. A derivation of the Ernst equation First it may be recalled that, of the vacuum field equations (6.22a-f) considered in previous chapters,(6.22a) may immediately be integrated to give ,(11.1) and (6.22d, e) are integrability conditions for the remaining equations. Attention is thus focused on these main equations for the metric functions  and . It is now appropriate to consider a different combination of these functions, by putting  (11.2) or, inversely . (11.3) This modifies the form of the line element (6.20), which now becomes . (11.4) It is also convenient to introduce the complex function . (11.5) With this, the line element (11.4) can be written in the form  (11.6) and the two main equations (6.22d, e) can be written as the single complex equation  (11.7) It may be seen that this is in fact Ernst's equation, which can be written in the coordinate-invariant form  (11.8) where  is the square of the gradient of an arbitrary scalar field which, in this case, is a function of the two (null) coordinates only. Similarly, v2 is the 3+1-dimensional Laplacian operator (or the generalized d'Alembertian) given by . (11.9) Using the above notation, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor given by (6.23) can be written as  (11 10) When considering Ernst's equation, it is frequently found to be useful also to introduce an associated function \\u0395, defined by  (11.11) With this, the line element (11.4) or (11.6) can be written in the alternative form  (11.12) and the main equations (6.22d, e), or alternatively (11.7), become . (11.13) This is the alternative form of the Ernst equation and may be rewritten in the coordinate-invariant form . (11.14) Using this function, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor (11.10) can be written as  (11.1) The problem now involves finding appropriate solutions of (11.7) or (11.13). These equations, however, contain the derivatives of U , and hence they depend on the arbitrary functions f(u) and g(v) that are specified by the incoming waves. This apparently explicit dependence on initial conditions may in fact be removed by adapting the coordinate system of Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Here we again use (10.9\\u201312) and put  (11.16) where \\u03c8 and \\u03bb are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting . (11.17) In this coordinate system, equation (11.7) takes the more familiar explicit form of Ernst's equation:(11.18) and (11.13) similarly becomes  (11.19) The intermediate steps in the derivation of these equations may be deduced from (16.6) and (16.11). See also (12.30\\u201331). It may be noticed that, in this case, the solution of these equations immediately determines some of the metric functions. This is in marked contrast to their application in stationary axisymmetric space-times, where the Ernst equation only determines potentials for the fields. The original metric functions, as considered in previous chapters, are now given by  (11.20) Boundary conditions When looking for solutions of the Ernst equation for stationary axisymmetric space-times, it is appropriate to require that solutions be asymptotically flat. However, for colliding plane waves very different boundary conditions apply. For colliding plane waves it is necessary to choose Z or \\u0395, and hence V and W , such that the solution of (6.22b, c, f) for M is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. For vacuum solutions, it is appropriate to use (7.8) and equations (7.9) may then be written in the form . To ensure that the boundary conditions are satisfied, it is then essential that the solution of these equations should include the necessary components (7.10). In this approach, solutions in the interaction region for  or  are related to the functions  and , and hence S may be obtained as a function of f and g . The boundary conditions described in Chapter 7 may then be considered to place restrictions on the structure of these functions, which characterize the approaching waves. In practice, these boundary conditions are difficult to apply, basically because the condition that M be continuous is only indirectly applied to the functions V and W , or Z , or E , that feature in the main equations. It is therefore often convenient to apply the boundary condition in the form (7.15) or (7.16). Writing , this becomes  This form is particularly convenient when , which occurs when impulsive waves are present. The boundary conditions in this limited case only, have been discussed by Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1987 b ). In terms of the functions f and g , the conditions (11.22) become  where k 1 and k 2 must satisfy the inequalities (7.13). Alternatively, writing , the boundary conditions require that   which, in terms of the functions f and g become  (11.26) Finally, it is convenient to express the boundary conditions in terms of the variables t and z . These become, for ,(11.27) where k 1 and k 2 satisfy (7.13). Colinear solutions In the next chapter, the approach described above will be used to derive new solutions for colliding gravitational waves whose polarization vectors are not aligned. Such solutions essentially have W non-zero, and hence Z and \\u0395 are complex. However, before moving on to consider such cases, it is appropriate first to review the colinear solutions described in previous chapters. These solutions have Z and \\u0395 real. (i)The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971), discussed in Chapter 3 and Section 8.2, which describes the collision of aligned impulsive gravitational waves, is given by . (11.28) In this case  and . It may be observed that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times,(11.28) is the Ernst potential which leads to the Schwarzschild solution. (ii)The Szekeres (1972) class of solutions, described in Chapter 9, is given by . (11.29) In this case  and , with  for  and . (iii)The \\u2018solution\\u2019 of Stoyanov (1979) given by (10.24) uses . (11.30) In Section 10.2 it has been argued that this solution must be considered to be unphysical on its own, but it may be included as a factor in more general solutions. It does not satisfy the boundary conditions (11.26). (iv)The solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 a ) and Griffiths (1987), which is described in Section 10.3, is characterized by  where  (11.31) In this case  and , where  and . It may be observed that, when ,(11.31) is the Ernst potential which, for stationary axisymmetric solutions, leads to the solution of Erez and Rosen (1959) which describes the external field of a non-rotating body with a quadrupole moment. (v)The generalized solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ), described in Section 10.4, is characterized by . (11.32) This can be seen to include the Stoyanov factor (11.30), and to reduce to a Szekeres solution with  when . Again  and  where  and . The degenerate cases occur when . (vi)The solution of Tsoubelis and Wang (1989) given by (10.44) has  (11.33) This can be seen to be a generalization of (11.29) and (11.32), and its properties can immediately be deduced. (vii)The odd order solution of Griffiths (1987) described in Section 10.6 uses the Ernst potential , where  (11.34) Again  and , where  and . It is not difficult to see how further solutions of this type can be generated. SOLUTION-GENERATING TECHNIQUES For stationary axisymmetric space-times many solution-generating techniques are known. These are associated with the two Killing vectors, and with the internal symmetries of the Ernst equation. Colliding plane wave solutions also have two Killing vectors, and the main field equations can be transformed exactly to the Ernst equation. The main difference is that the solutions of the Ernst equation now contain the metric functions explicitly rather than the field potentials as in the stationary axisymmetric case. It is therefore to be expected that many of the familiar solution generating techniques can be used to obtain new colliding plane wave solutions from already known, or \\u2018seed\\u2019, solutions. In this chapter we will consider only vacuum solutions. This will enable us to continue to concentrate on the collision of gravitational waves. Various techniques will be discussed here, and the main solutions that have been obtained using them will be described in the next chapter. Many techniques are also known by which solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, and other non-vacuum solutions, can be generated from known vacuum solutions. These will be discussed later in Chapter 15. The colinear case Consider first the case when the approaching waves have colinear polarization. The metric can be taken in the form of the line element (6.20) with . In this case, given any solution  of the field equations (6.22), then another solution of the same equations again with  is given by U ,V and M , where  (12.1) where a is an arbitrary constant. This transformation is well known (Halilsoy, 1985). It can clearly be seen that, if the initial solution satisfies the boundary conditions appropriate for colliding waves, then so does the new solution. It can also  be seen that the transformation (12.1) is equivalent to adding to V the Stoyanov solution (10.29). It may also be observed that the transformation (12.1) can be used to obtain the soliton solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ) described in Section 10.4, using as seed the Khan Penrose solution. Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez, however, originally obtained their solution using the soliton techniques mentioned in Section 12.6. Another transformation which maps one colinear solution of (6.22) on another, whether or not they satisfy the boundary conditions, is given by  (12.2) where b is an arbitrary constant and . When , it can be seen that the transformation (12.2) is singular on the boundaries of the interaction region where  and . It follows that the necessary boundary conditions cannot be satisfied for both solutions, if the same expressions for f and g are used. If the seed solution satisfies the boundary conditions as described in Chapter 7, with  and M containing the terms  (12.3) with  (12.4) then the new solution containing the terms (7.10) will also satisfy the boundary conditions if f and g are replaced by  (12.5) where  (12.6) provided  and . These equations give the new expression for U in terms of the null coordinates u and v . It may be noted that the inequalities (12.6) provide strong constraints on the range of permissible values of the parameter b in (12.2). It can thus be seen that this transformation with  may be used to change the profile of the approaching waves. For example, it could  be used to derive the Szekeres solution described in Chapter 9 from the Khan-Penrose solution. The two transformations (12.1) and (12.2) may also be used in conjunction. It may also be noted that the transformations for V in (12.1) and (12.2) may be restated in the form that, if a real Z is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.18), then  (12.7) and  (12.8) are also real solutions with arbitrary constants a and b , though as explained above, the possible values of b are constrained by the boundary conditions. These results are, of course, implicitly contained in the general approach to colinear solutions described in Section 10.1. The point to note is that, when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization so that Z and \\u0395 are real and , the main field equations can be linearized. In this case a general superposition of solutions is possible, as illustrated in (10.16) together with (10.20). Further generating techniques for this case have been described by Kitchingham (1984). In the more general case, however,Z and \\u0395 are complex, and the field equations are essentially non-linear. In this situation, the generating techniques described in the remainder of this chapter are particularly significant. Rotations and Ehlers transformations Consider first the well known result that, if E is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.14), then  (12.9) where c is a constant, is also a solution. In terms of the alternative function Z the equivalent result is that, if Z is a solution of (11.8), then another solution is given by  (12.10) By applying the coordinate rotation  (12.11) to the line element (11.12), it may be shown that this rotation is exactly equivalent to the transformation (12.9), indicating that this transformation may be simply interpreted as a global rotation of coordinates. In terms of the metric functions of the line element (6.20), this rotation can be shown to be equivalent to the result that, if U ,V ,W and M are solutions of (6.22), then another solution is given by  (12.12) It may be noted that, in (12.12), the function M is unaltered. Thus the boundary conditions are not affected, and so neither are the functions f(u) and g(v) . In fact, it is clear that (12.12) does not generate a new solution, but merely a rotation of the original. It can also be shown that, if the seed solution is colinear so that we can put , then the transformation (12.12) reduces to the transformation suggested by Ray (1980) as corrected by Halilsoy (1981). Another well known result is that, if Z is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.8), then  (12.13) where c is a real constant, is also a solution. This is loosely referred to as an Ehlers transformation (Ehlers, 1957). Equivalently, if \\u0395 is a solution of (11.14), then another solution is given by . (12.14) In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), we may start with the solutions U ,V ,W and M of (6.22). After integrating (11.21), it can then be shown that another solution is given by  (12.15) Since the metric function M is unchanged, it follows that the boundary conditions for the new solution are satisfied if, and only if, they are satisfied for the seed solution. The above transformation is also related to the well known result that, if Z is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.8), then another solution is given by  (12.16) where b is a real constant. Equivalently, if \\u0395 is a solution of (11.14), then another solution is given by  (12.17) In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), this leads to the transformation that, if U ,V ,W and M are solutions of (6.22), then another solution is given by  (12.18) This can clearly be seen to be identical to (12.15) but with the sign of V interchanged. All of the above transformations can be shown to be obtainable from a general rotation and rescaling of the coordinates in the  plane. This can be described by subjecting the Killing vectors  to any  transformation , where . (12.19) This leaves U and M invariant but, by considering the line element (11.6), the Ernst function Z can be shown to transform as  (12.20) The transformation (12.20) clearly incorporates (12.10),(12.13) and (12.16) which include both pure rotations and those referred to as Ehlers transformations. When applied to metric functions on its own this transformation clearly has little physical significance. It follows that these transformations on their own can not be used to generate genuinely non-colinear solutions from colinear ones. However, they may be combined with some other method to obtain such solutions. In particular these transformations may be applied to the potentials for the metric functions that will be described in Section 12.4. Strictly speaking it is only these transformations, applied in the potential space, that should be referred to as Ehlers transformations (Ehlers, 1957). It is then possible that a sequence both of coordinate transformations (12.19) and Ehlers transformations (12.20) in the potential space can be applied alternately to generate a further class of solutions with an infinite number of parameters. Geroch transformations Geroch (1971) has presented a general technique for generating solutions of Einstein's source-free equations from known solutions which possess a Killing vector. As originally presented, the method is to consider a vacuum space-time with metric , and to solve the equations  (12.21) for G ,P and Q subject to the following conditions:. (12.22)(A solution of these equations is known to exist.) Then, the basic result is that a new solution of the source-free equations, depending on an arbitrary real parameter x , is given by  (12.23) where  (12.24) It can be seen that f and g are respectively the norm and twist potential of the Killing field. This technique determines a new solution with one extra parameter \\u03b1. A second application of the method simply yields another member of the same one-parameter family of solutions. It may be observed that the new space-times also have the same Killing vector as the seed solution. It may also be shown that these transformations include both the Ehlers transformation and the rotation described in previous sections. The case when there exist two commuting Killing vectors, which is the case for colliding plane waves, has also been considered (Geroch, 1972). Clearly, the above technique may be applied using any linear combination of the Killing vectors. Successive applications of the method using different combinations of the Killing vectors yield metrics which depend on the order of the vectors used. The resulting class of solutions depends on two arbitrary functions, and retains the same pair of commuting Killing vectors. The algebraic structure of these transformations has been analysed by Geroch (1972). The Geroch transformations, which relate one vacuum solution to another, in fact form an infinite-dimensional group. The first really useful realization of the Lie algebra of the Geroch group was formulated by Kinnersley and Chitre (1977, 1978 a , b), who demonstrated the action of the infinitesimal elements of the group in terms of an infinite hierarchy of potentials. Kinnersley and Chitre, and also Hoenselaers, Kinnersley and Xanthopoulos (1979), exploited this approach to derive new stationary axisymmetric solutions. This formalism has been extended to space-times with two space-like Killing vectors by Kitchingham (1984), although he initially applied it only in the cosmological context. Hauser and Ernst (1979, 1980) introduced a realization of the finite elements of the Geroch group. They also showed that the Kinnersley-Chitre transformations can be carried out by solving an appropriate homogeneous Hilbert problem. A simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations which is specifically applied to colliding wave solutions has been found by Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1987 b ). With this, colliding wave solutions with any desired number of parameters may be constructed. When applying the original transformation (12.23) to colliding plane waves, it is convenient to start first with the Szekeres line element (6.20), in which the two Killing vectors are  and . It is then appropriate to consider a general Killing vector  (12.25) where a and b are arbitrary constants. It follows immediately that . (12.26) It is then possible to put two of the components of  each equal to zero. Putting  (12.27) the remaining components of  must then satisfy the equations . (12.28) These equations are automatically integrable in view of(6.22). It is then possible to put  (12.29) and to choose the components of  such that . (12.30) Equations (12.21) are then satisfied. The new metric is then given by (12.23). The expressions for the new functions are rather involved. However, it is clear that  (12.31) which indicates that the boundary conditions are satisfied for the new solution, if they were satisfied for the seed solution. In the case when the initial solution has colinear polarization, this method can be considerably simplified. Such a situation was considered by Panov (1979 b ), and will be discussed further in Section 13.2. The Neugebauer-Kramer involution Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the main field equations for colliding plane waves can be written in the form of Ernst's equation (11.18) involving the complex function Z . In this case, the real and imaginary parts of this function, denoted by , are the metric coefficients given by (11.2\\u20134). Using these components, the main field equations can be written as  (12.32) and . (12.33) These are respectively the real and imaginary parts of (11.18). The second of these equations immediately implies that there exists a function \\u03a6 such that. (12.34) It follows that must satisfy the equation  (12.35) At this point, it is convenient to introduce a new function \\u03a8defined by  (12.36) From (11.1) and (10.11), it may be seen that -\\u03a8 is the coefficient of dx 2 in the line element (11.4). With this definition and (12.34), the equations (12.32) and (12.35) can now be rewritten in the form  (12.37) and  (12.38) These equations may be seen to be identical to (12.32) and (12.33) with \\u03a8 and \\u03a6 replacing X and w . Thus, if  is a solution of (11.18), then another solution is given by  (12.39) where \\u03a8 is given by (12.36), and \\u03a6 is chosen to satisfy (12.34). This correspondence is known as the Neugebauer-Kramer involution. It is known to map real metrics to real metrics only for space-times with two space-like Killing vectors. In modern terminology, it is clear that the equations (12.34) provide an auto-B\\u00e4cklund transformation for the Ernst equation (11.18). In order to obtain the remaining metric function M it is necessary to integrate equations (7.9), which may be rewritten in the form  (12.40) which is equivalent to (11.21). In terms of the alternative functions \\u03a8 and \\u03a6 these become  (12.41) It follows from this that, for any solution with  and M there exists another solution with  and M where . (12.42) This immediately indicates that, if the initial solution satisfies the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves, then so also does the new solution, provided . (12.43) A second application of this technique only leads back to the original solution, apart from an arbitrary complex constant. The presence of such a constant has already been considered in Section 12.2 following equation (12.16). It may be noted in passing that, in the colinear case in which  and , this generation technique is equivalent to putting  which is effectively contained in (12.1) but with a change in the sign of V . This, for example, would generate the Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution from the Khan-Penrose solution. It is of interest to observe that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times, the main field equations can be written in the form of Ernst's equation (11.8), whose solution  is considered as a complex potential for the metric functions X and that are obtained from (12.36) and (12.34). In contrast, for colliding plane waves, both the potential (12.39) and the metric function (11.5) satisfy the same equation. Thus, in this case, the Neugebauer-Kramer involution is equivalent to a generation  technique in which any solution has a dual solution in which the metric functions and the associated potentials are interchanged. A combined transformation In a recent paper, Halilsoy (1988 b ) has considered a technique which he applied initially in the context of colliding shock electromagnetic waves (Halilsoy, 1988 a ). This can be described as follows. If V is a solution of the vacuum equations (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) corresponding to a collision of colinear gravitational waves (with ), then a non-colinear solution is given in terms of the function \\u0395 satisfying (11.14) by  (12.44) where  (12.45) where \\u03b1 is an arbitrary constant. The original solution is obtained when  and . In terms of the alternative function Z , the original solution may be described by a real function Z and the new solution satisfying (11.8) is then given by  (12.46) This can thus be seen to be a transformation of the type (12.2) followed by an Ehlers transformation in a slightly more general form than (12.13). In terms of the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the original solution is described by the three functions U ,V and M which are each functions of f and g where, as in (7.8), it is convenient to put  (12.47) and, as in (12.4),(12.48) The new solution (12.44) is given by . (12.49) With this, equations (7.7) can be integrated to give  (12.50) which is similar to (12.2). Now, using the same arguments as in Section 12.1, the new solution will only satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions if the forms of the functions f and g are modified. Accordingly we now put . (12.51) The parameters f and g are now expressed in terms of the null coordinates u and v in the form  (12.52) where . (12.53) With this restriction, the boundary conditions are satisfied, and . (12.54) If, in the original solution, the functions f ,g and M have been chosen such that the terms  in (12.47) have already cancelled the terms  and  in S , then the new solution for M will be given by . (12.55) The method described in this section has been used by Halilsoy (1988 b ) to obtain a class of solutions which appears to generalize the Szekeres solutions. However, since it has been obtained by a real transformation followed by an Ehlers transformation, as described at the end of Section 12.2 it is essentially simply a rotation and rescaling of the Szekeres solutions. It does not therefore describe the collision of genuinely non-aligned gravitational waves. Other methods Within the context of stationary axisymmetric space-times, many techniques have been developed in recent years by which new solutions may  be obtained from initial vacuum solutions. Most of these methods can be applied also to the colliding plane wave situation. The main difference being that, in this case, the solutions of Ernst's equation may themselves either be metric functions or potentials for those functions as described in Section 12.4. The other difference relates to the change of boundary conditions. For stationary axisymmetric solutions, it is usual to impose the condition that the space-times are asymptotically flat, and techniques for generating new solutions of Ernst's equation in which the space-time satisfies this condition have been developed. One of the most general of these is that of Cosgrove (1977), which generalizes the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions to arbitrary continuous deformation parameter s . However, for colliding plane waves, the boundary conditions are of a totally different character, and many of the solutions of Ernst's equation that are appropriate for axisymmetric fields, such as the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions, are now found to be inconsistent with the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves. Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have adapted a generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) for stationary axisymmetric space-times to derive solutions which describe the interaction following the collision of plane gravitational waves. This technique generates solutions in which the approaching waves have variable polarization from a \\u2018seed\\u2019 solution V of the equation (10.13) for the colinear case. A solution of the Ernst equation (11.17) is then given by  (12.56) where \\u03b1 is a constant and the functions  and  are obtained by integrating the equations  (12.57) The boundary conditions then have to be applied. One particularly important technique that has been developed in recent years is the inverse scattering method of Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) which had previously been developed as a soliton technique. This method has been applied by Carr and Verdaguer (1983) to plane-symmetric space-times, and their results have been interpreted in terms of cosmological gravitational waves. The relation between this and other techniques has been analysed by Letelier (1987). The first solution for colliding plane gravitational waves that was obtained using the inverse scattering method was that of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ), who obtained the solution described in Section 10.4 using the method in the form developed by Carr and Verdaguer (1983). In this paper they took as seed metric the Kasner solution (10.26) which is equivalent to the Stoyanov solution (10.29). It may therefore be noted that, although the new solution satisfies the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves, the seed solution in this case does not. Non-aligned solutions have also been obtained using this method by Ferrari, Iba\\u00f1ez and Bruni (1987 b ). Another solution-generating technique that has been developed in recent years is that associated with B\\u00e4cklund transformations. These were first applied to general relativity independently by Harrison (1978) and Neugebauer (1979). B\\u00e4cklund transformations can also be described as double-Harrison transformations, or as quadruple-Neugebauer transformations. The explicit relation between this technique and other methods has been discussed by Cosgrove (1980, 1982). The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques. Hauser and Ernst (1979, 1980) developed a method which involves solving a homogeneous Hilbert problem. Cosgrove (1981) has shown how B\\u00e4cklund transformations can be conveniently expressed in this formalism. The method has been applied to colliding wave problems by Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1988)(see also Ernst, 1988), and a class of new colliding wave solutions has been obtained. It has been observed by Witten (1979) that Einstein's vacuum equations for stationary, axisymmetric space-times are equivalent to a form of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations. He therefore suggested that it should be possible to generate solutions of Einstein's equations by using twistor methods to construct self-dual Yang-Mills fields with appropriate symmetries. Such an approach to stationary axisymmetric space-times has subsequently been developed by Ward (1983), Woodhouse (1987) and also by Woodhouse and Mason (1988), who showed how this approach relates to the other solution-generating techniques mentioned above. It follows that this approach may also be applied for other types of space-times  which contain two commuting Killing vectors. Woodhouse (1989) has applied these techniques to generate cylindrical gravitational waves. Twistor techniques may also be developed to generate colliding plane wave solutions. Any of the above techniques may be used to generate new solutions of Ernst's equation. Most have been applied mainly to stationary axisymmetric space-times. They may, however, also be used to generate solutions of Ernst's equation that can be considered as possible to colliding plane wave solutions. The difficulty is then to find under what circumstances the appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied. Whether or not a new solution in region IV satisfies these conditions will generally depend both on the particular technique that is employed and also on the initial seed solution. VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH NON-ALIGNED POLARIZATION The purpose of this chapter is to describe the known exact solutions for colliding gravitational waves in which the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned. The first solution of this type was obtained by Nutku and Halil (1977). A further generalization of this solution was attempted by Halil (1979), but this has subsequently been found to be incorrect and so will not be considered here. The Nutku-Halil solution The Khan-Penrose solution discussed in Chapter 3 describes the collision of impulsive waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. Nutku and Halil (1977) have generalized this solution to give one which describes the collision of impulsive gravitational waves with non-colinear polarization. This is the most simple solution of this type. In terms of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the metric functions of this solution can be written in the form  (13.1) where  (13.2) and \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 are constants such that(\\u03b1 -\\u03b2) is the angle between the polarization vectors of the approaching waves. This solution can be seen to reduce to the Khan-Penrose solution (3.9) when . It may also be observed that the functions f and g are given by  and . This solution has been analysed in great detail by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Their approach commences by rewriting the field equations in the form of Ernst's equation as described in Chapter 11. It can then be seen from (11.20) that \\u0395 is the associated Ernst function. Chandrasekhar and Ferrari were then able to show that the Nutku-Halil solution is obtained by the simple choice of Ernst function given by  (13.3) where p and q are real constants which satisfy the condition . It is always possible to use a rotation of the type (12.9) to put , and in this case  and . It can easily be shown that the Ernst function Z associated with this solution is given by  (13.4) It may be observed that (13.3) is in fact the Ernst potential which leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times. This reduces to the potential for the Schwarzschild solution when  or . Thus the difference in the polarization of the approaching waves in this situation can be seen to be equivalent to the rotational parameter in the Kerr solution. Taking the Ernst functions as (13.3) or (13.4), it can be shown that the boundary conditions described in Section 7.2 can only be satisfied if  and  It is then convenient to transform the null coordinates such that and . Thus the form (13.2) is obtained uniquely from the Ernst function (13.3). It also follows from this that the approaching waves necessarily contain impulsive components. Expressions for the components of the Weyl tensor 0, 2 and 4 describing the wave and interaction components have been given by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), though in a notation which differs slightly from that adopted here. However, it can still be clearly seen that this solution is a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution in which the approaching impulsive waves have different polarization. Apart from the initial impulsive waves on the boundaries  and , the interiors of regions II and III are flat. It can also be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is the same as that of the Khan-Penrose solution. There is a curvature singularity on the space-like surface  in region IV, and there  are fold singularities in regions II and III which are identical to those described in Section 8.3. It may also be pointed out that Ernst (1986) has shown that  the Nutku-Halil solution can also be obtained using a double-Harrison (B\\u00e4cklund) transformation, with the seed metric being the isotropic Kasner metric. The Panov solution Panov (1979 b ) has applied the generation method of Geroch (1971), described in Section 12.3, to obtain a non-colinear solution from a colinear one. In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), Panov started with a colinear solution U ,V , and M of (6.22) with . He then worked with the Killing vector  which is (12.25) with  and . This enabled him to put , and hence , and also from (12.30), and , where . With these expressions, the metric components may be derived from (12.23), giving  (13.5) where, from (12.28),P 3 must satisfy  (13.6) or, more conveniently,. (13.7) It is worth pointing out that, if the initial Killing vector had been taken to be , which is (12.25) with  and , an equivalent transformation would have been obtained with  and . This would have given an identical set of equations, but with V being replaced by -V , and P 3 by P 2 . In terms of the Ernst formulation of the problem described in Chapter 11, the above transformation implies that, if Z is a real solution of (11.18), then a new complex solution is given by  (13.8) where  must satisfy the equations  (13.9) Panov then took the initial solution to be the totally general solution of Szekeres (1972), which can be considered to be equivalent to the general solution given here by (10.16). He has thus determined a general class of non-colinear solutions, and he was able to show that, when the appropriate boundary conditions have been applied, the approaching waves necessarily have variable polarization. It has already been shown that the new solution obtained using a Geroch transformation will automatically satisfy the required boundary conditions if these are satisfied by the initial solution. In this case, it can also be seen that the new and initial solutions have the same singularity structure. The Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the associated Ernst function which is contained in the Nutku-Halil solution can be written as  (13.3), where . Now, it is well known (see Chandrasekhar, 1983) that this is the Ernst potential that leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times. However, as described in Section 12.4, Chandrasekhar and Ferrari have also shown that, for the colliding plane wave situation, the Ernst function may be regarded either (a) as containing the metric functions, or (b) as a potential for those functions. When the Ernst function (13.3) is considered as containing the metric functions, it leads to the Nutku-Halil solution described above. However, when the same function is considered as a potential, it then leads to the Kerr solution. Thus part of the  Kerr space-time must also be considered as a solution of the colliding plane wave equations, though in this situation the coordinates have a different interpretation. This alternative interpretation of part of the Kerr space-time has been described in detail by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ). Essentially it may be considered to have been derived from the Nutku-Halil solution using the Neugebauer-Kramer involution described in Section 12.4. We start here with the Ernst potential given by , so that(13.10) where . According to(12.36), the first metric function is then given by  (13.11) and, from (12.34),w is given by  (13.12) where  (13.13) With this,(13.12) becomes  (13. 14) which can immediately be integrated to give  (13.15) where c is an arbitrary constant. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos have chosen the constant of integration in (13.15) such that when . The reason for this choice is associated with the convenience of aligning the coordinate directions with the shear axes on the surface  on which the two waves mutually focus each other. Accordingly we set . (13.16) A variation of this constant is equivalent to making an Ehlers transformation as described in (12.16\\u201318). With (13.16), may now be written in either of the forms  (13.17) For purposes of simplification, it is convenient to introduce the terms  (13.18) In view of(12.43) and (13.1), in this case we must have . (13.19) The metric function M can also be obtained from (12.42) and (13.1), giving . (13.20) These expressions now complete all the metric functions contained in the line element (11.4), which may now be written as . (13.21) After some rearrangement, this may be written in the more convenient form . (13.22) in which Y does not appear in a denominator. In order to show that this is indeed the Kerr solution, we first relabel the parameters by putting  (13.23) which satisfies the condition  for arbitrary constants M and \\u03b1. It is also appropriate to introduce the new coordinates r and \\u03b8 instead of t and z given by  (13.24) where it may be noticed that, using the previous notation,. The remaining coordinates may also be transformed by putting  (13 25) It is also convenient to introduce the definitions . (13.26) With these substitutions the line element (13.22) may then be written in the form  (13.27) which after rescaling d s is the standard form of the Kerr solution. For this solution to describe the interaction region of colliding waves, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality . With (13.24), this implies that  (13.28) which is satisfied only by the region of the Kerr space-time that is inside the ergo-sphere. This is not unexpected, as this is the only region of Kerr space-time in which the Killing vectors are both space-like. The plane on which the two waves collide is given by , or by  which is between the two horizons. The hypersurface on which they mutually focus each other, which is given by  or , is here given by  which determines the horizons of the  Kerr solution. Thus, the curvature singularity which usually occurs when , in this case, is replaced by a coordinate singularity which is normally interpreted as a horizon of the Kerr solution. The components of the Weyl tensor inside region IV can be derived using (11.10) and have been evaluated by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos. The space-time is of algebraic type D and, in particular, it may be noted that  (13.29) The curvature is clearly non-singular as  except in the aligned case  (or ). In this case only, the surface  corresponds to a curvature singularity. In the interaction region t is a future pointing time-like coordinate. It thus follows from (13.24) that r is also a future pointing time-like coordinate which increases from the collision at  to the outer horizon at . In this case a possible further extension beyond the horizon would present no problems. It may be noted, however, that if the signs of the expressions for t ,p and q in (13.24) and (13.23) are changed, the Kerr metric (13.27) is still obtained but the orientation of r is altered. In this case, the collision at  is followed by the inner horizon at  and any extension would lead to a future time-like curvature singularity at . The difference between these two solution has been further analysed by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990). It is the latter case that has been described by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ) in which there is an extension beyond the horizon at  which contains a time-like singularity analogous to the ring singularity of the Kerr solution at . Since this singularity is time-like, it would be missed by most observers. In the other case, which has been given explicitly above, there is an analytic extension which is the asymptotically flat exterior Kerr solution. It may be pointed out, however, that in both cases the extension beyond the horizon is not unique. When considering the question of the character of the coordinate singularity at , Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ) have given a transformation by which it can be removed. They have found it convenient to introduce a decreasing time-like coordinate given by . The transformation  (13.30) then removes the coordinate singularity at , or . This provides an analytic extension beyond the Cauchy horizon which is another part of Kerr space-time. This extension, in one case, is followed by a time-like curvature singularity which corresponds to the source of the Kerr solution. It may be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is very similar to that of the degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution described in detail in Section 10.5. In fact this solution reduces to either of the two cases of the degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution in the limit as  which is the limit as the polarization of the approaching waves become aligned. The non-singular case occurs when . It may be noted that in this limit , the rotation of the Kerr solution vanishes, and the solution reduces to the same part of the Schwarzschild space-time as the degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution. It is now appropriate to consider the extension of the solution into the prior regions I, II and III which describe the approaching waves that give rise to this particular interaction. The metric (13.21) may easily be extended into region II simply by replacing both t and z by u . It turns out to be convenient to make the coordinate transformation . (13.31) With this, the line-element in region II takes the form  (13.32) where . The line-element for region III is identical to (13.32) except that v replaces u . Both these line-elements are then continuous with the Minkowski space (3.6) in region I. The plane wave metric given by (13.32) has the single component of the curvature tensor given by . (13.33) It may immediately be observed that the approaching waves have variable polarization except in the aligned limit . They include an impulsive component and a step component. As in the degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solution, the singularity structure is thus complicated by the fact that the solution contains impulsive waves on the wave fronts  and  which form the boundaries of the interaction region. The presence of these wave components introduces  additional distribution valued singularities at the points , and ,. As described in Chapter 8, these point singularities ensure the existence of fold singularities on the surfaces  and  in regions II and III respectively. The profiles for the approaching waves in both cases have been described in more detail by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990). They have shown that, in the case where the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the inner Kerr horizon, the amplitude diverges towards the fold singularity which is thus a non-scalar curvature singularity. On the other hand, when the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the outer Kerr horizon, the amplitude decays towards a quasiregular fold singularity. Other solutions It may be noticed that the solutions presented in the previous two sections have been obtained using the generating techniques described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 respectively. Other techniques may also be used, both in isolation and in various combinations. Since they involve the same Ernst equation, it is clear that all the solution generating techniques that have been developed for stationary axisymmetric space-times in recent years can also be applied to colliding plane wave situations. A number of papers have recently been published which present new colliding wave solutions using some of these techniques, and it is likely that many more such papers will appear. Most of these concentrate on a description of a particular technique and how it may be adapted to the colliding wave situation. At present, however, there is less emphasis on the physical significance of the particular solution generated. Nevertheless, solutions with a number of parameters have been obtained, and general classes of solutions have been defined. Ideally, one would like to be able to specify the particular solution corresponding to an arbitrary set of initial conditions. Such techniques are available in the axisymmetric case, and may soon be extended to the colliding wave situation. The initial attempts at the solution of this problem are mentioned in the next chapter. So far most of the explicit solutions that have been presented have involved impulsive wave components. In the notation of (7.11), they have used . Much less attention has been given to smooth-fronted waves of finite duration. Some further general aspects of cases involving impulsive components have been clarified by Ferrari (1988). In particular, it has been shown that the proper time between the collision and the subsequent singularity is  inversely proportional to the square root of the amplitudes of the impulsive components of the approaching waves. This time is also affected by their relative polarization and is a minimum when the approaching waves are colinear. This result also applies to solutions which contain a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. In addition, Ferrari has also shown that the shock waves which accompany the impulsive waves only affect the rate at which the Weyl scalars diverge on the singularity. Having made these general remarks, we may now briefly review the new exact solutions that have been presented. The generation techniques themselves will not be described in detail here. First, there is the important class of solutions that has been obtained by Ferrari, Iba\\u00f1ez and Bruni (1987 a , b) using the inverse scattering method developed by Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) and Carr and Verdaguer (1983). Using this method, they have obtained a two-parameter class of colliding wave solutions with non-aligned polarization. This in fact is a generalization of the soliton solution of Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1987 b ) described in Sections 10.4 and 10.5. The Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez-Bruni solution has been obtained using as seed the Kasner metric. They utilize the Belinskii-Zakharov soliton technique with two real poles. The resulting metric for region IV is singular on the space-like surface , except in a particular limiting case. By extending the solution back into regions II and III, it can be seen that the approaching waves must have both an impulsive component and a step component with variable polarization. The limiting case of the Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez-Bruni solution is particularly interesting. It is of type D, and can be shown to be part of the Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region where there are two space-like Killing vectors. The line element can be written in the form  (13.34) where p and q are constants satisfying . It can immediately be seen that, when  and , this further reduces to the two colinear degenerate Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez solutions that have already been considered in Section 10.5. The structure of this solution has been further examined by Ferrari and Iba\\u00f1ez (1988). Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1987 a ) have shown that an Ehlers transformation (12.13) applied to the Ernst function of the Nutku-Halil solution (13.3), together with a simple coordinate transformation, yields a non-colinear generalization of the Ferrari Iba\\u00f1ez soliton solution that was described in Section 10.4 but only with even integer values of the parameter \\u03b1. This generalization is in fact contained in the solution of Ferrari, Iba\\u00f1ez and Bruni (1987 a , b). A further generalization extending the Ferrari-Iba\\u00f1ez-Bruni solution was reported by Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1987 a , b), with a full derivation given in Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1988). This solution contains three arbitrary parameters. In stating this solution, it is convenient first to define the function  (13.35) where a , \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 are the arbitrary parameters, and where . (13.36) With this definition, the Ernst function for this new solution may be written as  (13.37) When , this reduces to the Nutku-Halil solution. With , one obtains the Kerr-NUT solution with \\u03b1 being the NUT parameter. The subcase with  and  becomes the Schwarzschild-NUT space-time. Transforming (13.37) using the Neugebauer Kramer involution produces another three-parameter family of solutions with the alternative Ernst function given by  (13.38) With , this reduces to the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution. Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1987 b ) have also found a simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations relating colliding wave solutions. With this, they have obtained a generalization of the  above solution in the case when . A further generalization of the  solution is also obtained using a Neugebauer-Kramer involution. It was pointed out by Ernst (1986) that the Nutku Halil solution can be derived from the isotropic () Kasner metric by applying a double-Harrison (B\\u00e4cklund) transformation. The Kerr space-time of the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution can also be derived from Minkowski space using a double-Harrison transformation. It therefore seemed reasonable that other colliding wave solutions may be generated by applying double-Harrison transformations to other Kasner metrics. This procedure has indeed been successful. It was used by Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser (1988) to determine the solution described above in (13.35) to (13.38). The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques. Naturally, however, Ernst, Garc\\u00eda-D\\u00edaz and Hauser preferred to use the so-called Hauser-Ernst homogeneous Hilbert problem approach (see also Ernst 1988). Finally, it may be mentioned that Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have recently obtained another particular solution describing the non-colinear case using the generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) as described here in (12.56) and (15.57). Further solutions could easily be obtained using this method. THE INITIAL-VALUE PROBLEM The approach to finding exact solutions that has been taken so far has involved initially solving the field equations in the interaction region IV and then investigating the conditions under which these solutions can be considered as the result of collisions of plane waves. In this way, resulting solutions are found first and the initial conditions are obtained subsequently. In this chapter it is appropriate to return to the original problem of specifying the initial data and then attempting to find the solution that determines the subsequent development. The initial data The problem that is under consideration is the collision of two plane waves in a flat background. It is assumed that the two approaching waves are both known, and it is required to find the exact solution which describes the interaction following the collision. This problem has been formulated in earlier chapters. It has been found convenient to divide space-time into the four regions as illustrated in Figure 3.1. It has also been demonstrated that the metric in the interaction region IV may be taken in the form of the Szekeres line element (6.20) which involves the four functions ,, and  satisfying equations (6.22). One of these equations can be integrated to give . (14.1) In this approach, it is assumed that the initial conditions are determined by the functions  and  which represents the wave in region II as it reaches the boundary , and by  which represents the wave in region III as it reaches the boundary . This is now a typical case of the characteristic initial-value problem. In practice, however, things are a little more complicated since it is normal to make use of the transformation (6.7) to put  in these initial regions. In this case the approaching waves are each described by three functions either of u or of v satisfying a single equation which is either (6.22c) or (6.22b). The difficulty arises because, as described in previous chapters, it is convenient to use f and g , or transformations of them, as coordinates in  the interaction region. Accordingly, it is therefore more convenient to use the transformation (6.7) in the initial regions to put  (14.2) where the constants  and  are essential in order to retain the continuity properties of the functions f and g across the boundaries  and . These constants feature prominently in the junction conditions as described in Section 7.2. They are determined by the character of the wavefronts of the approaching waves. In this case, the data specifying the initial waves is now given by  on , and by  on . In addition, since the function M is essentially determined up to a removable constant for any V and W by equations (6.22b, c), the initial data is effectively described by specifying only the metric functions V and W on the boundaries  and . It is also appropriate to re-express these as functions of f and g . The remaining problem is now to integrate the main field equations to determine the functions V and W in the interaction region subject to their specification on the initial null boundaries. The colinear case For the case when the approaching waves have aligned linear polarization it is possible to put  everywhere, and the main field equation for V may be expressed in terms of different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.11),(10.60) or (10.71). At this point we may take f and g as coordinates and consider the equation in the form (10.2) which may be rewritten as . (14.3) This equation must now be solved for  with initial data defining the approaching waves given by  and . It is also possible to scale the approaching waves such that at the point of collision , and . Equation (14.3) is an Euler-Poisson Darboux equation whose solution may be expressed as a line integral. As originally pointed out in this context by Szekeres (1972) and later repeated by Yurtsever (1988 c ), since (14.3) is a linear hyperbolic equation, it may also be solved explicitly using Riemann's method. According to this method, we consider the adjoint equation  (14,4) where R is a Riemann-Green function satisfying the boundary conditions . (14.5) Figure 14.1 The interaction region IV is represented in f ,g coordinates by the region inside the triangle shown. The sides  and  are the II-IV and III-IV boundaries respectively, and the focusing singularity occurs on the line . The solution for  may be obtained at any point P by integrating round the rectangle PNML. By using Green's theorem the integral of  over the rectangle PNML indicated in Figure 14.1 can be related to its line integral around the boundary. In this way it can be shown that, for any arbitrary point  within the interaction region, the function V is given by  (14.6) provided that R satisfies (14.4) and (14.5) and that . A specific Riemann Green function which satisfies (14.4) and (14.5) is given by  (14.7) where  is the Legendre function of order -\\u00bd. By substituting this and the initial expressions for V on the boundaries ML and MN into (14.6), an explicit integral for V in the interaction region is obtained. This approach of using Riemann's method has been generalized by Xanthopoulos (1986) to include the collision of null fluids coupled with plane gravitational waves. This particular situation will be discussed later in Section 20.2. At this point, we may simply note that the method involved is essentially the same. Although the method described above does give an explicit integral expression for V , in practice it is extremely difficult to evaluate this integral for arbitrary initial data. Thus, it does not really provide a viable method for generating analytic solutions for any given analytic description of the approaching waves. Another problem with the method of Riemann is that it is not practically possible to generalize it to the case for non-colinear collisions. The method only applies to linear hyperbolic equations and, if the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned, the field equations describing the resulting interaction are non-linear. In view of this, Hauser and Ernst (1989 a , b, 1990) have developed an alternative method which can be generalized to the non-colinear situation. The method employed by Hauser and Ernst (1989 a ) is first to find a one-parameter family of basic solutions by means of a suitable separation of variables and then to express the  final solution as a linear super-position of these basic solutions. In fact their approach is based on the solution (10.8), which may be re-expressed in the form  (14.8) for suitable functions  and  which must depend on the initial data. An interesting feature of the method is that the functions  and  are obtained in terms of the prescribed initial data by solving generalized versions of Abel's integral equation for the tautochrone problem of classical particle mechanics. Generalized versions of Abel's integral equation are required because f' (u)and g' (v)are zero on the boundaries  and  respectively. Full details of the method have been described by Hauser and Ernst (1989 a ). However, the techniques are still difficult to use in practice for arbitrary initial data. Hauser and Ernst (1989 b ) have also reformulated the initial-value problem for the colinear case as a Hilbert problem in a complex plane in two different ways. They have presented solutions of both forms of the Hilbert problem and shown that each of these agrees with the solution that is obtained by the method referred to above (Hauser and Ernst, 1989 a ). The non-colinear case Hauser and Ernst (1989 a , b, 1990) have developed the techniques mentioned at the end of the previous section to deal specifically with the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned. The initial data have already been described in Section 14.1. It was also pointed out that, for the colinear case, it was convenient to rescale the approaching waves such that at the point of collision. For the non-colinear case, Hauser and Ernst have found it convenient to work with the complex function Z defined by (11.5) and to use the transformation (12.20) which consists of a rotation and rescaling to put  at the point of collision when  and . For the colinear case the main field equation (14.3) is linear. However, for the non-colinear case this is replaced by two non-linear equations, or by the complex Ernst equation. The non-linearity of this equation introduces considerable difficulty into any attempt at solving the general problem. Hauser and Ernst (1990) have developed a method for considering the initial-value problem for general colliding plane gravitational waves. They have achieved this by replacing the usual initial-value problem in terms of the Ernst equation by an equivalent 2 \\u00d7 2 matrix homogeneous Hilbert problem in the complex plane. In the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is colinear, this approach reduces to the relatively simple one-dimensional Hilbert problem that was previously considered (Hauser and Ernst, 1989 b ). A detailed description of the method developed, however, is beyond the scope of this book and interested readers are directed to the original papers. In spite of these advances, there is strong evidence that the general solution of the initial-value problem for the non-colinear case is not expressible in a finite closed form. In addition, practical methods for solving the matrix homogeneous Hilbert problem for particular non-colinear cases still need to be developed. Clearly this is an area where considerable further work is required. COLLIDING ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES: THE BELL-SZEKERES SOLUTION In an important paper, Bell and Szekeres (1974) gave an exact solution which describes the collision and subsequent interaction of two electromagnetic plane waves. This solution, which appears to be remarkably simple, will be described in this chapter. Other exact solutions describing colliding electromagnetic waves will be described in Chapters 16 and 17, after more powerful techniques have been developed. The Bell-Szekeres solution Bell and Szekeres have considered a very simple situation involving a collision of two step electromagnetic waves. Prior to the collision, the waves may be described by the familiar line element (4.15). In regions I and II, this takes the form  (15.1) and the step wave is given by . The opposing wave with  may be described in an identical way with the null coordinate u replaced by v , and a different space-like coordinate replacing r . The two electromagnetic field components in the initial regions I, II and III are taken to be . (15.2) The fact that both of these expressions are real simultaneously indicates that the polarization of the two electromagnetic waves is aligned. In addition, they have identical step profiles. The relative amplitudes a and b may, of course, both be equated to unity when convenient. The components of the Weyl tensor are initially all zero. By this stage, we are familiar with the fact that it is appropriate to transform the metrics in all regions into Rosen form. Accordingly, the line elements in the initial regions may be taken in the forms of (4.19) and (4.20), namely  (15.3) The initial-value problem is now well set, and it remains to find the unique solution in the interaction region. The field equations for colliding electromagnetic waves have already been obtained in Chapter 6. In terms of the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the gravitational field equations for the interaction region take the form (6.22), and Maxwell's equations are given by (6.21). The appropriate boundary conditions for this situation have been described in Chapter 7. As usual, it may be noted that (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give  (15 4) where f and g are arbitrary decreasing functions in the interaction region. From the junction conditions it can be seen that, in this case, these functions necessarily take the forms:. (15.5) The solution of the complete set of equations (6.21,22) given by Bell and Szekeres is . (15.6) It can be seen that these functions satisfy the required O'Brien-Synge boundary conditions. Thus the line element in the interaction region IV is . (15.7) This line element is in fact one form of the Bertotti-Robinson solution (Bertotti 1959, Robinson 1959), which is known to be conformally flat. The coordinate transformation  (15.8) transforms the line element (15.7) into the more familiar form . (15 9) Halilsoy (1987) has considered an application of the transformation  to the above solution. However, this does not lead to any new results that are of physical significance. The structure of the solution The above solution describes the collision of two step electromagnetic waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. This follows from the fact that  is real, and . As has been pointed out above, the solution inside the interaction region IV is conformally flat. However, as Bell and Szekeres have shown, there are necessarily discontinuities in the derivatives of the metric function V across the initial boundaries of this region. These manifest themselves as the impulsive gravitational waves  (15.10) which may be considered to be generated by the collision. It is in fact a general feature of colliding electromagnetic plane waves that gravitational waves are always generated by the collision. This can easily be demonstrated by considering the field equations (6.22d, e). In the interaction region, and  are necessarily both non-zero. It follows that V and W can not both remain constant. Thus, the congruences tangent to both waves must begin to shear, and it can be seen from (6.23) that the components of the Weyl tensor  and , and possibly  will necessarily appear. In this case, the discontinuity in the electromagnetic components causes impulsive gravitational waves to be generated. It can also be shown that smooth-fronted electromagnetic waves would generate smooth-fronted or step gravitational waves that  would persist through the interaction region. It may also be observed from (15.10) that difficulties occur at the points . At first sight, it would appear that curvature singularities occur at these points (Matzner and Tipler, 1984). However, curvature tensors of this type can be interpreted as distributions (see Geroch and Traschen, 1987) and, in this case, the standard definition of a curvature singularity in terms of unboundedness in a  parallelly propagated frame is inapplicable. The global structure of this solution has been analysed in detail by Clarke and Hayward (1989). They have confirmed that, in regions II and III, the surfaces on which  and  respectively behave as \\u2018fold\\u2019 singularities similar to those of the Khan-Penrose solution described in Section 8.2. Initially, the most surprising feature of the Bell-Szekeres solution was that a space-like curvature singularity does not occur in region IV. In this case, the surface on which , which is here given by , turns out to be merely a coordinate singularity since the curvature tensor is clearly bounded. Bell and Szekeres have demonstrated how this singularity can be removed by considering the following coordinate transformation:(15.11) where . With this, the line element (15.6) becomes  (15.12) which is clearly regular when . In order to retain the one-to-one correspondence, it is appropriate initially to restrict the Bell-Szekeres coordinate x to the range . The coordinates X and Y are restricted by , where the boundary  contains the space-like plane on which the collision occurs. It has been shown by Clarke and Hayward (1989) that region IV is part of a space-time that is regular apart from two covering-space singularities that occur when . These are points on the boundary of region IV where it joins with the limits of regions II and III. At these points, which are on the polar axis  and  in the Bertotti-Robinson form of the metric (15.9),. With the above transformation, each interval of the coordinate x of length 2 \\u03c0/; c corresponds to a circular region in the X ,Y plane with the origin removed and cut along the line . Neighbouring regions of x are joined together along these cuts to form a surface which continuously winds around the origin. The origin of the X ,Y plane thus corresponds to a singularity of a quasiregular covering-space type. It is also sometimes convenient (Clarke and Hayward, 1989) to make the further coordinate transformation  (15.13) With this, the line element (15.12) takes the alternative form of the Bertotti-Robinson line element  (15.14) Region IV is now described by the line element (15.14) with the coordinate ranges given by  (15.15) This is joined to regions II and III across the surfaces . (15.16) Clarke and Hayward (1989) have also shown that the Bell-Szekeres solution is extendable to the future through the surface , but the extension is not unique because of the presence of the singularities. They have further suggested two possible extensions which will be described in the next section. It is also somewhat remarkable that the global structure of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as described by Clarke and Hayward (1989), is very similar to that of the collision of an impulsive gravitational wave with a null shell of matter, as described by Babala (1987). This will be discussed in Section 19.3. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have conducted a thorough perturbation analysis of this particular solution. Throughout the interaction region subsequent to the collision they have obtained a complete set  of bounded normal modes that are expressed in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. These modes exhibit a behaviour of ever-increasing frequency as the Cauchy horizon is approached. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have also considered perturbations in the initial regions which contain the approaching waves. For the approaching wave in region II which propagates along the null line ,, they have shown that v -independent perturbations are not permitted to all orders, while all the v -dependent perturbations exhibit strong divergences along the \\u2018fold\\u2019 singularity. Unfortunately, these perturbations can not be joined continuously to those of the interaction region. It is therefore not possible to consider the effects of these perturbations subsequent to the collision. Extensions of the solution In the Bell-Szekeres solution, it has been shown that the hypersurface  on which the opposing waves mutually focus each other is a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. It is therefore appropriate to consider possible extensions to this solution through the horizon, even though any such extension will not be unique. Two possible extensions have been given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). One natural extension of region IV is simply the future extension of the region as described by the line element (15.14). This is achieved by extending the coordinate range to  (15.17) where . In this extension, the waves cross and focus. The subsequent space-time is unchanging. Another equally natural extension of region IV is obtained by noting that the line element (15.14) admits a reflection symmetry  about the hyperplane  (or  about ). Thus, there is an extension in which region IV is extended as far as  and is then followed by the time reverse of the entire solution. In this extension, the waves cross, mutually focus each other, re-expand and then separate leaving Minkowski space between them to the future. This situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1 in terms of the original null coordinates and the line elements (15.3) and (15.7). Other apparent extensions of the Bell-Szekeres solution have been suggested by G\\u00fcrses and Halilsoy (1982) in which the approaching electromagnetic waves consist of a sequence of steps. The step lengths, however, have to be double the distance to the fold singularities. Thus, these  solutions necessarily extend the space-time through the covering space singularities and can not, therefore, be considered as appropriate solutions for colliding plane waves. In all these solutions the space-time can only be extended uniquely up to the fold singularities in regions II and III and the surface in region IV on which . It must therefore be concluded that the G\\u00fcrses-Halilsoy extensions are not physically significant. Figure 15.1 An extension of the Bell-Szekeres space-time. Regions marked I are flat. Regions marked II and III contain electromagnetic waves with , and  respectively, having metrics given by (15.3). There are impulsive gravitational waves along the boundaries of region IV, which has metric (15.7). A non-colinear collision In the Bell-Szekeres solution, the polarization of the approaching electromagnetic waves is aligned. It is appropriate now to consider how this solution may be generalized to include the case when the polarization is not aligned. In the approaching waves a rotation of the polarization is expressed by a rotation of the components \\u03a6 2 or \\u03a6 in the complex plane. The metrics in both regions are unaltered, since a null electromagnetic field  is defined by the metric only up to a constant duality rotation. Thus, to extend the Bell-Szekeres solution, the same initial conditions are given except that the component  becomes complex and, from (6.22e),W must become non-zero in the interaction region. A solution presented by Griffiths (1985) satisfying this condition may be written in the form  (15.18) where  (15.19) The relative polarization angle of the two waves prior to the collision is given by \\u03b1. It may be noticed that the expression for U here is equivalent to those of (15.4,5) and (15.6). The common multiple 2 has been inserted so that this solution can be more directly related to the Bell-Szekeres solution to which it reduces when . It can be shown that this solution has exactly the same properties as the aligned Bell-Szekeres solution. It is conformally flat everywhere except at the boundaries of the interaction region where there are impulsive gravitational waves that may be considered to be generated by the collision. These are given by  (15.20) According to a theorem of Tariq and Tupper (1974), this new solution must as be the Bertotti-Robinson space-time in a different coordinate system. In fact it can be obtained from the Bell-Szekeres line element (15.7) by the simple rotation  (15.21) Thus, the gravitational field in this case is identical to that of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as may have been expected. In the collision of plane  electromagnetic waves with non-aligned polarization, it must therefore be concluded that the dynamics remains unaltered. It is only the form of the metric in the interaction region that needs to be modified to that given in this section.\",\n          \"Bankruptcy \\u2014 Jurisdiction \\u2014 Carrying on business \\u2014 Debtor selling business and leaving United Kingdom more than three years before presentation of petition \\u2014 No debts outstanding save for income tax liability \\u2014 Whether debtor \\u2018carried on business\\u2019 within three years preceding petition \\u2014 Jurisdiction to make bankruptcy order \\u2014 Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45), s. 265(1) (c)(ii) In May 1987 the debtor, who had carried on the business of running a nursing home, sold the business as a going concern and went to live in the Canary Islands.

Sarflax Ltd., In re [1979]Ch. 592;[1979]2 W.L.R. 202;[1979]1 All E.R. 529 APPEAL from the registrar in bankruptcy. On 11 November 1991, Mr. Registrar Pimm, pursuant to a petition presented on 1 February 1991, made a bankruptcy order against the debtor, although the debtor had not lived in England and Wales since 8 May 1987, on the basis that she was still notionally carrying on business in England and Wales within the meaning of section 265(1) (c ) of the Insolvency Act 1986 because though there were no other debts outstanding there was an unpaid tax liability of over \\u00a3500,000. By a notice of appeal dated 29 November 1991 the debtor appealed on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order because she had not carried on business in England or Wales within three years prior to the presentation of the petition. The facts are stated in the judgment. Richard Ritchie for the debtor. Nicholas Warren for the Inland Revenue Commissioners. HOFFMANN J. This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Registrar Pimm, which raises a question on the court's jurisdiction to make a bankruptcy order. The debtor in this case carried on business in this country running a nursing home in the course of which she incurred a tax liability in the sum of about \\u00a3500,000 which remains unpaid. In January 1987 she went to live in Tenerife and on 8 May 1987 she sold the business as a going concern. There is no evidence that any debts, apart from her tax liability, remained outstanding. In 1988 she made an offer to settle the tax liability, which was not accepted, and on 1 February 1991 the Inland Revenue Commissioners presented a bankruptcy petition which came before the registrar on 11 November 1991. The sole question before him was whether there was jurisdiction under section 265 of the Insolvency Act 1986. That section sets out various grounds for jurisdiction, including the domicile, residence and physical presence of the debtor in England, but the sole ground relied on in this case is section 265(1) (c )(ii), namely, that the debtor within a period of three years ending on the date of presentation, had \\u2018carried on business in England and Wales.\\u2019 The debtor says that she has not carried on business in this country since 8 May 1987, the date upon which the business was sold. The Inland Revenue say that carrying on business for the purposes of this section continues until all the debts of the business incurred in the course of trade have been paid, and that includes the liability for tax. The construction which is put forward by the Commissioners is one which was adopted by the courts in respect of section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, upon which section 265 of the Act of 1986 is plainly modelled. Section 4(1) (d ) of the Act of 1914 also contained various grounds of jurisdiction, including when the debtor, \\u2018has carried on business in England, personally or by means of an agent or manager\\u2019 within a year before the presentation of the petition. The only noticeable change in the language in the Act of 1986 is the extension of that period to three years. Section 4(1) (d ) was considered by the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186. The facts of that case were not materially different from this one. There too the only debt remaining outstanding from a business which had otherwise ceased more than a year before was a debt owed to the Inland Revenue. Lord Porter, who delivered the only speech, referred to a number of earlier cases dealing with the construction of \\u2018carrying on a business\\u2019 for the purposes of jurisdiction over the separate property of married women. The relevant statute in those cases had provided simply that jurisdiction should exist over a married woman \\u2018carrying on a trade separately from her husband.\\u2019 The question which arose in those cases was whether the cessation of trade, in the sense of \\u2018putting the shutters up,\\u2019 immediately deprived the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction over the married woman, or whether it continued while the trade debts remained unpaid. It will be observed that in those cases there was no statutory period after cessation of trade during which jurisdiction continued, and the court was therefore faced with a stark choice between saying that the jurisdiction ceased immediately active trade was suspended, or saying that it continued until the business had actually been wound up by payment of the debts. There was no basis upon which any intermediate position could be chosen. It is not in those circumstances surprising that the court decided in favour of the latter construction. In Theophile's case, however, the choice was not nearly so stark. There would have been less practical difficulty about saying that trade ceased when business ceased actively to be carried on, because there was a further period of a year during which a petition could be presented. Nonetheless, the House of Lords applied the same construction. The question before me today is whether Parliament, in using similar language in section 265, intended those words to bear the same meaning as those given to them by the House of Lords under the Act of 1914. The Insolvency Act 1986 is a consolidation Act only in the sense that it consolidates the Insolvency Act 1985 and some other provisions. It is an entirely new code in relation to the Bankruptcy Act 1914. The court therefore has to approach its construction on the footing that the new Act may exhibit policies and intentions which are not necessarily the same as those in the earlier Act, and which require similar words to be given different meanings from those which the courts gave them under the earlier legislation. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)[1989]1 W.L.R. 271, the Court of Appeal was concerned with the construction of a provision in the Insolvency Rules 1986 (S.I. 1986 No. 1925), rule 7.55, which provided: \\u2018No insolvency proceedings shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which objection is made considers that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity, and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of the court. Under a similar provision in the Bankruptcy Act 1914 it had been held that a defect in a bankruptcy notice of a kind such as could reasonably mislead the debtor was not a mere formal defect or irregularity within the meaning of that provision, and therefore rendered the notice a nullity even though it was not calculated to cause substantial injustice. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)the Court of Appeal refused to follow that approach and held that a statutory demand, which on the face of it contained a number of puzzling and perplexing statements, was nonetheless valid because the debtor knew precisely what he owed and there was no injustice in holding that his failure to pay the debt gave rise to a presumption that he was unable to pay. That approach to construction was approved by the House of Lords in In re Smith (A Bankrupt), Ex parte Braintree District Council [1990]2 A.C. 215, in which Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said, at p. 238, that, in view of the changes in policy shown by the new Act, he felt justified in construing the provision of the Act of 1986 \\u2018as a piece of new legislation without regard to 19th century authorities or similar provisions of repealed Bankruptcy Acts.\\u2019 Those authorities show that, in approaching the language of the Act of 1986, one must pay particular attention to the purposes and policies of its own provisions and be wary of simply carrying over uncritically meanings which had been given to similar words in the earlier Act. It does not, however, mean that the language of the new Act comes to one entirely free of any of the intellectual freight which was carried by words and phrases in earlier bankruptcy or other legislation. Decisions of the court upon the meanings of phrases used in Acts of Parliament may come, in the course of time, to give them the quality of terms of art which Parliament may well be assumed to have intended them to bring with them when used in subsequent legislation. In section 265, for example, terms such as \\u2018domiciled,\\u2019\\u2018personally present,\\u2019\\u2018ordinarily resident,\\u2019 have had attributed to them, both in the context of bankruptcy and in that of civil procedure generally, a wealth of refined construction which it is difficult to suppose Parliament did not intend equally to apply when those words were used in the Act of 1986. Is there any reason why that should not apply equally to the words \\u2018has carried on business?\\u2019 There does not seem to me to be anything in the policy of the new Act which suggests that in this provision Parliament was intending to give those words a different meaning from those which they had been held to bear under the Act of 1914. It was suggested that the extension of the period to three years from one required the attribution of a different meaning because the Theophile construction meant that it did not really matter what the period was; as long as there was a debt, a bankruptcy petition could be presented. The effect of the outstanding debt would be to prevent the cessation of trade for the purposes of the section. That is not quite true, because the debt must, in order to found jurisdiction under section 265, be a trade debt. For the purposes simply of enabling the petitioner to rank as a creditor, the debt can, of course, be any kind of debt. It follows that the extension to three years does have significance. It enables a non-trade creditor to present a petition within three years after the last trade debt has been paid instead of within only one year. In Muir Hunter on Personal Insolvency (1991), p. 3037, at para. 3\\u2013070, it is suggested that the Theophile construction of the Act of 1914 is a somewhat artificial one, and the question is raised as to whether, under the new Act, unfettered by old case law, the long established but artificial construction will continue to be applied. It appears to me, however, that the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186 did not regard their construction as being an artificial one. They came to that conclusion on the grounds that it appeared to them to be a tenable meaning of the words and in accordance with what they thought to be the policy of the Act of 1914 as to jurisdiction. I have already said that, on the question of jurisdiction, I can discern no difference between the policy of the Act of 1914 and that of the Act of 1986, and under those circumstances I think that the registrar's decision was right and the appeal must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed with costs. Leave to appeal.

Nevertheless people are always involved, the designer himself is a human being and his product will shape the behaviour of many workers and other users. More fundamentally, the design activity will be meaningless unless it is directed towards serving some human need. In spite of all this, the design process itself is often thought about and executed without any formal considerations about people. Inevitably the engineer, architect or other designer devotes most of his attention and expertise to devising mechanisms, buildings and so on which support some human activity more effectively than those currently available. The new machine or system must not be very different from the old one for a variety of reasons. The old one did its job, not perfectly but well enough to justify its existence. The new one is usually designed on the basis of copying the old one but removing as many as possible of the faults. There are other reasons such as commonality of components and, of course, shortage of imagination which lead to most design and development being a progressive iterative process. This happens to suit the human operators because most of their skills will transfer along the line of development of the machines and systems. From the engineering point of view the hardware technology is central and the operators tag along supporting the activity of machines which are basically doing the work. In nineteenth century transport for example, the coach and horses was not a serious competitor for the steam-engined train, nor was the man with a spade as productive as the operator with a steam shovel. This was the earliest technology in which power was derived from sources other than animal muscles and the output was so obviously superior that men did not mind putting up with the inconvenience of machines which were uncomfortable or awkward to use. They even took pride in developing new skills which enabled them to use difficult machines which inexperienced people could not  use. This attitude was reinforced by the second wave of technology which provided instrumentation, ways of sensing and recording data which gave more accurate and reliable data than that which can be detected directly by the human senses. At this stage the typical machine operator manipulated machine controls on the basis of data presented on instruments. The machine controls caused power to be applied and consequences to occur which resulted in changed readings on the instruments. The man was in the control loop (Hick and Bates, 1950). More recently, in the third wave of technology the man has been removed from the responsibility for continuous control (this is best done by computers working to a moderately flexible range of programs) but he remains as the monitor of the system performance and a selector of the appropriate program determined by the changing short-term objectives. He may keep the responsibility for setting-up and shutting-down the system or this also may be partially delegated to computers. This is the \\u2018Supervisory Control\\u2019 role (Sheridan and Johannsen, 1976). Information flow in these three phases of development of system control is shown in fig. 1.1 Supervisory control is by no means universal, in fact it remains restricted to high technology systems such as aircraft, computer controlled machine tools, chemical plants and power stations. (Edwards and Lees, 1974). There are still many systems where the man is in the control loop, for example in vehicle driving and in most manufacturing production processes. There are many tasks where the operator is assisted only by hand-tools and simple powered machines, for example in craft-work and surgery. There are also plenty of tasks, although these are now perhaps more common in leisure than in paid work, where the man supplies the muscle power, for example the manual labourer and the active sportsman. In general, the working man may function at any level from the senior partner in high technology operations to the provider of muscle power in physically demanding jobs. In all cases the ergonomic requirement is that the task as designed should make use of his abilities and be adaptive to his limitations. The human contribution in high technology systems All working systems, including those incorporating advanced technology of processes and process control, depend on skilled operators. There are social, economic and technical reasons for this. Socially the public will not easily accept automatic systems. When seeking reassurance that a system is safe they study the people who are responsible for it. They have no means of assessing the reliability of automatic control systems but they can make some assessment of a skilled individual and without  knowing very much about his working procedures they will trust his actions if he seems calm, competent and mature. The most direct example is the nervous airline passenger who is comforted by the belief that the middle-aged pilot he saw sitting on the flight deck is flying the aeroplane. Less directly but equally importantly, people living in the vicinity of a large plant would not take kindly to the idea that it was not under the control of human beings who are on the spot and are assumed to know exactly what is happening. Economically it remains true that it is inordinately expensive to construct a system which must continue to be reliable without direct human intervention, for example under the sea or in space. Equally it is expensive to ensure that equipment will continue to function under rough handling conditions, for example the necessary \\u2018ruggedising\\u2019 of military equipment. A system can be designed much more economically if it can be assumed that skilled personnel are available to control and take care of it. Technically the state of the art seems to be that systems are most efficient, reliable and safe when control is largely automatic but the human operator remains in a monitoring and supervisory role. That is, continuous dynamic dealing with minor perturbations is automatic and so also is the application of basic rules about safety; for example , the system or some part of it might be programmed to go through a step-change function such as a shut-down if certain parameters exceed prescribed limits. The role of the human operator in these circumstances is largely specified by operating instructions which are mandatory. Given this and this \\u2014 he must do that. Characteristically his intervention in this way is a response to some other human requirement; for example, a maintenance man may wish to have a particular sub-system shut down for his attention or a user of the system product may wish to receive a different input to meet his purposes. Many of these interactions could be made automatic were it not for the basic need for a human presence for the social/ economic reasons mentioned above and because the human operator has to act as the ultimate back-stop when things go badly wrong. Things go badly wrong when there has been some extreme untoward event such as a fire, an earthquake or a bomb, alternatively an unanticipated combination of faults may occur within the plant itself. In either case the human intervention must be a very high level one based on complex diagnosis and innovative design-type thinking about how best to cope so as to avoid a catastrophe. A catastrophe can happen when the system energy is no longer channelled as intended by the designers or because there is a release of toxic substances or both. The demands on the operator stem from two kinds of task which are not compatible because they require very different levels of skill. On the one hand he must cope with routines where the demand is for precise obedience to  established instructions and on the other hand he might suddenly be faced with a need to respond in a creative manner totally outside any instructions. Superficially the solution would seem to be to have two kinds of operators, those who carry out the routines and others who are on call should unforeseen emergencies arise. There are two snags about this approach. Firstly there may not be time or it may not be physically possible to suddenly introduce a high level operator, for example we cannot put a different pilot on the flight deck when an aircraft gets into trouble. Secondly, the high level operator will not maintain his skill and familiarity with the system unless he operates regularly within it. His ability to intervene effectively must be a function of his \\u2018hands on\\u2019 experience supported of course by his conceptual knowledge of how the system functions. This last proposition is based on experience of systems where the intervention requires complex manipulative activity, for example a surgeon dealing with an emergency during an operation or an aircraft pilot taking over manually. It is not so obviously true where the intervention takes the form essentially of a decision to initiate a single direct action such as closing a particular valve or starting up a stand-by pump. In these circumstances it is not clear whether or not the effectiveness of the intervention is quite so dependent on operating experience. Taking for example the nuclear power plant control room, the question is whether the desk operators should be expected to cope with all emergencies which appear within the total information presentation or whether, for complex and dangerous situations, a more senior person such as the shift-charge engineer should be called upon to make the decisions. This policy issue must be cleared before the basic personnel decisions about selection and training of staff at the various levels can be made and before the information presentations can be designed. The human contribution in low technology systems The extreme case of man as a source of muscle power is dealt with in the previous book in this series \\u2014The Body at Work . Such working situations are now relatively rare in developed countries and the man is more usually employed in tasks where there is a considerable control element requiring extensive information processing. Such tasks range from the use of simple hand tools to tracking using complex powered machinery. Human beings are needed for those tasks for a variety of reasons from their highly dexterous manipulative potential through to their ability to accept informal instructions. These reasons are given in detail in the discussion of man-machine function allocation (p. 35). The demands on the human operator are difficult to quantify or even to describe because the process is essentially an interactive one. The skilled operator is working in harmony with his tools and machines. The concept of \\u2018demand\\u2019 is often not appropriate because it implies confrontation, the process is more aptly considered as one of cooperation and persuasion. The human operator is pursuing an objective, usually to make something or to go somewhere, and he achieves this with the assistance of the hardware at his disposal. This hardware, if it is well-designed, aids him in his progress toward his objective. There may be demands in the sense that there are always obstacles to be overcome but these stem from the nature and the variability of the situation he is in; that is, the materials he has to deal with or the environment he has to move through. The skilled operator will aim for efficient performance. Efficiency incorporates not only quantity and quality of achievement but also preservation of his own safety and health and that of others who might be involved as working partners, passengers or the general public in the neighbourhood. Of course, if his tasks are badly designed they may well make unnecessary demands. These begin with bodily aspects of the operating posture required and the forces which must be exerted to operate controls. for a work-space which is used full-time very slight departures from the optimum may lead to problems in the long term, for example in strained ligaments, tendons and muscles. Posture is constrained not only by the physical dimensions of the work-space but also by the need to be in a position to see certain events and to feel others through control operations or machine movement. Other demands will arise if the information presented is inadequate in content, e.g. poor lighting may make it difficult to detect some relevant cues, or in structure, e.g. because of poor coding and presentation of information on dials, charts or screens. Correspondingly there may be output demands created by control operations which result in things happening too quickly or unexpectedly. The level of demand is to do not only with the tasks as they are done but also with the duration for which they must continue to be done. This applies particularly to routines and repetitive work where the main operator limitation is not capacity or skill but stamina. In principle, repetitive work is best left to automatic machines but the flexibility of human performance is often needed because slight changes are required either to modify the product or to cope with different materials. Batch production work is often of this kind and in general it is by no means as unchanging or boring as it might appear to the casual visitor to the factory. In all the clothing trades for example there are continuous changes in sizes, materials, colours, styles and so on which provide the appropriate variety for  the customers and incidentally for the producer. Work design must take account of the needs of the consumer as well as those of the worker. Ergonomics and other aspects of technology The technical specialist who represents the people point of view implicit in the approach just described is the ergonomist. In the previous book in this series the relationship of ergonomics to other aspects or kinds of technology was discussed in detail. The unique feature of ergonomics is its emphasis on the characteristics of human operators and their relevance to the design of work. The role of the ergonomist is essentially an advisory one. In the case of high technology design he must provide a service for the engineers and scientists who carry the technical design responsibility. This service may simply be as a source of information or the ergonomist can have more power in that the design decisions involving people have to be approved by him. This is usually restricted to obvious cases of man-machine interaction such as the design of displays, controls and work-spaces. In the case of low technology design again he has an advisory role but with a general emphasis on awareness of the kinds and ranges of people who are being catered for. for systems which are already operating the ergonomist is likely to cooperate with occupational health and safety specialists and to play a part in the consideration of accidents and occupational diseases which might arise from unnecessarily stressful work situations (p. 294). It will be appreciated that for most kinds of work and most working organisations it is not feasible to employ specialist ergonomists. In such cases those who have responsibilities for work design need to have some awareness of the principles of ergonomics. The philosophy of work Ergonomics is sometimes confused by questions such as, who is the ergonomist servicing \\u2014 the employer or the worker? or, to whom is he ultimately responsible \\u2014 the state, the employer, the producer or the consumer? fortunately it is possible to dispose of these issues without taking up any particular political position. Ergonomics seems to flourish equally well in capitalist and socialist/communist systems, ergonomics activity can be sponsored with equal validity by employers organisations and by workers organisations. This is because, as already mentioned, ergonomics is about efficient use of people. There can be no good reason to object to this when it is recognised that efficiency incorporates personal factors such as safety, health and quality of  working life as well as system factors such as productivity and quality of work. There is rarely any conflict in that good ergonomics is in line with the objectives of the worker, the employer and the consumer or customer. There are sometimes larger issues of whether what the system does is acceptable or not, for example in weapon systems, and the ergonomist as a citizen will have his own opinion on these matters but the ergonomist as an ergonomist is confined to questions of efficiency. There is an underlying necessary ethic which is best summarised as the social contract. An individual is a member of a community from which he obtains considerable benefits, in return he develops special skills which he applies for the benefit of the community. The application of special skills in this way is called work. The ergonomist has to believe that work is a good thing and that to conduct it efficiently is always better than to conduct it inefficiently. The design of systems. The system concept A system is a set of interacting parts which has meaning as a whole because it is possible to define a purpose \\u2014 a reason why the parts are seen to be related to the whole and a justification for the concept of the whole (Singleton, 1974). Thus, systems theory is essentially teleological \\u2014 explanations are in terms of consequences rather than causes. The parts may themselves be complex and may be conceived as having their own subsidiary purposes in confluence with the system purpose, these are sub-systems. The system in turn is part of a larger complex \\u2014 the parent system. Thus, systems are hierarchical and at each level the unit is considered as a functional rather than a physical entity. The systems approach is often a convenient way of looking at human behaviour either internally \\u2014 this is man as a set of sub-systems or in terms of the man interacting with mechanisms \\u2014 man-machine systems, or man interacting with organisations \\u2014 socio-technical systems. The enormous flexibility of the systems approach has its penalties in potential confusion due to the highly variable relationship between functional and physical entities. Sometimes this relationship is fairly close; for example, in the nervous system, the endocrine system, the digestive system and so on , and sometimes it remains almost entirely unknown, for example , the perceptual system and the decision-making system. These last two are obviously each related to the nervous system and to the brain but not necessarily to a particular part of the brain and taken together they overlap in such obscure ways that they are best regarded as sub-systems in different domains, one can talk in terms of one or the other but not both simultaneously. Systems theory is a useful way of identifying complex entities, particularly  those which have a functional unity and of talking about relationships but it remains at some level of abstraction from reality. for example, to solve any design problem there has at some stage to be a switch from systems thinking to thinking in terms of physical entities because these are the things that can be created, precisely located and manipulated in the real world. Nevertheless, there are enormous dividends in being able to discuss functions independently of physical mechanisms and to explain relationships without being restricted to established and readily observable physical connections or separations. For example, thinking of a power station as a way of translating energy from fuel into electric power enables the designer to consider various options. Should the fuel be of a fossil type such as coal or oil or should it be the radioactive elements in a nuclear reaction? When the heat has appeared how best should it be taken away \\u2014 by pressurised water, by steam, by liquid sodium or by carbon dioxide? This heat has to be turned into mechanical energy, currently always by a steam turbine and the mechanical energy in a rotating shaft is then translated by a generator into electricity. The losses in this transfer of energy from one form to another can be calculated and the flow through the various sub-systems can be traced. The initial consideration of the power station as an energy processing system aids design discussions about the relative advantages and limitations of various mechanisms and their performance in practice. As the system operates it has to be controlled. The control of the flow of energy is partly through automatic servomechanisms and partly through human operations. The design problem of which does what is also best thought about initially in system terms. Distinct from the flow of energy the designer is, at this stage, thinking about the flow of information. Energy and information are processed by systems and sub-systems. In these terms, the human operator is a particular sub-system. Mechanical devices and human operators are not comparable physically beyond the mundane level of size but they are comparable as different sub-systems whose performance can be described and assessed in terms of the common metrics of energy and information. Hence the importance of systems concepts to ergonomics. If the human operator is to control functions within other sub-systems he must receive information about the system state through a man-machine interface. This interface takes its physical form in the control room. The control room is part of the communications channel between the human operators and the mechanisms and its design, as a man-machine interface, is one of the key ergonomics problems in power stations. Office organisations also can be considered as systems. There will be certain physical mechanisms such as telephones, typewriters and computers but the flow of energy is trivial and the interest centres entirely on the flow of  information. Consider, for example, a travel office. There is a vast amount of information available either in printed form or through computer networks. The objectives are to help members of the public to find their way through this information store and to transmit their orders for particular journeys or holidays to the providers of those services. The manager or designer of the office has to consider the various sub-systems he requires; one for dealing with enquiries, one for handling money, one for receiving new information, one for confirming orders and so on. The interface between the public and the information store is a counter manned by people. The counter assistants are parts of the interface. Information is exchanged verbally and through written documentation. In this kind of office the variety of requests for service is probably such that it would be necessary to provide a set of categories of the main kinds of activities or functions. It would then be possible to devise the appropriate system for presenting the required information. It is a very different situation from a power station control room but nevertheless the same principles of starting by the analysis of the required information apply. The power station, the travel office and all other man-made systems have in common the employment of people so that sub-systems are required which are associated with personnel functions. It is necessary to attract and select staff, to train them, to provide them with various services and with potentiality for advancement as their skills increase with experience. The design of tasks is the common ground between personnel activities such as training and engineering activities such as workplace design. Consideration of people in system terms provides the possibility of generalisations which apply across great varieties of physical and intellectual activities. The resulting knowledge is the content of ergonomics. Fig. 1.2 shows the outline of the systems design process in a way which emphasises the parallel roles of the engineer and the ergonomist concerned respectively with the design of the hardware and the personnel sub-systems and their common design problems of allocation of function and interface design. The design of high technology systems The insertion of an adequate Human factors approach into a comprehensive design process is not easy, partly for the reason mentioned already that it has not habitually been regarded as necessary and partly because it cuts across all other decision-making. The Human Factors specialist can rightly be accused of wanting to have a finger in every pie because, as he sees it, behavioural considerations do affect every design decision. If ergonomics was confined to, say, the determination of the physical dimensions of the work-space then it would be more readily accepted by traditional designers, but the  broad claim that ergonomics has a contribution to make to every design and operational aspect which involves the behaviour of people is a proposition which it is much more difficult for an engineer or other designer to digest (fig. 1.3). The questions begin with the formulation of the design objectives. What are   the human requirements which the new product or process is intended to meet and how far are they not met by those already available? This would normally be regarded as a matter for economists and market-research specialists but behind the formidable array of evidence which they will generate are more fundamental questions of consumer preference, customer requirements and so on which are matters of human needs and prejudices. Competent market research should cover these aspects but the ergonomist can remind the policy-makers that such evidence is needed and that it should be acquired by studies of people which are properly conducted. If the evidence is favourable then the next step will be to set up a design team containing members covering the relevant range of expertise. How much design effort is needed in the different areas will not be clear at this stage but unless the system is very simple there are bound to be problems of overlap and of how far to arrange sub-teams by discipline, by function or by problem (Singleton, 1987). The usual compromise is that there should be problem-orientated sub-teams but with additional support available from discipline-orientated specialists. If these latter are part of the design team then already we have a matrix organisation but they may well be provided on a service basis from some other part of the parent organisation. Difficulties will emerge later unless considerable thought is given at this stage to the appropriate range of skills required and the consequent problems of interdisciplinary communication. The art of good sub-system design is to identify problem areas where work can proceed relatively independently of other areas so that the need for intercommunication is minimised. There will always be the need for some intercommunication and the appropriate interfaces should be provided. Nevertheless, if committees, working parties and task forces begin to proliferate within the design team, this is a sure indication that the basic allocation into sub-systems was not optimal. Communication should be mainly through the central command and control centre which may be no larger than the project leader and his small personal staff as may be a group of heads of sub-systems or both. These issues are discussed from another viewpoint in Chapter 3 (p. 140). The analysis of required skills ought in principle to have an ergonomics input but in practice it is usually done on the basis of experience of similar system designs in the past. There can be a useful discussion between the project leader and an ergonomist where the former is invited to clarify how he sees these intercommunication problems being dealt with including such criteria as what is reported to him, what to the meeting of sub-heads and what occurs directly between sub-teams. Organisational rules of this kind can be very helpful in steering between the excessive information flow, e.g. memoranda copied to many people, and excessive unilateralism, e.g. refusing further discussion after the issue of formal documents. Having allocated the human and other resources needed for the overall design task it is then appropriate to develop a more detailed model of the system functions in terms of materials, energy and information flow. Most designers have an intuitive but unformalised picture in these terms but it is of great utility to produce these pictures in flow diagram form so that any differences of view are revealed and can be reconciled by discussions during the process of agreeing the diagrams. When there are a number of individuals or groups from different disciplines and pursuing different objectives within some overall specification it is  obviously crucial that all their activities should be in line with the common goal. To this end, it is necessary that there should be intercommunication not only about particular design decisions but also about underlying philosophies so that the ultimate system is conceptually as well as operationally coherent. Sometimes this is achieved by a dominant project leader who imposes his own philosophy and then makes many of the decisions leaving only detailing for team members. In recent times it is more usual to have some element of discussion, partly because of the increasingly democratic style of organisations and partly because the variety of relevant technology requires a correspondingly wide range of expertise. In any case there is a need for widespread intercommunication which may be mainly informal but requires some formality to ensure that clashes of attitude do not delay or distort decisions and to make sure also that finalised decisions are unambiguously recorded. If this intercommunication is not properly arranged there will be the familiar symptoms of frustrating reiteration, decisions being misunderstood or being constantly revised, political manoeuvring and even concealment of progress within one or more of the teams. As the overall design progresses the information storage system becomes increasingly important. If insufficient attention has been devoted to the design of this and also the related access procedures the symptoms are a plethora of documentation which no individual entirely understands, the temptation to do it again rather than waste time finding out how something has already been done and too much reliance on the human memory. The behavioural symptoms of inadequate organisation of design teams are summarised in Table 1.1. As the system is made more definitive by the selection of particular physical mechanisms there should be parallel activity in the consideration of how these things are to be used and maintained by the human operator. Note that the philosophy here is that all the hardware is ultimately an extension of and a support for human functions. This is the concept of all systems as human beings with various kinds of engineering aids (Singleton, 1967a). functions are delegated from the human operator rather than allocated to him. This extreme ergonomics stance serves as an antidote to the equally extreme engineering approach in which systems are regarded basically as hardware which for reasons of economic or technological limitations have to depend occasionally on some human performance. Even if there is no dependence on human performance in the on-line operational mode it is bound to exist in the maintenance mode. In either case, there will eventually be a need for the consideration of the kinds of human operators required and how they are to be selected and trained. Traditionally these personnel functions were regarded as quite separate from   design functions and indeed they were often left until the hardware design and commissioning was virtually complete. The essence of the systems approach is that personnel decisions should proceed in parallel with engineering decisions, partly to economise on development time and partly to provide scope for trade-offs. One factor which has given renewed emphasis to this need for cooperation is the increased use of simulation (p. 128). Simulators were originally considered to be training devices but their use is now extending into other fields such as personnel assessment and as aids to the design of the information interfaces. It used to be considered that simulator specifications could only be proposed when the on-line system design had been completed but there are considerable advantages in developing the simulator before the on-line system so that it becomes a dynamic mock-up of the real situation. Detailed evaluations can be carried out on this mock-up before the real system is constructed. All systems are constructed from bought-in components which may themselves be complex enough to warrant a human factors evaluation. for example, a motor/pump system may well have its own controls, there will be standard maintenance procedures and there will be an operation/maintenance manual. All of these can be assessed from the point of view of clarity of presentation and ease of use. The system being constructed will require its own operating instructions, maintenance procedures and perhaps safety regulations. The design and preparation of this documentation has a Human factors component. It is a matter of storage, access to and presentation of information. Even at the design stage it is useful also to recognise that all this material will require procedures for updating in the light of experience Finally it must be accepted that technological and operational expertise is never complete. The operators of plant are bound to discover by experience aspects of the design which could be improved. There should be a mechanism for feeding this information back to the designers so that the succeeding system designs will avoid these problems. In particular, human performance within systems is impossible to predict with any precision and details of this performance as it occurs in practice or on simulators is the only basis for prediction on matters such as safety and system reliability either for the current system or for future systems. Potential human factors inputs to the large scale design process are summarised in fig. 1.4. In all behavioural matters and indeed in many technical matters also it is important to avoid the impression that when operations in practice contain undesirable features not predicted by designers then the designers have made mistakes. This may be true in a formal sense but allocation of blame is not usually a productive exercise particularly from a learning view-point. It is valuable to inculcate the attitude that everyone learns, that is, design and operating staff all improve on the basis of experience with feed-back. The exposure and remedy of facets of systems performance which are not entirely as predicted is in everyone's interest. One example of this is matters to do with safety: it is always useful to collect \\u2018critical incident\\u2019 data as well as accident data as one part of the feed-back about system performances. The setting up of routines for this communication is another aspect of ergonomics. In summary, although the basic contribution of the ergonomist is to the design of information interfaces these interfaces extend far beyond the man-machine interface found in the control room. They include the documentation of the design itself, communication within the design team, between designers and suppliers and between designers and operators (fig. 1.5). The operations staff include those who set it up, those who control it during operations, those who maintain it, and eventually those who have to dismantle it. To give one example of the size of the documentation problem it is not unusual for a large process plant to have two or three hundred volumes of instructions. These include the operating instructions, the maintenance instructions, the suppliers' instruction manuals, the safety regulations and instructions for particular emergencies. The design of smaller systems The design of a machine or device which is assigned as an aid for one person will not usually encounter the problems associated with elaborate design teams just described, but nevertheless some human factors sensitivity will help to provide a better product. This can be important not only from the point of view of efficiency in design and use but also in improving the sales appeal. It is increasingly common for advertisements to emphasise features such as\\u2018man-machine harmony\\u2019 or \\u2018user friendliness\\u2019. The implication is that ergonomics has been properly applied. There is a need for formal ergonomics in any design where the designer himself is not an experienced user. Some hand tools are beautifully designed to match the user, e.g. the two-handed scythe. In these cases it is clear that the design developed by constant trial in practice. There are others, however, where even after centuries of use this matching is not obviously satisfactory, for example violin playing would seem to be posturally a disaster, but there may be some subtle aids to very precise control of the sound generated in having the source of sound very close to the ear and perhaps some vibration transmission by the direct contact of this instrument and the jawbone. Ergonomics is concerned with the transmission of information. for modest design enterprises information exchange is needed between the designer and the potential user, between the designer and the producer and between the designer/producer and the customer/actual user (Fig. 1.6). The designer needs to know about the tasks which his new device is intended to aid and also about the kind of person who will use it. Clearly, designing for fit young men in the armed forces has different constraints from designing for middle-aged female workers in manufacturing. Some of the required   information may be susceptible to precise description in numerical terms such as body size and strength, but most of it will be of the \\u2018awareness\\u2019 kind when the designer recognises broadly that particular kinds of people have particular advantages and limitations. Similarly the range of tasks for which the device is required may not be known in the kind of detail which is available from comprehensive task descriptions but the designer will consider the extremes of what it is likely to be used for and the environment in which it will be used, for example designing a machine-tool for use in a factory has different requirements from designing a powered garden tool where the user could be wearing heavy gloves, will not be wearing safety-boots and will not receive any formal training. Communication between the designer and the producer used to be done almost entirely by traditional engineering drawings but there is now a tendency to use sketches, schematic drawings, photographs and models including computer-based models, for example complicated shapes in three dimensions are difficult to represent as rectangular projections and are not easily interpreted. Communication with the customer/user takes the form of operating instructions which are contained in an instruction book. The design of this book, booklet or even leaflet is a much neglected art and is frequently very badly executed \\u2014 hence the common attitude reflected in the aphorism \\u2018when all else fails try reading the instructions\\u2019. The most common failings are to rely too much on words rather than extensively labelled diagrams, to use technical terms and concepts which the user may not understand, to focus on what it is at the expense of what it does and to fail to separate the needs of the operator from the details which are needed to set up the device, to locate faults, to provide remedies and to provide routine maintenance. An extended booklet should have a very good index or other access system to the information. The designer is not the person to evaluate the clarity and usability of instructions, a sample of actual users will provide a much better assessment. further details are given on p. 76. The design of macro-systems The larger systems which make up communities and nations are currently in a state of flux because of the impact of technology. The provision of such a variety of telecommunication and travel facilities makes it impossible for any community however large or small to develop in isolation. The consequence is an increasingly standardised way of life or at least aspirations towards a particular way of life across the world. The differences which remain are enforced mainly by differences in average income and in style of government. Technology continues to change jobs with consequent changes in ways  of life and it also changes life-expectation which has profound effects on all communities. However, just as hardware systems are dominated by engineering thinking, macro-systems are dominated by economic thinking. There is excessive reliance on the adaptability of people who are required to adjust to whatever is dictated by economic and technological policies. Politicians in all countries would accept the proposition that the system should be designed to serve the people but whatever the political philosophy behind the system, the people always seem to be more its servants than its masters. Economic issues are real enough and it is often pointed out that politics is about priorities. The priorities are assessed on the basis of evidence and unfortunately evidence about people is not so readily quantified as evidence about financial and physical resources. The result is that systems at every level from the state to the small company are evaluated and policies are developed which are not sufficiently orientated to the needs and aspirations of the people within the system. This is a very large issue mostly beyond the scope of this book except to note that ergonomics is an exemplar of a style of thinking which is based on characteristics of people. Ergonomics can be defined as systems design with the attributes of people as the frame of reference. Although the human operator is for many purposes within ergonomics appropriately considered as a mere information processing device, any design issue must be considered in the context that these human operators are individuals and citizens within communities. What they believe, what they want, what they like, what they dislike and whether they work efficiently or not are determined by the societal context as well as by the physical environment. It is therefore appropriate to bear in mind the position and trends in human resources in the community of which the workers are members. For such macro-systems, the principle that the designer produces what he thinks the users need is being replaced by the principle that the users themselves decide what they want and the professionals assist them in designing as specified by the users. This approach generates another duty for designers and ergonomists, to present to the users an array of possible options which will aid their discussions and choices. Knowledge Demographic data Currently there are about 4.5 billion people in the world, 1 billion in the developed world and 3.5 billion in the developing world (Table 1.2). This puts a correct perspective on the contents of this book which are mainly concerned with technologically-based societies although there is a section in   Chapter 3 on ergonomics in developing countries. Most of the evidence and experience reported here has been derived from the 16% of the world population living in Europe and North America. The two worlds differ markedly in the distribution of populations, developed countries have about 65% of the population in the economically active age range from 15\\u201364 years, about 25% under 15 and the remaining 10% in retirement. This last group is still increasing quite rapidly. The retired group is much smaller in developing countries where about 55% are in the economically active age range and more than 40% are under 15. Life expectation at  birth is about 45 years in developing countries and more than 70 years in developed countries. The longer life expectation of females is more marked in the developed countries (Table 1.3). The age distribution of the working population for two countries, one developed and one developing, which happen to have the same sized labour force is shown in fig. 1.7. West Germany has a greater proportion of people economically active but they start work later and retire earlier than do workers in Pakistan. There are about 4 million research and development scientists and engineers in the world, 3.5 million in developed countries and 0.5 million in developing countries, almost all this latter 0.5 million are in Asia, the numbers in Latin America and Africa are very small (UNESCO statistical year book). The differences in various amenities are shown in Table 1.4. The energy consumption is about 100 units (kg of coal equivalent per person) in a developing country and about 10000 units in Europe and the U.S.A. This is affected by the fact that developing countries mostly have tropical or sub-tropical climates while developed countries are in the temperate zone, but there is a similar difference of about 100: 1 in income per head between the rich countries and the poor countries (The Economist \\u2014 the world in figures ). Within any country the Human Resource situation can be approached by this basic division into the \\u2018economically active\\u2019 and others who, for one reason or another, are supported by the workers. Those supported include young children, students, retired persons, seriously disabled persons, people living on independent means and, somewhat unfairly, women doing domestic work. The numbers and proportions of those economically active in a sample of developed countries are shown in Table 1.5. It will be seen that in each country this economically active group is about half the total population. for males the proportion is usually about 55% and for females about 45%. A very large economy such as the U.S.A. has more than 100 million workers, the large European countries have about 25 million workers. Japan is about half-way between with about 60 million workers. The smaller European countries have less than 5 million workers. Workers in this sense are a country's Human Resource which is deployed for the benefit of the community generally. The primary need of any person or population is water and food and in primitive societies the supply of these commodities will absorb the effort of almost all the workforce. As food supplies improve it is possible to move some of the Human Resource into construction and manufacturing. In the U.K. the concentration on manufacturing in the nineteenth century was balanced by the importing of food. France, by contrast, had a smaller manufacturing base but remained self-sufficient in food so that the dramatic fall of proportion of   workers in primary industries did not occur until after World War II (fig. 1.8). In the U.S.A. even at the time of President Lincoln about 1860 there was serious debate as to whether the economy should remain agricultural or whether there should be a positive attempt to develop manufacturing. In India the total population is currently about 665 million of which 244 million (37%) are economically active. 153 million are engaged in agriculture and fishing, that is 63% of the working population (I.L.O. data). In the U.K. less than 3% of the working population are now employed in agriculture, in most advanced countries this figure is now well below 10%, as illustrated in fig. 1.9. This also shows that the predominant way of earning a living in a developed country  now is in the service industries. fig. 1. 10 shows the current distribution of U.K. Human Resources. The former basic industries \\u2014 mining, agriculture, construction and manufacturing \\u2014 now employ about a third of the total workforce. In manufacturing between 1980 and 1985 output measured per person-hour or per person employed increased by about 25% but the total   output remained roughly constant, that is the manufacturing labour force is still falling rapidly (Economic Trends 1985). Some consequences of these trends are discussed in more detail in Singleton and Crawley (1980). From the end of World War II to the early 1970s there was virtually full employment in developed countries, but in the last ten years the position has changed considerably as shown in fig. 1.11. Apart from Ireland it would seem that the smaller European countries have contained the situation better than have the larger ones, but this is an artefact since other small countries such as Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark follow the same trend as the larger countries. It should be noted that the trend of an increase in unemployment from about 5% to about 10% over ten years is sufficiently general to indicate that it is not a function of the style of government. These data for countries do not reveal considerable underlying differences within countries. In England for example, unemployment in the North is twice that in the South-East, and in most European countries there are lesser employment opportunities in rural   areas as opposed to urban areas resulting in depopulation of the countryside and an increase in the size of cities. This trend is even more marked in developing countries. Human resource utilisation This brief excursion into the complex field of labour statistics is intended to illustrate the following points which are relevant to the theory and practice of ergonomics. 1. Since the beginnings of technology, now about 200 years ago in the case of the U.K., the labour market has been in a continuous state of flux. 2. The overall shift has not been so much from agriculture to manufacturing but rather a steady rise in the service industries, and a fall in primary industries. 3. The manufacturing labour force in developed countries is now in   accelerating decline as productivity and the investment per worker increases, this is resulting in a further increase in service industries and an increase in unemployment. 4. There are considerable differences between the problems of so-called developed and developing countries. This dichotomy is useful but is an oversimplification; degree of development as measured for example by income per head or technology utilisation is best described by a continuous scale. A particular country is at one point on that scale at one time by one measure. 5. Accelerating technological development has pushed the government of every country off-balance in the past decade. This is illustrated in developed countries by the increase in unemployment which is fundamentally a failure to properly utilise the total Human Resource. In developing countries there are many contrasts in that high technology (airlines, nuclear power, information systems; etc.) exists in small pockets alongside the still unresolved traditional problems of inadequate nutrition and health. 6. Ergonomics also is pushed off-balance because the variety of human work increases in parallel with technology. The traditional problems of heat stress and physical work-load remain, particularly in the developing countries, while new problems appear as more complex systems are designed requiring new operator roles and more serious consequences of inadequate performance. 7. Nevertheless technology now provides the possibility of allocating high energy and repetitive work to machines so that the typical man at work is in a supervising rather than an operating mode. 8. When machines provide the energy and set the pace the objective of the operator (and consequently of ergonomics) shifts from rates and amounts to quality, reliability and safety. 9. The general concept of work is also shifting from man-machine interaction to man-man interaction with machines as aids. 10. Many of the policy issues are mistakenly addressed in that there is too much emphasis on finding uses for what technology can provide rather than driving technology by the needs of people. The behavioural specialists are responsible for providing data and attitudes for the policy-makers which should redress the balance. 11. The economic concept of work is too narrow for ergonomics. There are many ergonomics problems in the non-economically active half of the population. If ergonomics is regarded as the science of work then work must be defined as purposeful activity rather than merely as activity for economic gain. 12. This brief statistical survey reveals the scale and diversity of problems  associated with the mind at work. This is daunting but it is also challenging and stimulating. Principles, methods and procedures Education, work and leisure Virtually all human societies have developed the principle that the pattern of personal activity should change with age. In the early years there is extensive leisure devoted to play in which the basic manipulative and social skills are developed. There is also more formalised learning through an educational system which concentrates mainly on information processing: reading, writing and arithmetic and more elaborate symbolic and organisational skills. When the individual has matured he usually accepts responsibilities for child-rearing and for work. In his declining years the proportion of leisure increases again, sometimes suddenly when he \\u2018retires\\u2019 but preferably gradually as his energies diminish. Thus we can normally expect a mature mind in a person at work and although developmental processes of growth and senescence are of some interest, studies of the person working usually assume that we are dealing with a mind which is equipped with the basic skills derived from play and education but one which has not been subject to any serious diminution of capacity. This is not to suggest that the age variable can be ignored. It is accepted that ageing is a continuous process from birth to death and there are considerable differences between the average worker in the 25\\u201345 age group and the apparent equivalent in the 46\\u201365 age group. The age distribution of a particular workforce can materially affect the problems of work design and training. Correspondingly it must be recognised that an individual has entered work with a particular educational standard. During his working years he has considerable leisure which is bound to have some interactions with work. for approximate computational purposes it is normally assumed in the western world that a full working year is no more than 200 man-days. The remaining 165 days disappear in week-ends, holidays and absence for training, sickness and so on. There is also a widespread convention that the working day should be 7\\u20138 hours, that is about a third of the total day. Thus the full-time worker is in fact working for less than 200% of the total time. The distinction between work and leisure and between work and education is an arbitrary one from the point of view of stress on the person. for example, many city office workers regard the main stress of the day as the difficulties in getting from home to work and back again with work as a relatively relaxed period between. Even more strikingly, some working mothers regard a period  at work, particularly if it is part-time, as a welcome respite from the great variety of stresses arising in looking after a home and children. Some of the most exacting university degrees, such as those in the biological and physical sciences demand a level of work load from the conscientious student which is greater than that expected in most occupations. One would expect self-selected leisure activities to be different from and complementary to those at work. for example, the manual labourer is unlikely to take up an energetic hobby such as cycling and he is likely to spend his holidays relaxing at the seaside rather than walking in the mountains. The young office worker in a safe sedentary job may well take up rock-climbing as a dangerous, physically exacting antidote for the dull occupational part of his life. Although it would be convenient scientifically and sometimes personally to regard work as a separable part of a human life this separation is never entirely valid and can be misleading. The mind at work is part of the person at work and that same person has many other activities in the past and the future and in parallel which have their interactions with the work. In system jargon, the working world is one sub-system within a complete set of sub-systems which make up the total environment or life space of the individual. To study one sub-system in detail without regard to interactions with the others is usually inadequate, but on the other hand, to try to examine simultaneously the whole complex of sub-systems is to invite disorientation. The remedy is a compromise in which activity in one sub-system such as that which incorporates work is studied but in the context of sensitivity to external influences. Systems theory can be applied in many ways to behaviour at work. The two main theories emphasise respectively interactions with other people;socio-technical systems and interactions with machines;man-machine systems . Socio-technical systems In the period of technological innovation following the second world war a group of human relations specialists, working from the Tavistock Institute in London, noted that the social behaviour of workers and their organisational structure in groups and teams was influenced by the technical systems associated with that work. The first studies were in coal mines where there were different degrees of mechanisation associated with the same type of working group and it was also possible to distinguish different social organisations working in similar technical environments (Trist and Murray, 1948). Some groups were organised so that each worker carried out an independent part-task with little reference to  the total task, whereas in other cases each worker had a commitment to the total task and carried out various sub-tasks in this context. This latter, labelled a \\u2018composite\\u2019 group as distinct from a conventional group, had greater productive achievement and lower absenteeism. More generally, the effectiveness of the production system depends on the way the social system is adjusted to the technical requirements (Emery and Trist, 1960). Technological decisions necessarily dominate the design of the system in the sense of how the collective task of transforming inputs into outputs is achieved. Nevertheless, the social system which integrates the activities of the workers and provides the flexibility for relating separate tasks to the needs of the production system as a whole must be considered. Hence the concept of the socio-technical system where technical and social requirements are harmonised into one effective organisation. The organisation, like a living organism, maintains a dynamic equilibrium with the environment. Thus it is an open system rather than a closed one and its behaviour cannot be understood by simply looking at the relationship between inputs and outputs. The adaptability of the enterprise may lie in providing appropriate outputs to match the changes of the market from relatively stable physical inputs or may lie in providing a fixed output with changing sources of inputs. In either case there is no fixed relationship between physical inputs and outputs, the system responds to the environment. It follows that one of the main tasks of management is to control the interaction with the environment. The implication also is that, if management has got the technology right within the system design, it should then attend to the environment and should allow, within the internal activities, scope for self-organising into autonomous groups. If, on the contrary, there is a rigid internal separation between the roles of setting standards and meeting standards then conflict has been built into the system (Klein, 1979). This approach can legitimately be regarded as the parent of organisation theory (p. 143), and of the \\u2018quality of working life\\u2019(QWOL), sometimes also called the \\u2018job design\\u2019 movement (Davis and Cherns 1975, Davis and Taylor 1972). It provides considerable insight into the eventual difficulties of the early twentieth century mass production methods as exemplified by the moving belt type assembly line. On the other hand it does not provide remedies for production problems which can be applied as standard recipes or procedures. Again, because of the elusive if all-pervading nature of the theme, it is difficult to formalise into legislation on humanising work as several European countries have discovered by experience. It has emerged in many countries that, as the standard of living rises, it is more and more difficult to run an autocratic production system using the  indigenous labour force. The first management remedy is to import a more docile labour force from another country or from a less developed part of the same country. This is only a temporary solution and there have been many attempts to organise more humane working systems. The danger here is that, although things may be pleasant for the workers, the incentive to work very hard is not so direct and it may not be possible to maintain a competitive position in comparison with the same industry in a developing country. Hence a further development of research on work motivation (p. 144). Taking a more global view, one opinion is that the manufacturing industries should indeed move to developing countries whilst the advanced industries orientate their labour forces toward information and other service industries. There is a trend in this direction (Singleton and Crawley, 1980), but, of course, it is not the complete answer. There are other complications. Robots, for example, are best suited for the highly repetitive manufacturing tasks which are the ones least suited to human efforts so that robotisation can cure some of the ills of mass production. Looking at the environment, as market demands become more sophisticated so there is a need for operator flexibility in production system outputs, which has its counterpart in greater variety of work within the production system (Lupton and Tanner, 1980). Socio-technical system theory has been highly fruitful in generating other academic lines of development: organisation theory, quality of working life concepts and work motivation, in stimulating many innovations in production organisation and in provoking governments to consider legislation in matters such as humanisation of work (Germany) and co-determination at work (Sweden). Paradoxically it has not developed a formalised set of principles or immutable knowledge which could, for example, be structured into an academic text-book about socio-technical systems. The problem seems to be that it is fundamentally about attitudes to work and such attitudes are subject to an inextricable and non-monotonic range of influences not only from work itself, with all the pressures of technological change, but also from prevailing economic, social and cultural changes in the community generally. Man-machine systems Work is very rarely performed by a man without the aid of some machinery and correspondingly machines rarely function for very long without human intervention. Man and machine can be regarded as sub-systems each making a distinctive contribution towards the achievement of the purposes of the working system. The system itself can be described as a set of functions necessary for the overall purpose. The emphasis on defining the system in terms of its purposes or objectives and analysing it in terms of its functions are the characteristics of the systems approach. It follows that at some stage in the design process it should be useful to consider how the various functions are most effectively allocated \\u2014 to man or to machine. Fig. 1.2 shows the essentials of the system design process but since feed-back paths are omitted this figure does not indicate either the repetition and iteration which goes on in operational design or the different possible priorities and variability in the order of decision-making. The engineering emphasis will be on the search for mechanisms which can most effectively perform the required functions with the human operator in a support role undertaking functions which are not readily mechanised. The ergonomics emphasis will be on the human operator as the navigator moving towards the system objectives supported by various mechanisms. One neutral viewpoint is to consider formally the relative advantages and limitations of men and machines. These can be listed (Table 1.6) on what is called a \\u2018Fitts List\\u2019 after Paul Fitts who originally proposed this approach (Fitts, 1951). At the time it was hoped that eventually it would be possible to refine the quantitative distinctions between the performance of men and machines so that allocation of function decisions would be unambiguous (Wuffeck and Zeitlin, 1962), but this has not happened. The reason seems to be that men and machines are fundamentally complementary rather than comparable, this point was originally made by Jordan (1963). If a required function can be specified precisely then a mechanism can be designed to perform it. The reasons for incorporating men in systems are to do with properties such as flexibility and adaptability which by their nature are not specifiable in numerical terms. Incidentally this clarifies why the man-machine system is such a potent combination. Each provides attributes which are not easily available from the other. A man without the support of machinery is physically weak and informationally slow. A machine without human guidance is inflexible and highly limited in recognition and learning facilities. Nevertheless it is not common practice to consider the man-machine allocation of function as an isolated design decision. More usually the allocation emerges from a pattern of related decisions including what can be reliably and economically achieved by hardware and software, what the allocated tasks look like as integrated jobs for the human operators, the skills and traditions of the available work-force, the importance of safety and reliability and so on(Table 1.7). As potential functional weaknesses emerge during the design appraisal further consideration is given to what functions might be allocated to the man or machine to provide greater mutual support. The result of selective competent design along these lines should be a system with optimal man-machine allocation given the technological state of the art and a comprehensive sensitivity to the feasibility of the human tasks. A detailed discussion of the historical development of the allocation of function concept is given in Singleton (1974). This approach contravenes currently fashionable Human Factors methodology that there should be a formal attempt to carry out man-machine allocation. Operational experience of real systems design reinforces doubts about the allocation of function concept as a basis for a unitary systematic procedure. The paradigm illustrated in fig. 1.12 has the virtue of simplicity. Like many block diagrams this conceals the practical problems. from such a simple diagram it is easy to assume that all the thinking is done in terms of functions. This cannot be sustained because the only way to validate task analysis is to switch from functional concepts to behavioural concepts and the only way to validate hardware concepts is to switch to thinking in terms of specific mechanisms. Thus, allocation of function requires a continuous juggling of functional, mechanistic and behavioural approaches. In addition to the separate criteria related to men and mechanisms there are others to do with information acquisition, storage and presentation focussing on the interface design which has its own design criteria. Note that a real problem usually involves men rather than one man and thus there are extensive man-man communication issues where few of the functions could conceivably be allocated to non-human mechanisms. In a military command and control situation these will typically be sub-system operators, supervisors and customers using the output (p. 243). Even when design attention can be focussed on the interaction within a single man-machine sub-system it emerges that the man may have very different roles in setting-up, operation and maintenance of his particular machine and each role may require separate man-machine allocation considerations. A designer is often restricted by various mandatory requirements based for example on imagined safeguards against accidents. There are also unspecifiable but none the less potent political restrictions, some from within the organisation, some from outside it. For example the use of nuclear power in either the military or the civil sense is regarded as qualitatively different from non-nuclear power in its safety, control and management requirements. Design is never an isolated logical process. There is a legacy of experience from earlier designs which inevitably guide and inhibit a new design. The shifts  of allocation of function from this point of view are illustrated in Fig. 1.13. Swain and Wohl (1961) argue that the man-machine concept is oversimplified, it should be man-machine procedures allocation and also that prime equipment should be separated from check-out equipment (Fig. 1. 14) In equipment involving advanced technology the allocation of the control function is between the on-line operator and the designer. The latter builds decisions into the hardware and software based on his knowledge of the limitations of the mechanisms. High technology can also be used to provide the operator with flexibility in the allocation of functions, he can make his own  decision about when to control manually and when to leave it to the mechanisms. This is called supervisory control (Fig. 1. 15) It emerges from the above discussion that man-machine allocation of function is at best an oversimplification and it may lead to the neglect of some key features of human performance. Only the human operator can cope with the concept of purposes and goals and more particularly with their modification in the light of changing circumstances. Knowledge of circumstances is communicated partly by information exchange across man-machine interfaces   but also by verbal exchanges between people. These verbal exchanges can be factual but can also be diffuse in the sharing of attitudes, beliefs, urgencies, doubts and so on. These features are just as important to efficient performance as are data about plant functions but they cannot be incorporated in a man-machine allocation process. Implicit in the attempt to complete a systematic man-machine function allocation is the principle that some trade-off is possible. More attention to the hardware and information presentation will yield improved operator support whereas more attention to operator training will minimise the difficulties of interpreting information presentations and thereby making full use of machines (Singleton, 1967b). These alternative procedures are summarised by the expressions \\u2018fitting the man to the job\\u2019 or \\u2018fitting the job to the man\\u2019. The systems approach indicates that the two should be balanced on technical, economic and behavioural criteria (Table 1.8.). To proceed systematically, both require that there should be the greatest possible understanding of what the man is required to do. The design of the man-machine interface must develop from an understanding of how the man is expected to interact with the machine and correspondingly the design of selection, allocation and training schemes depends on knowing what is required of the operator. The study of demands on the operator requires task analysis. In this context the term \\u2018machine\\u2019 is used as shorthand for the total hardware and software system or, in other terminology, the plant. For information systems the allocation of function and interface design issues merge into the procedure for considering the required points of human intervention in the total information network. From this point of view the allocation of function and interface design are one core design activity based on the man-machine concept. Task analysis Terminology In the context of systems design, task analysis has become the generic term applicable to the field study of human performance. This is somewhat confusing because the centre of interest may be jobs or skills rather than tasks, and strictly the procedure is often more accurately described as one of synthesis rather than analysis. For example, a designer may build up a sequence of actions which an operator must follow in order to cause his product to function properly \\u2014 he has synthesised the task from a knowledge of how the machine or other product was designed to function. Nevertheless, such activity comes under the heading of task analysis (Fig. 1.16). Tasks represent the human contribution to system performance but for   purposes of personnel selection, training and allocation, it is necessary for tasks to be separated or combined into jobs. For systems which have evolved on the basis of operational experience rather than those which have been created by a formal design process, job analysis rather than task analysis may be the starting point of human factors studies. The ergonomist will begin his investigation by the consideration of what the personnel actually do in their jobs which have emerged and been refined by practice and personal preference rather than design. A task is usually considered to be an integrated sub-activity with a particular  purpose as distinct from a job which is a particular kind of work carried out by an individual in a system context. Jobs are collections of tasks or parts of tasks. Occupation is the wider term which covers a range of jobs and the career of an individual in a community context. For example, management is an occupation, a production manager is a job, and work scheduling is a task. These distinctions are demonstrated in Fig. 1. 17. Another source of ambiguity is that task analysis is often used as a generic term covering any study and description relating to people at work. Sometimes this is no more than a description of what has to be done but sometimes it incorporates how the operator does it or should do it. Strictly, this latter should be called a skill description rather than a task description. In principle a task description is not necessarily an activity of   a person, the task might possibly be completed automatically. There is no such ambiguity about a skills analysis which is always person-orientated and not just system-orientated. This confusion of terms obscures even further the difficult technical problems of moving from a task description to a skill description. The task description should emerge logically from the system design and more particularly from the allocation of functions. There is no such deductive way of getting at the skill description. This can only be done by studying operators. There are two problems in analysing tasks: one is to acquire the evidence on which to base the task description, the other is to record what has been found out in a way such that other people, notably the interface designers and the personnel specialists, can use it effectively to assist in their work. It aids clarity   to reserve the term analysis to mean the acquisition of evidence and description to mean the presentation of the evidence. The test of a task description is: does it indicate a necessary function within the system performance? The test of a skill description is: does it indicate how an individual goes about a task, does it allow for individual differences such as those between a highly skilled operator and a mediocre one? For routine low-level tasks there may be no great distinction between a task description and skill description but for high-level tasks there will be a considerable difference. Skills analysis is an attempt to get at what is going on in the operator's mind. For a repetitive task there may be comparatively little going on in the mind which emerges at the level of consciousness. For example, the assembly of a set of components will be carried out by an experienced operator without thinking about it. He may be surprised when the analyst reveals the complexities of his hand movements and finger manipulations. The only way he can recall what he does is by doing it, literally \\u2018going through the motions\\u2019. On the other hand, for a task such as fault diagnosis he will be thinking about it in various structured ways which he can reveal by talking about it and exploring verbally why he looks at particular indications or takes particular actions. Human tasks and the purposes of task analysis are too varied for there to be one standard procedure for either analysis or description. Analysing a task where the main requirement is speed of response is different from analysing a task in which problem solving is required. A task analysis in the context of \\u2018fitting the man to the job\\u2019 can be very different from one designed to assist in \\u2018fitting the job to the man\\u2019. As mentioned above the two extremes of human tasks are the procedure and the diagnosis. Procedural task analysis is usually initiated on the basis of technology and logic by the designer. A task has been allocated to the human operator and what he must do is a function of the needs of the hardware. Such tasks may be in operation or maintenance. In either case the designer writes down the sequence of actions which must be taken coupled with informational indications of what should be happening. For example, in starting up a machine or system (Table 1.9). Effectively the operating instructions are the task description. It is, of course, desirable to check that nothing has been forgotten and to this end it is usual to ask an operator to go through the designed procedure while observing what he does and also observing that the system performs as expected. This may be done on the machine if it is available, or on a simulator or on some kind of mock-up of what the system will be like. This is known as the talk through or walk through method of task analysis. The difference is only in the kind of task and size of hardware. For example, in the case of starting up a machine at a control panel the operator will be given the instructions and   asked to provide a verbal commentary as he actuates the various controls and checks the various indications, this is a \\u2018talk through\\u2019. On the other hand, a maintenance check of a series of related machines may involve moving to and fro between them while activating this and that, this is a \\u2018walk through\\u2019. The operating instructions/task description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator's point of view; anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around, manipulating controls or checking information presentations. Ultimately, the machine layout or interface design may be modified to make the operating instructions easier to follow. For complex processes the procedures can include stages of diagnosis (see below) because the operator has to monitor and interpret what is happening in the plant. In particular he is aware of various conditional constraints which form a multidimensional envelope, and whatever happens he must keep the plant state within this envelope. Thus he must have extensive knowledge of the parameters and their relationship, e.g. pressure/temperature curves, together with the safety limits of each parameter. Sometimes the safety limits are fixed, sometimes they are conditional on the state of other variables or plant, sometimes they are merely probabilistic. This is an extremely difficult task, and   the operator requires various aids such as alarm systems and automatic cut-out devices which are also effectively monitoring the parameters approaching limits (see alarm systems p. 225). Diagnostic task analysis is even more complex and may indeed be virtually impossible to complete. It depends on the complexity of the task faced by the operator. The range of diagnostic task difficulties for a control centre is shown in Table 1.10. The operator is assumed to be reacting to a situation in a  control room, containing a great variety of dials, charts, and computer driven displays together with the controls needed to take action in any part of the system. The simplest thing that can go wrong is the failure of one mechanism such as a pump, valve or thermostat. This will be indicated in the control room by changes in pressures and temperatures which the skilled operator will trace readily to the particular failure. Usually there will be some redundancy in the system so that other mechanisms can take over. If the hiatus is serious he may have to shut down all or part of the system or it may trip automatically and the operator's task is to observe/control the shut-down to a quiescent state. The worst possible condition that can be envisaged is one in which there is an expert in the plant aiming to do the maximum possible damage and aware of the indications of his actions which are transmitted to the operator \\u2014 this is not quite science-fiction, it could happen as a form of sabotage,. A much less demanding condition is one in which the saboteur is attempting to damage a plant about which he has little or no technical knowledge. However, the difficult condition which requires the most consideration because it is not that unlikely is one in which the operator is faced with a situation where various things have gone wrong naturally or by inadvertent human interference in the plant or instrumentation. His diagnostic task is somehow to differentiate between the information he is receiving which is false and that which is valid and follow this by the selection of a remedial strategy. There are further complications in that, because of the plant failures, not all the standard range of remedial actions will be available. Some automatic reactions may be taking place which might help or hinder, and he must also stay within the mandatory operating instructions. Unfortunately, because such situations are created by combinations of events the number of possibilities is very large and it would be prohibitively tedious to enumerate all of them. A complete task description is impossible and the appropriate preparation for the operator is not in direct training but rather in education/understanding of the system and the way it operates. He must attempt his diagnosis by returning to the relevant scientific and technological principles. How he does this in general terms is illustrated in Fig. 1. 18. The task analysis will take the form of a consideration of the most likely or most dangerous failure and combinations of failures and the ways in which these will appear as indications in the control room. This should occur not only at the design stage but also as experience develops in operating the plant and data on actual failures and failure rates become available. Such task analysis can only be carried out to some cost-effective limit beyond which the skilled operator must be trusted to get things right by applying his broad expertise. This is not as much of a gamble as it may appear at first sight, there are general principles of how to cope with the system, some  of which can be built into automatic safeguards and some of which can be conveyed to the operator as knowledge and instructions. In serious cases the aim is to shut down the system safely. In less serious cases the operator may for a while maintain certain parameters at appropriate levels without diverting his attention to detailed diagnosis, this is called function control . In dealing with lower technology or less formal system design, there is a range of relatively standard ways of finding out about operator performance   by studying it directly. Task analysis, in common with every other perceptual process, is a matter of setting up mechanisms for categorisation and filtering. The analyst is faced with an activity which is continuous, homogeneous and full of detail, some of which is significant and relevant and some of which is of no consequence. For example, the worker may pause at one point and scratch his nose, this may indicate that a critical decision is being made or it may indicate simply that his nose was itching. The art of task analysis always is to select what does matter, reject what does not matter and separate into categories or stages something which seems at first sight to have no internal boundaries. As already mentioned what is significant for a task description leading to an interface design may be different from what is significant for personnel allocation and training but the available procedures are the same. The acquisition of evidence and the presentation of evidence are linked, of course, in that it may be necessary to decide what should be presented before it is acquired although more usually it is a matter of presenting what can be acquired. The range of human tasks has already been indicated by the description of the extremes of procedural and diagnostic task analysis. The simplest kind of human task, and the most straightforward to observe and analyse, is that in which the operator goes through a standard sequence of actions. These are still common in industrial assembly and inspection tasks. The most complex and most difficult to analyse are tasks requiring original thinking often with many apparently random alternations between deduction and induction, this occurs in fault diagnosis tasks. There are at least two dimensions of complexity: the kind of task and whether the analysis focuses on material, information or people. These are illustrated in Table 1. 11. Each cell in this table represents an enormous variety of human work but this is hardly surprising since the total of eighteen cells covers all human work. There is a variety of task analysis methods available and the selection of an appropriate set varies with the kind of work (as represented by these cells) and also with the purposes of the analysis. Table 1.12 gives examples of kinds of task and the probably appropriate method of task analysis for each cell in Table 1.11. It should be emphasised that this is only a tentative illustration. The method used for a particular analysis depends on a great variety of factors including the analyst's expertise, the time available, the situations accessible for study, the related information already available, the purpose of the analysis and so on. Task analysis by observation Process charts . Accurate observation of what a person is doing is not easy. The observer needs some discipline which ensures that he really does   focus on the detail and separates the action into a coherent sequence. The required discipline is provided by the attempt to complete a chart such as a flow process chart using the A.S.M.E. symbols. These were originally standardised by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The symbols and an illustration of a flow process chart are shown in Fig. 1.19. It is assumed that whatever an operator is doing can be classified into one of five categories: operation, inspection, transport, delay and storage. Delay occurs when the operator is doing nothing \\u2014 usually waiting for a machine to complete a sub-task \\u2014 it differs from storage where there has been a particular decision to put something aside. For example, storage for a hand implies some static work \\u2014 the operator is holding something or exerting a force of some kind although there is no resulting movement. Process charts may concentrate on material, operator actions or the events in the process. These are known respectively as material-type, man-type or process-type charts. More details of these charts and how to complete them are given in ILO (1979). The same symbols are used for a two-handed process chart in which a detailed description of what each hand is doing separately is provided (Fig.  1.20). The meaning of the symbols changes somewhat because the separation of events is much more detailed. The same symbols can also be made to follow the concurrent behaviour of members of a team (Chapanis, 1959). Note that, apart from the inspection category, the emphasis is entirely on what the operator does. Little attention is paid to the input side as distinct from the output side, the sensory information and feed-back which the operator is using to control what he is doing is neglected. This is appropriate enough for highly repetitive routine tasks because, as mentioned earlier, the operator is probably proceeding with little conscious attention and the limitation on performance is in the speed of the action rather than in the informational control. To broaden the emphasis on a two-handed process chart it is possible to add   another column labelled \\u2018attention\\u2019 or \\u2018sensory activity\\u2019and to try to describe human activity in these areas at particular points in the sequence. This goes beyond direct observations and requires some inference or speculation on the part of the observer. Finer analysis of hand movements is possible using classifications such as Therbligs (Shaw, 1952), or Methods-Time-Measurement symbols (Maynard et al ., 1956). Analysis at this level of detail is not usually attempted by direct observation but rather by film or video analysis. Sequence charts . These are similar to flow process charts except that no standard symbols are used, the chart is simply a list of the actions the operator takes but there may well be additional columns referring to the events which occur and the consequent information which appears. A sequence chart is more appropriate for a routine interaction with a machine rather than a physical manipulation of objects. An example is given in Table 1. 1 3. Sequence charts are particularly useful for the study and description of starting up and shutting down procedures. They form the basis for procedural training. Link design charts . This is a detailed sequence chart orientated more towards operator choice of actions and correspondingly relevant to the study of interface design rather than training (Singleton, 1964). It is assumed that for every action the operator has a purpose, the choice of the particular action at the particular time or point in the sequence is triggered by some other event, usually the successful completion of an action is indicated by a particular information presentation which also is noted on the chart. The chart is particularly useful for detecting when information about action completion is not available and when an action is required which is not triggered by information from the situation. That is, the operator has to depend on his memory (which is unreliable). An example is given in Table 1. 14. Flow charts . These are more graphical presentations as distinct from verbal listings. They are used to indicate the spatial location and separation of events which are integral parts of the same process. An illustration of a flow chart is given in Fig. 1.21. It is possible to obtain a kind of flow chart automatically as it were by using successive photographs of operator positions on the same photographic plate. More usually, this is done by attaching lights to the wrists or to other parts of the body, if the light is flashing at a known frequency the relative time of particular positions as well as the sequence can be measured. This is called a chronocyclograph . Flow charts are a useful record of a process but are not  particularly suited as a basis for analysis which might lead to improved job design or training. On the other hand, they can clearly indicate differences in ways of doing something. Block diagrams . These are particularly useful to describe situations where events occur in parallel or in patterns rather than in a single series. The block diagram is highly versatile as a spatial representation of any process at any level, that is the same process can be represented by one block or by very many blocks which provide more detail. The art of useful block diagram production is to select the appropriate level of detail. Most people find such diagrams much easier to understand than paragraphs of explanatory prose but the flexibility itself can lead to the difficulties illustrated in Fig. 1.22. It is important that blocks are at about the same level of complexity within one diagram. Blocks may represent physical entities, topics, concepts, decisions, actions or processes. If these are mixed in the same diagram the distinctions between categories should be indicated by using differently shaped blocks. Many of the figures in this chapter illustrate this convention. Homogeneity is also desirable in the meaning of lines and arrows. A line may indicate a causal link but simple cause-effect relationships are destroyed if there are feed-back lines. Usually the line represents the flow of something but that something might be material, energy, information or time but again these should not be mixed on the same diagram unless differently coded lines are used. It is usually possible to invert a diagram so that blocks and lines are interchanged. One of the more subtle failures is to confuse a block diagram with its inverse. An inverted block diagram can be a path-node diagram. The advantage of these is that the length of the path can be used to indicate time taken. This is the basis of \\u2018critical-path analysis\\u2019 where such a network can be analysed. The shortest path through a network is the minimum time in which the whole process represented could be completed. The longest sequence of required activities is the time it will take if no adjustments are made. An optimum path can be selected and other activities adjusted to phase in with those on this \\u2018critical path\\u2019. There are formal techniques of network analysis which occasionally prove useful; for example, in identifying equivalent diagrams or ways of simplifying diagrams (Battersby, 1970). Algorithm charts . These are a particular form of block diagram where the emphasis is on binary choices. Again there can be concentration on events or on operator decisions. In the latter case these are usually an oversimplification because there is an underlying assumption that decisions are being made in a simple logical sequence. In practice, the operator jumps forwards and backwards within the pattern indicated on the chart rechecking some decisions and anticipating others. Nevertheless, by relating required information to decision points any lack of information can be revealed. It invariably turns out that an operator makes a series of decisions partly on the basis of what is currently displayed (on-line information ) and partly on the basis of other material obtained from his knowledge of the system performance, his briefing and his operating instructions (off-line information ). Adequate on-line and off-line information is essential for apposite decision-making. Fig. 1.23 shows such a chart. F.A.S. T. diagram . Function Analysis System Technique was developed by Bytheway (1977) within value engineering. It imposes useful discipline on the production of a functional diagram in two ways. Within each block the function should be described by a verb and a noun. The functions are arranged in a sequence such that an arrow to the right on any line indicates HOW? and an arrow to the left indicates WHY? If these criteria cannot be met then either the functions are in the wrong order or some are missing. The diagram should be produced by writing each function on a card, the cards are then arranged to meet the criteria. Unfortunately the resulting diagram is not so easy to interpret as are some of the other forms of chart. In particular there is no obvious starting or ending point and the lines do not indicate a sequence. Fig. 1.24 shows an example. General functional diagrams . As a Task Description, a block diagram is intended to illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the system with emphasis on human interactions within the system. For some purposes it is appropriate to use blocks and lines to indicate the flow of energy or material and to indicate all the ways in which the human operator can affect this flow. This is not a performance diagram but a potential performance diagram (Fig. 1.25). For other purposes it is appropriate to concentrate on a specific sequential task and illustrate the order of events involving human actions (e.g. Figs. 1. 19 and 1.20). If a particular dimension (usually left to right or up to down) indicates a time scale as well as sequence this is called a time-line diagram . The blocks may even be omitted to further emphasise the relative timing of events. (Fig. 1.26). Alternatively if the process is highly complex the emphasis may be on the pattern of events as indicated by a network of blocks with a specialist symbol indicating the many points within the system for which information for the operator might appear and another symbol for points where he can interfere in the system dynamics (Fig. 1.27). Task analysis by discussion Observation of operator performance within many high technology systems reveals nothing more than a person sitting at a desk scanning various kinds of displays at intervals and just occasionally picking up a telephone, making a note in a log-book or manipulating a control. In such situations, the task analysis requires extensive discussion rather than observation. Such discussions will centre on the operators themselves but may also involve others such as the management, the training officers, the safety specialists and the  system designers. There will often be complications in that there can be two or more operators working simultaneously with overlapping tasks. The supervisor may also monitor the same information or may have his own separate displays or both. In such a team operation there will normally be a clear standard mandatory difference of responsibility but in practice what they actually do can overlap and overlap differently for different teams. Inevitably, discussion with different individuals about a particular task will yield very   different versions of what is being done or should be done. If there is a written version of what ought to be being done this is a useful basic document. However the supervisor will point out that things have changed since that was produced and he will have his own view of the essentials of the task. The operators themselves will again have a different version. The differences will be   mainly in emphasis on what is important central activity and what is peripheral. Even between operators carrying out what is ostensibly the same task there will be discrepancies, particularly if the discussion extends from what is required to the way these requirements are met. Similarly the specialists, the training officers, task designers and safety officers will have their own version structured in terms of the particular difficulties they have had in their specific contributions to the task performance. Finally, task descriptions differ with the personal biases of analysts and the reasons why they are conducting the analysis. However, in spite of all these sources of ambiguity the comprehensive task description is the essential starting point for most human factors work. An approach structured by a particular procedure is of considerable assistance in reducing ambiguity and ensuring that the result is comprehensive. The approach might consist of any one or any combination of the following techniques. Responsibility charts . A useful starting point for the study of any system is a responsibility chart. This can indicate not only the hierarchy but also the different levels of modelling the system. Normally, the operators closest to the plant will have the most detailed information and this gets condensed or reduced as one moves up the hierarchy. For example in a power station the desk operator will monitor the detail of the plant performance, the supervisor will have more summarised information and greater contact with the national grid, while the station manager's on-line information about the plant is presented on one or at the most two dials in his office which indicate station output. A responsibility chart can indicate not only decisions and duties but also the information needed to discharge these duties (Table 1. 1 5). Although it is usual to model responsibilities in terms of a hierarchical tree there are bound to be overlaps between what appear to be different levels of the hierarchy. These shared or duplicated responsibilities are unavoidable and often in fact are desirable because the process is one of mutual monitoring which usually improves reliability. Occasionally overlap may have the opposite effect due to the \\u2018falling between two stools\\u2019 phenomenon, two operators at the same level or at different levels may each assume that the other has taken a particular action which they both know is required. The remedy is adequate information feed-back and continuous checking but the need for this may not    be obvious from the chart because the areas of overlap are difficult to illustrate. It makes for much neater charting to assume that there are no overlaps but this defeats one of the main purposes of the chart. Hence the most comprehensive and useful charts often have many irregular comments, asterisks, footnotes, directing arrows and so on, which at first sight detract from the clarity of the presentation. Hierarchical Analysis . Tasks, in common with responsibilities, are susceptible to subdivision at different levels. A useful way of describing a complex task is to separate it into sub-tasks and further separate these sub-tasks into even smaller units. This provides a very clear picture of the total activity although the order of doing things may not be obvious. Such an hierarchical table (Fig. 1.28) can be supplemented by lists or sequences of operations which define a plan or a subroutine within a total task. Correspondingly, a tree or network of operations can define a pattern of decision-making. This technique, originally developed by Annett et al (1971), has been used extensively as a basis for training and retraining requirements (Duncan, 1975, Shepherd and Duncan, 1980), and also for the study of job satisfaction (Crawley and Spurgeon, 1979). For a particular system there may be many different but equally valid ways of separating tasks into sub-tasks depending on the relative emphasis on  training, interface design and other system design aspects. Sometimes a \\u2018bottom-up\\u2019 approach may be better than a \\u2018top-down\\u2019one. Protocol analysis . An operator carrying out a task can be asked to talk about what he is doing as he does it. Clearly this is useful for tasks which involve extensive scanning of information sources and deliberations about what action to take. The visible action may apparently be trivial \\u2014 adjusting one or two of very many available controls \\u2014 or may even be non-existent. This sort of task is very common in process control situations where the operator often makes a preliminary three-way decision corresponding to the worldwide system of red, amber and green traffic lights. That is, he does nothing, he does nothing at the moment but prepares for action, or he takes action. Because so much of the activity is in searching for information and processing it leading to a decision, the observed output is obviously a poor indicator of total activity and his verbal commentary is a much better guide to his task performance. Such a commentary can be recorded or notes can be taken directly by the analyst. The snag about recording is that an enormous amount of material is produced which is very tedious to analyse. The presentation of the result may use any of the charting methods described in this chapter, or may take the form of a descriptive narrative. M.C.I.Job-process analysis . Man-Computer Interaction has further complicated the relationship between human operators and other parts of a system but the computer can help to analyse these interactions. Tainsh (1985) has developed a technique in which a computer-based simulation of a generic information handling task is used to assist in analysing the behaviour of an operator or a team of operators. There are two V.D.U.s, one displaying alphanumeric data, the other graphical data. A group of operators (note, these are people with extensive experience of the same or similar tasks, not the unskilled  performer normally used in human performance experiments) run through a task using this equipment. Their behaviour and achievements are observed and discussed amongst themselves and with the analyst (Fig. 1.29). Conclusion Task analysis has not and cannot be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course. The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do. The danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance. The danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces, training courses and other operator aids. If a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task cannot be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being. Yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable. There is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system. As mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it. It is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of: \\u2018If I were doing the job this is how I would do it\\u2019, but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators. For analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative, but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience. A particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness. A task description which is part of a design process should be fully \\u2014 documented in terms of the origins of information, the assumptions made and the methods used. The standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network. There is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large, but often it is more useful to separate into small units with cross-referencing. The optimum size seems to be A3, this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail. The procedure can be computerised, there are programmes available for the easy production, manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities. There is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task  analysis is from the act of obtaining it. Those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description. Like reference books, they have to be used rather than read. Task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower, but in looking at cost/value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts the analysis. If such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the Delphi method rather than a long series of group meetings. Political, economic and social issues which arise in conducting Task Analyses are discussed in the context of Job Analysis (p. 148). Application Man-power planning The \\u2018Human Resource\\u2019 concept of man-power as the central profit-generating asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years. There was particular interest around 1970 when companies were prosperous, stable and innovative (IPM, 1972, Patten, 1971). The objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments, overheads in the form of heated, lighted, equipped workspaces and so on. From the narrow accountancy viewpoint, people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible. In these terms it is very difficult to justify, for example, sending a member of staff on a training course. The training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away. Where is the return? The return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use. There have been two attempts to reduce human resources to this form of measurement (Giles and Robinson, 1972). One is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff. The multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management. The other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments. The first does attempt to obtain a value, the second remains essentially a cost and not a value. It would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level such that costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value. A less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company. This can be very high, for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual. The most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight. For example, the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset. Indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known. Similarly, broad factors such as the state of morale will again only be described by negative features such as absenteeism, stoppages, strikes, low quality output and so on. It is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the man-power and its performance level, but, if this is acknowledged at all, it is only in brief verbal terms within, for example , the chairman's annual report. The obsession, of current management, with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation. Unfortunately there is no easy remedy. Human resources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades. Key variables such as the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive terms. It is generally accepted (p. 145) that \\u2018hygiene\\u2019 type variables such as pay and working conditions can, if they are inappropriately specified, depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters. Morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management. These factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference. for example, very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes. The result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms. The two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex. The age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information. For most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience. It also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced. Many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised, this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages. These comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move  out, this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in European countries and in Japan but much less so in the U.S.A. Stable work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable. This is particularly so in high technology e.g. design and construction of ships, aircraft, power stations and chemical plant, where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive. Some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants, but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation. In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements. Given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise. On the other hand, if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects. It is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties. This not only provides flexibility in the use of man-power, it also improves communication. These real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic. Size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems. For example, difficulties of communications and in particular , how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation. This is considered in more detail in Chapter 3. Human resources should be fundamental to subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through countries, regions and companies down to particular working systems. This is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions. The design of procedures The increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system (Fig. 1.30). Much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator. This takes three main forms: checklists, routines and knowledge-texts. The terminology in this field is not standardised. Software might be  restricted, as in this book, to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information. Procedures is sometimes used for what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator's information support except software. The situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based. Sometimes the term firm-ware is used. However whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort. The quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guide-lines (Table 1.16). Many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise    and style of thinking. Similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office. They may have to be read in the open air, in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily, cramped, poorly lit conditions. The user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions. The material on which the information is printed, the typeface used, the sequence, the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use,(Easterby and Zwaga, 1984). All these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use. Checklists Checklists are used in the pre-start mode, for routine maintenance and for fault-finding. They normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components. The sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which actions should be taken, for example in starting up an aircraft. There are many situations when the order is of no great consequence, for example a safety audit of a new machine, and in this latter case some logical structure is needed. As mentioned  above, the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different. Baker (1984) suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation. The operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks. Systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access, visibility and labelling. The checklist itself may be inconsistent, incomplete, imprecise or ambiguous. Finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical or horizontal structure, poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements, descriptions, remarks and tick-off points. The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in Edholm (1967). There is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content. The context is, of course, the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list. Routines A routine is the most common form of instructional material. The reader is required to follow a series of steps which might, for example, introduce a change in the performance of a complex system. Normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching. Each step should be simple and complete in itself \\u2014 preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved, for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light, or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material. As mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description. By definition and design intention routines are inflexible. The user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction. No great skill or intellectual effort is required, which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used, but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a step or reversing steps. In general the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator, left to himself, will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner. Knowledge texts Knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals. As instructional material it is indirect  in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do, as in a routine. Rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions. Nevertheless, the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected. It is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake. The \\u2018need to know\\u2019 criterion is crucial because unless it is applied, the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material. Correspondingly the material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used. In this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book. It is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically, systematically or at least in well-structured short paragraphs rather than in flowing prose. Consider for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets. Such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town. Note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another. A second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost, whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary. However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance (for a particular task) which is equally available. Thus, one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable. With two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers. See, for example, Fig. 5.3 Manuals which may contain maps, schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration. The design of manuals A manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer. It is part of the communication package from the designer to the user. Thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance. The standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several   reasons. For this purpose, the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know. Often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out, and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed. The problem is particularly acute for computers. Manuals for cars, machine tools and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions. Most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms, and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation. The computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual, at least in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions. He is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known. For most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in Table 1.17. The first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system, its purpose, its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits. This should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly. If it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it, fix it into position, connect it to power supplies and start it up. If it is large, the emphasis will be on the start up procedure. The section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it. Extensive use of line drawings, schematic  diagrams, algorithmic lists is desirable, and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs. The maintenance section should indicate what, if anything, the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required. Tables subdivided into Faults/Reasons/Remedies can be extremely helpful. Parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements. A standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses. A glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms. Finally, all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning. SKILL AND TRAINING Concepts. Development aspects Most laboratory and field studies of human behaviour involve taking a situational snap-shot at a given time in a given place. It is easy to overlook the continuously changing nature both of people and of work situations. When the skilled manager encounters what, on the face of it, is an intolerable set of work practices, attitudes and performance he does not necessarily take drastic action, he identifies the natural processes of change and accelerates them. In a remarkably short time changes in procedures, products and work-load, promotions, resignations, retirements and so on can transform any situation. The changes within an individual are even more inexorably continuous. Again it is easy to develop the illusion that a worker is a constant factor in a changing situation particularly for a person in the middle period of working life. This was encouraged by the traditional view of a skilled man as one who learned his trade by the age of 21 and thereafter practised it for more than forty years until he retired at 65. This was never the case and in the current working world it is even less so because of developing technology which has its impact on almost all jobs and also on the social context of work. For example, because of employment levels there is currently an emphasis on earlier retirement from and later entry into the working world. These trends are particularly marked in manufacturing industry where the work force is falling and the capital investment per worker is rising rapidly. For these reasons industry is moving towards a concept of the ideal worker as a physically fit adaptable young person. The labour force is becoming more like the military with the use of a limited age range and the screening out of anyone with any kind of disability who might not be able to work at a pace and with the flexibility and precision which will maintain the return on the very large capital investment. Even so, it remains true that the performance of the individual is a function of the way he developed skills in his earlier more formative years and the way in which his capacities and skills are still changing in the work environment. Human development can be described in terms of three attributes: capacities, skills and aspirations (Singleton, 198 1). The healthy, well-adapted individual keeps them in balance in a dynamic equilibrium. His natural endowment consists of a particular range of capacities: physical strength, mobility, vision, hearing, intellect and so forth. These form the basis for the development of a repertoire of skills dictated partly by capacities and partly by environmental circumstances such as the particular family, community and region he is born into and the available facilities for play, education and training. The balance and integration of capacities and skills is achieved by the third attribute of aspirations. These are partly determined by and partly determine the other attributes. The individual is in difficulties if his aspirations do not match his capacities and skills but most people are sufficiently realistic and have sufficient self-knowledge to keep these attributes in line. The most flexible attribute is the skills, these can be developed or changed in line with capacities and aspirations. A well-ordered civilisation demands standard basic skills of a physical kind: mobility and manipulation, and also of a mental kind: reading, writing and arithmetic. On the basis of these standard skills there is enormous flexibility for the individual to develop his own identity and to express it through his specialised skills. As the individual gets older, he continues to acquire new skills for two reasons. Firstly, the passage of time provides more and more experience and this is inevitably reflected in the skill repertoire. Secondly, the ageing individual suffers a steady diminution of capacities, for example the decrease in adaptability to lower lighting levels and the decrease in physical stamina. Skills develop and change to compensate partially for the changing capacities. It follows, of course, that decreasing capacities as such are not direct predictors of decreasing performance. This is true not only for ageing but also for the onset of disabilities (see Chapter 7). Human skill Skills are the residues of learning. To describe behaviour as skilled is to say no more than that it has been influenced by training and experience. There is often an implication that skilled means highly skilled although this connotation confuses the concept of existence and level. Unskilled is also used to imply a low level of skill rather than its absence. Level of skill is usually assessed in terms of extent of formal training although this is only one of the relevant factors: others include length of experience and degree of integration. Foundation skills are acquired in the first five years of life. These include not only perceptual-motor skills but also the basic language and social skills. Thereafter the educational system supplements the interaction with family and friends in providing facilities and exemplars for further symbolic and social   skill development. More details of all these skills are contained in Table 2.1. The specific skills which a person acquires whilst earning a living are combinations and developments of the standard skills of the normal healthy adult. This is not to denigrate the uniqueness and quality of working skills. They are of the underrated because the universal characteristic of high skill is that, to an observer, the performance does not appear to be very difficult. This is because the skilled individual is normally working well within his capacities, he does not have to search desperately for information because he knows exactly what to look for, his movements are not hurried because they are integrated into smooth chains and he does not react suddenly because he anticipates what is going to happen. In general, he works on the principle of minimal effort to achieve the required objectives in terms of both speed and quality. The importance of skill theory is that it relates human performance to systems concepts and to individual differences. The performer is pursuing an objective and the great variety of his activity has meaning in relation to his objective. Skill is a functional concept aimed at the understanding of how it is done without recourse to the detail of underlying physiological mechanisms. Individual differences are obviously a consequence of the particular past experience of each person who has thereby acquired a unique set of skills based on a natural endowment which was also unique. Skill theory also emphasises the closely integrated nature of behaviour in real situations, it is not readily susceptible to analysis into discrete components. The internal representation of a skill is called a schema. A schema is an  internal model which can be used to relate external events to a current purpose (Head 1920). It is modified continuously as external data is received and transformed into information. Schemata may be person centred or situation centred. For a more extensive discussion of schemata, how they differ and how they function, see Singleton (1981). Acquisition of skills Skills are acquired by a process of trial and error but the trials are not entirely random as is assumed in classical trial and error learning (Thorndike, 191 1). However, the more primitive the skill the more there must be an element of chance. For example, one of the skills developed in the first few years of life involves the integration of data arriving through the different sensory channels. The fact that a visually observed impact between two bodies in the physical world is normally associated with a particular sound has to be learned. Hence the importance of play in hitting, say, tins with spoons \\u2014 the visual, auditory and tactile impressions are being integrated. Similarly the kinaesthetic sensation of a limb moving has to be associated with the visual sensation obtained by observing the limb \\u2014 hence the countless hours which babies spend just watching their own limbs move. This is how manipulative skills begin, but it will be noted that even these are not purely \\u2018motor\\u2019, they are mainly \\u2018perceptual\\u2019. Greater precision is achieved by more definitive selection and guidance. Unskilled activity is to do everything rather than to do nothing. The concept of motor skill is associated, with the development of longer and more complex patterns of activity which can be reeled off following a single trigger and which are monitored on the basis that only feedback which indicates errors needs attention. Industrial training for manual operations is designed to encourage this kind of development (Seymour, 1966). Perceptual skills by contrast are developments to do with the greater selectivity of information needed to monitor situations and guide actions. These begin from an appreciation of the complementary nature of data arriving through the different sensory channels and expand by the acquisition of concepts such as the continuity of the physical world, e.g. a person who walks behind a screen has not vanished, it is accepted that he is still there even though temporarily there is no sense data to confirm it, but a hypothesis will be generated which supposes that, if he walked behind a screen at a constant speed, he ought to reappear at a given time at the other side of the screen. Similarly it is soon accepted that the \\u2018ostrich\\u2019 theory of closing one's eyes and assuming that thereby either oneself or things in the environment will actually disappear is not tenable. In this phase babies and young children enjoy \\u2018peep\\u2019 type games. There is an important stage at which the person-centred world is superseded or rather supplemented by the world of which the person is one part. Incidentally this is analogous to the distinction between displays which are \\u2018inside looking out\\u2019 and those which are \\u2018outside looking in\\u2019(p. 251). The perceptual system can function either way which is, of course, why each of the two types of display has its utility. This development is one utilising pictorial skills as distinct from enactive skills. The latter are based on the body, its extensions and images, the former are based on internal \\u2018pictures\\u2019 of the world which are one kind of schema or mental model (see next section). Social skills are in principle more complex than perceptual-motor skills because the latter assume (correctly) a passive world which will react neutrally, according to the laws of physics. In spite of occasional feelings to the contrary, usually described as good or bad luck, the physical world is neither for nor against the actions of the individual (except in the robotic sense of Le Chatilier's principle which states that whenever a constraint is placed on a system in equilibrium, the equilibrium is altered in such a way as to annul the efforts of the constraint). In social situations it has to be recognised that there is at least one other sentient being present who has his own objectives which might accord with or oppose those of the first person. Thus, social skills involve assessing the skills of the other person, a process known as mutual construing. The evidence about the constructs of another person is indirect and may have been deliberately obscured or falsified. Nevertheless, it is true for all skills that a person developing skills is indulging in a process of constructing models of what is happening externally. These models develop continuously while attempting to modify the external situation (physical or social). What seems to happen is that an individual, given his arrival in a situation, reviews it in the context of his own objectives and decides that if he takes certain actions, the situation will change in the direction of his objectives. He then takes the action, observes the changes and compares them with his stored version of those expected. If they correspond, then all is well, his concept of the situation is confirmed and he can progress to the next step in the context of his objectives. If, however, the observed changes are not what was predicted, then he has made an error but he has also learned because he must now modify his view of the situation accordingly. For example, I might decide the angle of light on my desk is not as I require it on the basis of assessing the illumination and the lamp which is the source of it. I hypothesise that if I move and turn the lamp in a particular way I will get the result I want. So I reach out, move and turn the lamp and check the result. If the result is as intended there has been no learning but equally none was needed because I understood the situation, I achieved my objective and I can move on to other  problems. In a more complex case I might sit in on a discussion within a committee but begin to consider that it is not moving in a direction that suits me. I therefore form a hypothesis about an appropriate contribution based on the proposition being considered, the associated facts and logic, the personalities of my fellow committee members and my own standing within the committee. I then state my proposition and observe its effects. If I get the result I wanted there is consolidation rather than extension of my committee skills, but if I do not get the result I wanted then I have learned something and I form a new hypothesis about my next interjection strengthened by this new learning. It will be noted that errors are the basis of further skill acquisition. Facilitating the acquisition of skill is a matter of providing situations where the skill can be practised with adequate, sometimes enhanced, feedback so that there can be learning from mistakes. The necessary conditions for learning are feedback and motivation, the result of actions must matter to the individual. All this is quite generally true, it applies equally to motor skills, perceptual skills and social skills. Mental models The principles of perception indicate that the human operator does not react unambiguously to stimuli which arrive via the sensory mechanisms (p. 196). To assume that he responds directly to data from the real world is to oversimplify the relationship between his inputs and outputs. The skill model described above implies that, except in highly restricted artificial situations, his information processing must be described in terms of patterns of stimuli related to patterns of responses. It is also true that responses are a function of enormous differences between and within individuals. To encompass all these parameters, it is currently fashionable to describe the person as responding in terms of his mental model of the situation rather than to the situation itself. The idea is that any person in any situation builds an internal model of the situation which is being reported to him, as it were, by sensory data. He uses each perceptual datum to update his model of the situation. The model is his picture of what is going on outside him and it is essentially an hypothesis based on the available evidence. This theory explains nicely why he sometimes does not react in tune with his own interests, that is, he gets it wrong. In these circumstances he is considered to have developed a model which does not bridge the gap between reality and his aspirations. These models are most easy to visualise in pictorial terms \\u2014 the human operator has his internal picture which topographically matches the real world. Models can, however, be simpler than these and can take the form of rules or they can be more complex in that symbolism can be used. Thus a model  can be entirely abstract using symbols which have no pictorial quality as in the use of language and mathematics. Even when a picture is used, it is not complete, it takes the form of an icon which contains what the perceiver considers matters at the time. For example, a person working in a room with or without other people can easily develop the misconception that he has a complete picture in his mind of the physical environment. In fact the picture is complete only in the sense that it contains the details which are relevant to his activity in that room, it certainly does not contain all the detail which is available to the senses. This is readily demonstrated by asking him to close his eyes and answer questions such as\\u2018is there a picture on the wall on the left?\\u2019 or \\u2018what colour are the eyes of the person you are talking to?\\u2019 This is the kind of data which is not relevant to his objectives and thus it is not recorded in his model. On the other hand he will be able to answer questions such as\\u2018is the door behind you to the left or to the right?\\u2019 because he has used that door and needs to use it again. He knows where it is even though he cannot currently see it. Thus the visually-based mental picture is invariably an icon in the literal sense of a \\u2018symbolic representation\\u2019 rather than a complete reproduction. At a more abstract level the mathematician or scientist will perform manipulations within a set of symbols which follow certain rules but neither the symbols nor the rules need have direct representation in reality. Indeed any attempt to relate them prematurely to reality may restrict the development of the model. However, at some stage he will return to reality and say, for example, \\u2018what this means in practice or in terms of my next experiment\\u2026\\u2019 The skilled thinker has an extraordinary facility not only to develop varieties of abstract models but also to switch rapidly between them and between them and reality. The switching takes place up and down a hierarchy of abstraction and generality. Consider for example the maintenance engineer operating as a diagnostician. He will look at a piece of equipment to try to detect signs which indicate what is wrong. Is there a gap or a hole which indicates a leak? Is there a part which is too hot? Most of this information comes not so much from what is happening but from what is not happening. Basically the thing is not working as it should, the outputs are not as they should be so he will probably begin by checking that the inputs are present, that is the electric power or fuel or other materials are available. He will then envisage the designed chain of events between input and output and look for the hiatus, he may do this by rules, by a pictorial model or by a model involving some symbolism such as expected voltage levels. He will shift very rapidly between different representations of the equipment; the thing itself, his maintenance instructions, the manual, the drawings of the system, verbal discussion with a colleague, his recollection of  what has happened to it in the past and so on. He may think in terms of bits of equipment, flows of material, flows of energy or flows of information. He will shift through levels of generality and levels of abstraction until he has formulated an hypothesis which takes the form of \\u2018if I do this \\u2014 that should happen\\u2019. He will then perform an action and check its results. There are many interesting facets of this complex diagnostic process and three are worthy of re-emphasis: firstly most of his information comes not from positive signals, stimuli or cues but from their absence, secondly he is relying on a hybrid model \\u2014 a mixture of rules, mental pictures and symbolism, thirdly it all happens without very much conscious guidance \\u2014 one mental or physical event leads to another and each event in the chain plays its part before handing over to the next one. There is some analogy with a control system used in early naval warfare. There was not one ship permanently in command, the particular ship in most direct contact with the enemy was in command until the leading position was taken over by another ship which then assumed command as well as action. The working situation is different from the training school and even more from the educational system. However it does seem that mental models can be developed in the abstract without the need to resort to action, in other words it is possible to learn while sitting passively in a class-room. Education or abstract learning does seem to take the form mainly of symbolic modelling and the relating of these models to reality awaits later practical experience. The great asset of symbolic modelling is just this, learning does not have to depend entirely on practice and it is possible for collective knowledge to accumulate. This knowledge is communicated between people by the use of shared models. Conversely, abstract communication cannot take place without the development of appropriate models. For example, the technical teacher is trying to convey various models to his pupils, some of the models will be physically based as in describing particular machines or systems and some will be functionally based as when he talks about thermodynamics or communication. What the teacher is trying to do is to guide each pupil into developing a set of mental models which have been found by experience or experiment to be useful in understanding technical processes. Having developed these models the pupil is in a position to communicate much more readily with other technical people who can manipulate similar models. Conversely, this communication between specialists will be incomprehensible to those who do not have the expertise which resides in this particular set of models. Even between technical peers as in a design team there can be difficulties in communication because the models which individuals are using are not identical. Debate, demonstration and other communications take place until a common modelling is accepted. When there is disagreement, there is much to be said for retreating specifically to consider the model rather than the problem. Correspondingly, when there is a complex situation to discuss there can be considerable dividends in attempting to get an agreed model \\u2018on the table\\u2019 before considering specific issues. This is what briefing sessions are intended to accomplish. This approach also explains why engineers and ergonomists sometimes have difficulties in reaching agreement. The former is likely to be using mechanism-based models with people as ancillaries while the ergonomist will be using models of people with mechanisms as ancillaries. For good cooperation it is essential that the engineer has some grasp of ergonomics and that the ergonomist understands at least in general terms the technical situation in the particular industry. There can of course still be disagreements even when there is clear mutual understanding because underlying values result in the assessment of very different priorities. In summary, communication, whether between a person and the physical world or between people, involves each person in developing and manipulating a mental model by interacting with the situation. Modelling the physical world and modelling other people's models share the same developmental procedures. Understanding what a person is doing requires an appreciation of the kind and content of the models that that person holds. Knowledge Individual differences Capacities, abilities and aptitudes It is useful to discriminate between a capacity which is a natural endowment and an ability which is a competence to act. A capacity relates to an ability through an intervening phase of education, training and experience. Thus an ability represents what a person can do now, whereas a capacity is essentially a potential. An aptitude is demonstrated by success in learning which results in the acquisition of an ability. An aptitude is therefore a capacity plus an inclination or interest. Ability and skill are often used interchangeably although ability is the wider term. An ability is made up of a repertoire of skills and is thus a higher level skill. Ability and capacity are often confused for several reasons. Human resources might be expressed in terms of either since capacities can be transformed into abilities by training. Strictly we can only measure abilities but much psychometric testing aims to infer capacities from the measured abilities, e.g. intelligence tests. All three terms are attributes of individuals intended to describe their distinction from other individuals. All are used loosely because there are no  taxonomies which are either comprehensive or rigorous. That is, it would be unduly ambitious to claim to be able to describe a complete range of human abilities and the descriptors used for particular abilities are not always separable. The same is true for capacities and aptitudes. The best known attempt to provide a comprehensive structure of human abilities is that due to Guilford (1967). His model contains about 120 different abilities, it is not currently very popular with psychometricians. The only unambiguous categorisations of people are by physical size, age and sex. None of these is uniquely related to abilities but nevertheless age and sex are useful parameters. Age in particular at least correlates with some of the parameters which affect choice of work and performance at work. Intelligence and personality There is no agreed definition of intelligence although a century of experience has accumulated in attempts to measure it (Friedman et al ., 1981). Intelligence defined as that which is measured by intelligence tests is obviously circular and also variable as the fashions in intelligence testing change. For example, the attempt in the past thirty years to incorporate more divergent factors changes the emphasis towards inductive and creative abilities. This supplements the consideration of deductive and logical abilities measured by the traditional convergent questions for which there are unique correct answers. In spite of the absence of a sound theory, the concept is operationally useful. Intelligence is a descriptor of the quality of mental functioning, the ceiling of intellectual manipulation to which the individual can rise. High achievers in technically demanding fields are always intelligent although the converse is not true. That is, there are many intelligent individuals who are not high achievers. It follows that a particular score from an intelligence appraisal can be a useful cut-off point in that those who do not attain the cut-off should not be expected to cope with the demands of the particular task. However, a high score does not necessarily predict success in a high level job. The intelligence test can be a useful source of evidence about individuals who are considered for lower level jobs. For more senior jobs individuals will have already demonstrated an appropriate level of intelligence by their educational standards and successful work experience. In line with the principles of defining the relevant abilities in terms of reliable test measures, intelligence can be divided into verbal ability, arithmetical ability, reasoning ability and spatial ability. For more extensive discussion see Eysenck (1979). There is a long established distinction in psychology between cognitive and conative aspects of behaviour. Cognition is to do with the rational domain: logic, reasoning and problem solving uncomplicated by irrational behaviour. Conation is to do with the emotional domain: feeling, caring and striving. Intelligence is connected with cognition but personality incorporates conation. Thus Freudian theory is regarded as a personality theory. Clearly if we wish to describe the whole person conative aspects must be included. Unfortunately personality testing is much less well developed than intelligence testing. The best known personality tests are the Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (M.M.P.I.), Catell's test (16 P.F.), and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (E.P.I.). For details see Kline (1976). These are self-report inventories where the testee has the possibility of cheating in that he can respond with an answer which he considers will give him a good score rather than providing a completely truthful one. Such manipulation of answers is less feasible with projective tests where the testee is asked to respond to a highly ambiguous situation and his response is presumed to reflect his personality as well as the situation. The presentation might be a picture (thematic apperception test), an ink-blot (Rorschach test) or prose (sentence completion test). The difficulty about using these tests is how to score the responses with any reasonable hope of reliability let alone validity. There are other tests which relate indirectly to personality, namely interest tests. Here the testee is presented with a set of questions or checklists which steer him into trying to think carefully about his own interests. The best known ones are the Kuder Preference test and the Strong-Campbell interest inventory. They are particularly useful in occupational guidance (Nelson-Jones 1982). Age differences The extremes of the age range, children and old people, are outside the scope of this book. The working age range is 15 to 65 years. This is not to suggest that those outside this range never work, but rather that in advanced countries gainful employment is considered to be mainly the responsibility of those in this particular age band of 50 years. This band is currently contracting even further in European societies. Because of the rise in unemployment it is now becoming standard that almost all those in the 15\\u201318 age range are in education or training schemes and retirement is increasingly common from 55 years upwards, particularly from manufacturing industry. Nevertheless, from both physiological and psychological viewpoints, ageing is regarded as a continuous process so that considerable changes can be expected between 1 8 and 55 years. Using the information processing model of receptor, central and effector processes (Welford, 1958; Birren and Schaie, 1977), changes occur in all these processes. The receptors diminish in  efficiency: there are consistent changes in visual acuity and changes in sensitivity to light, the threshold of hearing increases particularly for higher frequencies. The effector processes become slower and less powerful but these effects are not so marked or so consistent. The main change in central processes seems to be decreased short-term memory which results in performance which is less rapid and more deliberate; measured intelligence falls slightly but not very much within the working age range. This may seem to be a gloomy picture but it must be noted that, in relation to work, age is not a large aspect of individual differences compared with natural endowment, and that increases in ability can more than compensate for small decreases in capacity. Wellord (1979) suggests that work on the shop-floor is likely to peak in the thirties \\u2014 those in their twenties lack experience and social skills, those in their forties are beginning to notice the effect of sensory changes and are less tolerant of fast or very heavy physical work. On the other hand, from the forties onwards there is likely to be greater stability in the sense that individuals are more settled in their jobs and ambitions and are supported by less rapidly changing domestic and leisure situations. The effectiveness of training can be maintained if the training scheme incorporates features such as smaller learning steps and \\u2018discovery learning\\u2019 where the trainee proceeds at his own pace using his own strategies (Belbin 1965). For more senior positions there are more subtle attributes such as self-knowledge and the ability to see \\u2018the big picture\\u2019 which increase with age, these are the reasons why most institutions and societies rely on older leaders (Singleton, 1983b). Sex differences There is surprisingly little research on the differences in work performance which are traceable to sex differences, and the situation is complicated in many countries by the inclusion of sex as one of the variables where discrimination is legally inadmissible. Incidentally, in this book \\u2018man\\u2019, \\u2018he\\u2019 and \\u2018him\\u2019are used as generic terms covering both sexes. There can be no argument that, on average, women are physically smaller than men, and there are other features such as the greater proportion of fatty tissue which give men the advantage in relation to tolerance of heat stress and physical effort involving fast or heavy work or awkward posture. On the other hand in Russia, for example, where so many males were lost in two world wars women do do much heavier work than is traditional in Western countries. Similarly there seem to be many cultures in tropical countries where the women get on with the necessary work while the men sit around discussing matters. There appear to be no important differences in performance on intelligence tests in the working age range and as the influence of physical effort in work becomes less important so it is more feasible that jobs can be performed equally well by either sex. The overall situation was reviewed by Hoiberg (1982). Equal opportunity legislation exists in most advanced countries but this is not yet reflected in equal pay rates. The average wage of women workers is two-thirds that of men. Part-time work seems to be a prerogative of women presumably as a consequence of their central role in the home. Educational opportunity varies, depending mainly on family attitudes. In some cultures sons are given priority, others give daughters priority, following the McIver principle \\u2018when you educate a man you educate an individual: when you educate a woman you educate a whole family\\u2019. Ethics, cultural, climatic and economic differences This is a sensitive topic on which to conduct research or establish principles with the consequence that, in spite of the extensive effort (Triandis et al ., 1980) there is not a great deal of knowledge established beyond argument. Climate and economics need to be included because these factors may well determine features which at first sight might be attributed to ethnic or cultural factors. Clearly the work that people do is determined by the level of technology which is related to overall wealth. Ways of working and locations of work are also affected by climate. For example, in a tropical country shoes may still be made in the open air by a craftsman who uses his feet as well as his hands to hold and manipulate materials. In a temperate country shoes are made in a factory by workers who are process controllers rather than craftsmen, and they touch the materials only when loading or unloading machines. For these and many other reasons the practice of ergonomics in developing countries is different from that in advanced countries (p. 155). The acquisition of skills is governed by the current needs of particular societies and by the adaptation of individuals within the societies in which they happen to find themselves. Research on the influence of cultural factors on intelligence testing and test results have been conducted on a wide scale and the results are endlessly discussed because of the inextricable mixture of technical and value judgments. As Crombach puts it in the foreword to Irvine and Berry (1981)\\u2018the progress is as much in the psychology of the investigators as in the investigations being reported\\u2019. As in other fields of behavioural study there are three phases. In the first phase techniques and theories are developed in the West. In the second phase Western practitioners try out their ideas in other cultures and many new insights emerge by comparisons and contrasts, in particular it becomes clear that some of the principles thought to be valid for \\u2018man\\u2019 turn out to be valid only for man in Western cultures. In the third phase scientists from other cultures acquire these concepts, develop them further in their indigenous environment and provide penetrating comments on Western ideas and their application from an external viewpoint (Crombach and Drenth, 1972). The dominant influence of culture on the direction of human development implies that descriptions of human abilities cannot be context free. Specific cultures are themselves dynamic, in particular they change under the influence of technology. Ergonomics cannot be simply the adaptation of technology to suit invariant properties of \\u2018man\\u2019, people change with technology. Learning Learning has been a major topic within academic psychology for the past century or so. The nineteenth century work of Pavlov on the conditioned reflex generated vain hopes that psychology, and in particular learning, might be studied by a rigorous methodology closely allied to physiology. It was assumed that all learning could be reduced to a series of conditioned reflexes. There was extensive research in this behaviourist tradition (Hilgard and Marquis, 1940) mostly on the laboratory rat. So called verbal learning in man was studied by a similar process of scoring repetitive performance. Reliance on such data produced the systematic behaviour theories of Thorndike, Hull and Skinner. There was a parallel although less popular theoretical development based on Gestalt psychology which resulted in the field theories of Lewin, Wheeler and Tolman (Hilgard, 1948). There were many attempts to devise taxonomies of learning which used particular theories as descriptive of different kinds of learning (Melton, 1964). At this stage there seemed to be little connection between the vast experience of learning in practice within educational and training systems and learning as conceived by psychologists on the basis of laboratory experiments. The psychologists attempted to polarise various issues such as massed versus spaced learning, whole versus part learning and transfer of training which had some face validity in appearing to identify general principles, but in practice it always seemed that the generalities vanished into the enormous variety of specific issues. The answer always differed with the particular situation. Gagne (1970) attempted to produce a theory which was germane to educational problems by switching the emphasis from categories to conditions of learning. The deliberate attempt to link learning to the design of instruction provided the necessary discipline to treat learning as a practical as well as a theoretical issue. The eight types of learning which Gagne distinguishes are shown in Table 2.2. Gagne also separated four   phases of a learning sequence; apprehension, acquisition, storage and retrieval. The apprehension phase includes attending and perceiving, that is accepting new information. Acquisition is not easy to separate from either apprehension on one side or storage on the other, but it implies that learning has taken place in that something new can now be done if appropriate. The distinction from apprehension is necessary to incorporate the phenomenon that it is possible to understand a situation in one sense without knowing what to do about it. Correspondingly acquisition is different from storage in that the latter implies a formal recording possibly in short-term or possibly in long-term memory. Finally retrieval is a separate process because of another familiar phenomenon that it is possible to know something, that is it must be in storage, but not actually succeed in retrieving it at a particular time. These phases and the difficulties of separating them reflect the fact that mental processes are not subject to clearly defined distinctions and boundaries. In common with all educational psychologists Gagne is also restricted by reliance on evidence which comes mostly from laboratory experiments, usually on lower animals, with all the limitations and artefacts which this implies. More subtly he is also restricted by attempting to set the knowledge in another artificial situation, the educational process of sitting in classrooms learning by rote leavened by some understanding and being examined and tested in standardised situations. Thomas and Harri-Augstein (1985) attempt a more autonomous approach to learning in two senses. That is, learning need not be restricted to the  orthodox educational system and also that learning, as a process, is essentially self-centred, and self-organised. This approach follows the tradition of Rogers (1951) who developed client-centred therapy and Kelly (1955) who developed personal construct theory. The emphasis is on the individual who inevitably has a unique view of the world which he continuously modifies in the light of experience. Each view of the world can be described using personal constructs which can be elicited by the use of a Repertory Grid. The individual reflects on his own experience and is thus continuously involved in both internal and external conversations. Learning takes place as a result of these conversations. Traditional distinctions between teaching, training and therapy disappear, so also does the conceptual distinction between cognition and conation. One attractive aspect of this theory is that it highlights the way in which formal instruction can inhibit learning by not allowing sufficient scope for self-expression and self-development \\u2014 alienation following submission to being taught rather than learning how to learn. The emphasis on self does not limit the application to individual activity, shared meaning can be negotiated and developed within groups, this is group learning. Correspondingly the teacher is not redundant, a competent teacher is a learning manager and so also is every parent, manager or counsellor, their task is to provide the conditions and facilitate the process of self-development. If learning is defined as the improvement of specific performance following experience of that performance then organisations as well as individuals can be said to learn. Paradoxically much of the more abstract work on the mathematical theory of learning curves has its application at least in principle in the requirements of accountants and production engineers. The process of making anything from a switch to a civil airliner is subject to improvements in speed, quality and cost reduction which follow the characteristic learning curve. It is obviously important to the managers of such organisations to be able to predict by how much the process will improve after particular lengths of time and numbers of products made. Conversely, because of the universal very steep learning curves with early experience, any novel enterprise is bound to have extensive teething troubles, which should be allowed for in general even though they are not predictable in particular. Experiments, trials, prototypes and the running in parallel of old and new systems are all valuable, almost essential procedures \\u2014 when something radical is being attempted on any scale from a new car suspension to a new educational system. Technology and society generally is continuously in trouble because this elementary principle is forgotten or ignored by enthusiastic innovators. Memory and thinking Thinking is essentially an internal activity although of course it is stimulated and aided by interaction with the external world including other people. Since it takes place \\u2018inside\\u2019 it must be related to memory. This is one of several complications of the simplistic view that memory is just a store. Another is that a store is useless without means of access and egress. In other words there must be processes of recording and retrieval and the underlying mechanisms must be closely integrated with the mechanism of the store. The store or stores are almost certainly active rather than passive records of events and knowledge so that these also are best considered as processes. Early studies of memory by psychologists concentrated on apparatus such as the memory drum which was used to measure the ability to associate verbal items. In the pursuit of generality these items were often nonsense syllables. This is another example of the way in which the attempt to standardise human performance can negate the purpose of study. There is a built-in assumption that memory is about association and a removal of any possibility of demonstrating that memory might be dependent on meaning. Other early studies of memory attempted to measure capacity by data such as the length of a number series which could be accurately reproduced after one presentation. The answer turns out to be about seven (Woodworth, 1938). These studies of immediate memory span are of more than historical interest because the fact that there is such a severe limit is important in the design of information presentations of technical data \\u2014 a standard ergonomics problem. Other significant phenomena which have emerged from such studies are that simple reversals of the numbers are a common form of error, accurate reproduction is facilitated by deliberate grouping in twos or threes and the ends of a span seem to be less prone to error than the middle. With the advent of information theory (Attneave, 1959; Edwards, 1964) other interesting issues arose such as whether the performance of the store could better be measured in terms of bits of information or chunks of material (the bits-versus-chunks controversy (Miller, 1956)) and the possibility that memory processes might distinguish between content and order. The simple memory span measure confounds these variables. Clearly there is more to memory than the reproduction of numbers or lists and another distinction which has arisen is between episodic and semantic memory. The former is concerned with specific events and the latter is relatively context free (Baddeley, 1976). A parallel but not identical distinction is between short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory has capacity limits and is readily purged, it probably keeps a record of the current situation, whereas the long-term memory is the repository of principles and strategies. Both these distinctions imply that registration in storage continues long past the time of reception of information. Whether or not this implies shifting to different stores is not known. In functional terms there do seem to be storage facilities relatively near the entry channels through the senses, those for the visual and auditory systems are called respectively the iconic store and the echoic store (Wickens, 1984). These stores have available a literal record of the stimulus so that the observer can, as it were, internally inspect them but such impressions decay very rapidly, typically in less than ten seconds. In an elegant series of experiments Conrad (1964) demonstrated that in transposing visually presented data the errors are more likely to be in numbers or letters of similar sound rather than those which are of similar appearance. This suggests that this short-term store is  auditorily rather than visually based even when the task is visual-motor. The effect diminishes if there is irrelevant articulatory activity at the time, this raises the possibility that there may be pre-output stores as well as post-input stores, almost literally memory in the fingers. If an experienced operator of a complex console of switches is asked where a particular switch is he will often touch it and check what he has touched, the action precedes the recall and recall precedes recognition. The distinction between recall and recognition is clearly an important one, in that the human memory is so much superior in the latter function. We may be totally unable to recall an event or a fact but recognise it and all its context immediately if it is presented. Again there seems to be a distinction between what and when. Any busy person will recall that he has a particular engagement but will have only a sparse internal record of when this commitment will arise, hence the importance of a diary. If asked to recall a date such a person will proceed by inference rather than by a direct introspective search, e.g. \\u2018it cannot be next week but it must be within the next month\\u2019 or \\u2018this kind of event is always on a Tuesday\\u2019and so on. This is one illustration of the process which Bartlett (1932) called \\u2018turning round on one's own schemata\\u2019\\u2014\\u2018I am in this state therefore this must be so\\u2019 rather than the direct retrieval from a store. In Bartlett's view long-term memory involves the reconstruction of events, such remembering is subject to bias and distortion not only from  idiosyncrasy but also from the context and even the culture. It is in this sense that memory is a consequence of the continuously modified record of experience (p. 100) rather than a separate function. The analogy of the ego or self, the internal little man consulting personal records is attractive but misleading. One dubious consequence is that the short-term memory, of limited capacity compared with the virtually infinite  capacity of long-term memory, is conceived as the internal stage on which exhibits from the store are manipulated. This is one view of thinking but again it is thinking restricted by the limitations of the laboratory situation where the problem must be easily assimilated and the proposed solution is readily measurable. Psychological research on thinking has been the province of the field theorists, in particular the gestalt psychologists (Humphrey, 1951). There was considerable debate within this school about the overlapping concepts of motive, determining tendency and set. Some such concept is required to explain why different individuals reach different solutions in diagnosing and providing remedies for particular situations. These ideas have recently been revived by the concept of \\u2018mind-set\\u2019 to describe why errors are made in coping with complex system failures. Craik (1943) considered that thinking paralleled reality in that within the mind there must be a model of reality which can be manipulated independently of the outside world. The advantages of such a mechanism are clear, it is possible to manipulate the model and thus understand the outside world in the sense of predicting what will happen without the potential costs of attempting to manipulate the real world and allowing things to happen, some of which might be considered to be unfortunate. Using technology, this process can now be partially externalised in that, for example, a simulation of a situation can be run in parallel with a real situation and can be manipulated independently of what happens in real time. Bartlett (1958) regarded thinking as a form of skill in that it has the characteristics of organising information. A situation can be structured and comprehended so as to indicate a direction for proceeding. In technological situations there is often also a timing characteristic, evidence is developing and at some point in the future, which itself has to be determined, something will have to be done. One attribute of thinking as opposed to perception is that the evidence is relatively less complete, gaps have to be filled either within or beyond the available data. This is achieved on the basis of past experience and interests. Inevitably the product of thinking is a function of the thinker as well as of the situation. Past experience is brought to bear on a new situation by a categorisation, a process regarded as central to thinking by Bruner and his colleagues (1956). Classification must be a function not only of the situation but also of the existing internalised classes and their relative accessibility. Bruner (1957) discusses the classical problem of determining tendency as \\u2018perceptual readiness\\u2019 and notes also the problem that the first classification can mask a more appropriate classification. This relates to a currently important limitation in fault diagnosis for technological systems where a first hypothesis about the cause of the problem can inhibit flexibility in considering other possible causes. The above ideas were generated mainly on the basis of experiments and it is not surprising that many of the key characteristics of thinking in real situations were not given sufficient weight. These include the use of evidence arising from the absence of events rather than their presence, the cost-effectiveness criterion in pursuing evidence and reasoning processes based on extensive experience rather than intellectual analysis. More recent work on observation of, rather than experiment with thinking (Johnson-Laird and Wason, 1977) goes some way to restoring the balance in appraising all the relevant parameters in a real situation where thinking is taking place. There is also a dearth of evidence about thinking by groups. This is surprising in view of the time which people spend in committees, task forces and the like. There is experimental work on issues such as kinds of group organisation, e.g. autocratic versus democratic versus laissez-faire (Sherif, 1948) and on the group dynamics of people interactions (Lewin, 1935) but little work on the process of problem solving by groups. The collective mind in action is clearly an important topic but it seems to be a challenge which psychologists have not yet taken up. It is important in education as well as in gainful employment (Singleton, 1983a). Language There has been extensive work on the psychology of language (Campbell and Smith, 1976; Gerver and Sinaiko, 1978), but with a greater emphasis on language as an interpersonal communication vehicle rather than language as a supporter of thinking. The work of Piaget (1950) and Chomsky (1957) is essentially about thinking and language or psycholinguistics, but these authors did not concern themselves with the level of problem which arises when, for example, a physiologist and a psychologist attempt to exchange mutually supportive ideas. Herriot (1970, 1974), however, makes some interesting suggestions about the relationship between language, schema, strategies and deep structure. As he sees it, deep structure is represented in schemata which relate non-linguistic and linguistic thinking. Language and indeed behaviour generally is necessarily ordered and is represented internally as strategies, schemata are not inherently sequential and thinking can thus be concerned with context before the constraint of achieving is introduced in order to generate an output. Thinking regarded as internal manipulation of events and ideas does not necessarily depend on language, but if it is not entirely ego orientated, that is not concentrated on the relationship of the person to the scheme of things, then it usually invokes iconic representation. Designers of computer based support for thinking beyond the level of merely providing additional information will  hopefully begin to simultaneously use and develop these ideas. Effective computer support must be matched to human thinking so that communication is readily established and yet different in providing functions which supplement human thinking (p. 233). Learning and memory The learner must have the drive to learn and he must also have knowledge of the results of his activities. 1. Behaviour at a higher skilled level is characterised by selectivity in choice of inputs and outputs and by increasing influence of the past and the future rather than the immediate situation. 2. Learning is an activity of an individual, no one else can do it for him. Educators and trainers can do no more than provide the conditions, the content and the materials. 3. Social skills and communication generally depend on the detection and definition of mutually agreed internal models of reality. 4. The human memory, in common with every other store, has to be positively consulted before it will function. This is not a limitation, it is essential for coherent behaviour, there would be chaos if material emerged without prompting. The trigger is usually some external stimulus, not necessarily an obvious one. It might be a particular smell, a particular melody or a brief glimpse of a person resembling one of the actors in an event which is then recalled. This facility for associations which are neither obvious nor apparently logical is extremely valuable in creative thinking and problem solving. The converse of positively trying to recall some fact such as the name of a person is subject to curious blockages which are not understood. 5. Given the alternative of storage internally in the mind or externally in a file (paper-based or computer-based) external records are much superior for literal reproductions at least in western societies (there is anecdotal evidence concerning illiterate traders in other cultures who seem to have remarkable memories for detailed facts and numbers connected with their personal business). The capacity and flexibility of desk-top computers is now such that the optimal sharing of processing, storage and presentation of material between computer and operator may well be quite different from the traditional combination of human memory and material on paper. This topic is too recent for there to be many guidelines available but for a particular topic the designer can assume that he need not be inhibited in allowing his imagination to run to many kinds of novel solutions. 6. There is a considerable art in developing the most effective combination of external and internal stores and reminders which every highly skilled person  deliberately cultivates. For example, there is no need to write in a diary \\u2018check in-tray and consult secretary\\u2019, these actions take place as routine following  arrival at the office. On the other hand a diary entry such as\\u2018ring X\\u2019 is effective and if the entry is some way in the future it may be necessary to amplify with a trigger of the form \\u2018ring X re Y\\u2019and to have easily accessible some factual data such as the X telephone number and some data re Y. In a different context a car driver will develop a strategy to ensure that he does not run out of petrol, he may rely on a light which appears when the tank is nearly empty or he may calculate from his expected travelling that he need not concern himself about the issue until at least the next weekend, or he may programme himself to react to the fact that he is approaching a particular garage. This self-programming goes on continuously with an implicit acknowledgment of the need for triggers and the relative advantages of various kinds of stores and stored materials. 7. This self-organised work design has its parallel in designing tasks for others. In studying an elaborate sequence of events within a task the designer will systematically consider the need for appropriate triggers for the memory at specific points in the task. In particular he will never rely on the operator spontaneously remembering to do something which has no natural place in the developing task (p. 56). 8. There are at least three and probably many more levels of storage. The sensory stores decay very rapidly, items are lost in less than ten seconds. The short-term store has a limit of about twenty seconds unless there is opportunity for rehearsal, e.g. this is the maximum time available between looking up a telephone number and then dialling it unless the operator repeats it to himself. Some kinds of long-term memory seem to endure indefinitely even though they have apparently been lost for a long time, e.g. an older person may find it easy to recall childhood events with great clarity even though there has been no use of the material for fifty or sixty years. 9. There seems to be a memory for elaborate patterns and sequences which takes a long time to develop. For example a chemist will learn about compounds by laboriously memorising as a student the properties of each one separately but eventually sets of compounds are perceived as a pattern and thereafter all the relevant material is readily available because it fits together neatly. The corollary for the trainer is to look for patterns which exist in complex material and introduce the trainee to the patterns as well as to the separate facts. Similarly an information presentation will be more readily comprehended if there is a detectable structure such as the \\u2018christmas tree\\u2019 method of working through a checklist. 10. Errors in recall can be similar for different individuals. for example the propensity for simple reversals within a number sequence. It follows that attempting to reduce error rates by one person checking another's performance or automatically comparing the output of the individuals simultaneously performing the same task is not as effective as it would be if errors in the sources were independent (Chapanis et al ., 1949). Principles, methods and procedures Interviewing An interview is a formal conversation in which there is a non-reciprocal relationship between the parties. It is formal in that there are purposes which define the reasons why the transaction is taking place. There is conversation which is usually face to face but may sometimes involve telecommunication. It is non-reciprocal in that the two parties are never equivalent; one is the interviewer who has the initiative, the other is the interviewee. The interviewing party may be a group facing one interviewee, e.g. a selection board. The interviewed party may be a group facing one interviewer, e.g. a group of witnesses facing a reporter. Any transaction involving two groups or two equivalent individuals is regarded as a negotiation rather than an interview. The interview can be initiated by either side, e.g. by the interviewer when a more senior person calls a subordinate or by the interviewee when a patient calls a doctor. The information transmission will inevitably be two-way but the main purpose may be transmission from interviewer to interviewee as in an appraisal interview, from interviewee to interviewer as in an opinion survey, or it may change direction during the course of the interview as in a patient-doctor interview. In this last case the interviewee begins by providing information which facilitates a diagnosis and the interviewer thereafter provides information about possible causes and remedies. In view of the universality and range of the interview situation it is not surprising that there has been extensive research, but for the same reasons the research is of little operational consequence. Checks of interview effectiveness by, for example, having the same list of candidates ranked independently by two selection boards invariably indicates rather poor consistency. On the other hand no manager willingly accepts a new member of staff without the use of a selection interview, no doctor will express a confident diagnosis without an interview with the patient, and no counsellor could function without meeting his clients face to face. The key to the issue is that interviews except in the simplest case of surveys, to be discussed later, are not about acquiring factual evidence. This is best obtained by asking interviewees to complete standard forms or to take tests before or between interviews. Information obtained  during an interview is about assessable but unquantifiable attributes such as attitudes, motivation, reliability, integrity, social ease and so on. In skill terminology the interviewer uses the interview to create a model in his mind which he can use to predict the behaviour of the individual interviewee in a work situation, a stress situation, an illness or whatever an interview is about. Obviously he can create a better model if he knows what the interviewee looks like, how he dresses, talks and responds non-verbally. Equally the interviewee forms a model of the interviewer(s) and this can be a considerable aid to his decision-making about whether he can respect, trust, work with or tolerate guidance from the interviewer. This interaction may or may not achieve a successful conclusion for both sides depending on their level of skill. Attempting to do research on the interview per se is doomed to failure because the skills of the actors will dominate the success or otherwise of the proceedings. It should be remembered also that the interview is only one incident within a series of communication functions which aim towards one objective. For example, a work placement involves trawling for candidates, testing and form-filling and preliminary sifts before the interview followed by induction and training after the interview. Those responsible are interested in an effective total process not just an effective interview and all the stages in the process interact. For these reasons it is difficult to generate principles of interviewing, there are always alternative viewpoints and exceptions. for example: 1. Always try to put the interviewees at ease. For senior posts it can be instructive to do the opposite to see how far the candidate can cope with the stress. 2. Always ask open-ended questions. If the interviewee is very nervous it can help to ask some questions which can readily be answered with a yes or no, this provides the opportunity to adjust the tension. 3. Do not make jokes. Sometimes the interviewee exhibits too much respect creating a communication barrier, a demonstration that the interviewer is only human by a weak joke can remove this barrier. 4. Always structure the interview to ensure that all essential points are covered. On the contrary a free-wheeling interview with direction changes as key points emerge can yield unexpected but valuable evidence. 5. Assess the interviewee under various headings to obtain a comparable profile score. Part of the skill of the interviewer is in extracting different salient points from individuals and appropriately weighting totally disparate facets. On the other hand it must be acknowledged that there are many bad interviews and, as always, improvement is possible by design, consideration of procedures and training. The design of the situation and the process should adhere to standard practices which have been found to be helpful by experience and commonsense. 1. Obtain all the relevant factual data (biography and testscores) before the final interview. 2. Provide a waiting room which has accessible toilet facilities including mirrors. 3. The interviewer should collect the interviewee, not have him sent for from the waiting room. 4. Provide the interviewee with a written job aid which indicates the name and function of the interviewer(s). 5. The relative positioning of the two main interactors and the direction of lighting are significant. The obvious \\u2018third-degree\\u2019 lighting should be avoided but not being able to see the  interview clearly is equally deleterious. Face to face is the most formal, side by side the least formal, seating at right angles is often a suitable compromise. 6. Provide the interviewee with opportunities to make points which have not been covered in questions and to ask other questions on matters important to him. This is not mere courtesy, what the interviewee regards as important can be very revealing. 7. Provide clear if indirect indications that the interview is ending. 8. Tell the interviewee what the next stage in the process will be and when. 9. Escort the interviewee at least to the door, again the behaviour at the parting point can be significant. In view of the above discussion training of interviewers and interviewees must necessarily be based on principles of training (p. 121) rather than principles of interviewing. Role playing and case studies are often used and they can be effective in reducing self-unease (self-awareness and self-analysis are necessary attributes of the good interviewer in action) and highlighting idiosyncratic features such as mannerisms and biases. The most powerful tool of the interview trainer is the closed circuit television system. So powerful that it needs to be used circumspectly to avoid reducing self-confidence. Normally the trainer will go through a reproduced interview and discuss the good and bad points which are usually clearly evident. This provides salutary knowledge of results of the interview itself if not of its degree of success in terms of a real objective. Randell (1978) suggests that an interviewing at work course can reasonably take two days covering \\u2018unfreezing\\u2019, conceptual analysis, technique development and  practice with feedback. Rutter (1979) devised an interview training programme for medical students involving a history taking scheme and two video-taped 15 minute diagnostic sessions one week apart, with discussion feedback based on a nine-point method of scoring information elicited. These scores were also used to validate the training by comparing experimental and control groups. Psychological testing The design and development of tests is a well established formal procedure involving checking for internal consistency and absence of ambiguity, efficiency of administration and marking procedures and the production of norms for definitive populations. There is a comprehensive list and description of available tests in the \\u2018Mental Measurement Yearbook \\u2019 which is updated at intervals of a few years. The reliability of a test is measured by correlation between the test scores, obtained at two different times, between different forms of the same test or between samples of questions in different parts of the same test. The interpretation of this measure of consistency is not as straightforward as it seems at first sight. For example, it has been pointed out that one person cannot be asked the same question twice, the second time he is not the same person because he has already been asked the question once. The validity of a test is an even more complex concept. It refers in general to the confidence the tester can attach to decisions based on the test scores. There are at least three kinds of validity: construct validity which refers to the degree to which the test seems to be based on psychological theory, content validity which describes how well the test measures what it is intended to measure and criterion validity which indicates its value as a predictor using as criteria other measures of relevant performance. The problems of criterion validity nicely illustrate the difficulty of finding any solid foundation on which to construct a psychometric measure. Suppose that the purpose of a particular test is to predict success in a particular job. Even with hindsight this is not easy to determine. The measure of success in a training course depends on the validity of the training course itself, supervisors' opinions based on experience of job performance are subject to distortion by various biases and measured performance such as productivity is subject to many vicissitudes independent of the ability of the producer. Faced with all these uncertainties the strategies adopted in the U.S.A. and Europe are in general different but usefully complementary. The American approach is to be as formal and rigorous as possible with insistence on systematic sampling, correlating and so on. The European approach is less tidy  and more humanistic with continuous questioning of philosophies and methodologies. A good example of the latter is Heim (1970) in which intelligence and personality testing is discussed in the context of the meaning of intelligence, creativity, personality, test taking as a skill and the different but inseparable limitations of speed and accuracy based measures. For further discussion of these elusive topics see Super and Bohn (1971), Drenth (1978) and Jessup and Jessup (1975). The aim of psychological measurement is optimal discrimination between individuals, for this purpose the difficulty of the test should match the range of abilities of the testees. For example an intelligence test may be too easy so that all testees have almost perfect scores, or too difficult in that all testees have very low scores, in both cases discrimination will be poor. One answer to this problem is tailored testing in which questions are computer-based and the test is adaptive in focussing the range of presented questions at about the level of success/failure which is appropriate for each testee. In this way discrimination is much improved without excessively lengthening the test time (Killcross and Cassie, 1975). The value and extent of the use of tests is subject to other changes in the history of the particular community. Obviously testing can be extensively utilised in war-time when many people are changing jobs both in military and civilian life. In peace-time the selection ratio, the ratio of applicants to available jobs is a key feature, there tends to be more testing in times of economic depression when jobs are scarce and also in post-war periods when there is extensive experience of using tests. The use of tests is not, of course, confined to selection procedures. Indeed there is currently much greater utilisation in guidance and therapy. Surveys In common with tests, surveys are required to be as reliable and valid as is feasible in the circumstances. Surveys are however different from tests in their objective: a test is usually carried out to find out about an individual, a survey is carried out to find out about an issue which is across people. The issue itself must be specified as precisely as possible usually in terms of both what we want to know and why we want to know. \\u2018Why\\u2019 will clarify \\u2018what\\u2019and will also contribute to the practical question of how much to spend on finding out. For reasons of economy the population of individuals approached is usually a small sample of the total relevant population. The size of the sample is less important than its structure. The first rule of sampling is that each member of the relevant population must have some chance of being included. If the  probability of being included is equal for each member of the relevant population then the sample is said to be a random one. Often the relevant population is stratified to ensure that the sample will be more representative in certain respects. for example a survey of hospital staff would not usually be carried out by selecting names at random from the total staff list, it might concentrate on doctors, nurses or cleaners only, or might sample medical, paramedical, administrative and support staff in proportions of their total numbers depending on the purpose of the survey. Sampling might also be carried out progressively involving different stages. For example a survey concerned with the whole National Health Service staff might begin by separating the hospital and the general practice services, then sample key regions of the country, separate urban, suburban and rural services and then select within organisations as mentioned above. Sampling might also involve time phasing as in attempting to detect opinion trends leading up to a general election. It is possible to estimate sample sizes required if the tolerable error is known and vice versa(Yates 1960). Data may be obtained purely by observation but usually involve asking questions. The design of questionnaires is itself an art with certain ground rules. Clearly the questions must be such that the relevant population can be expected to understand them and to make informed responses. The questions must avoid ambiguities which is not as easy as it might seem, it is desirable to obtain several opinions about the interpretation of each question from the same kind of people as those who will be in the survey. The sequence of questions may bias the answers e.g. a likely alternation of Yes/No answers is more \\u2018natural\\u2019 than a uniform series of Yes or No answers. The style of the question can also be unintentionally \\u2018loaded\\u2019 towards a particular response. There is a temptation to put in questions which will check against each other but this can irritate the responder who will easily detect redundancy. There is also the temptation to make the questionnaire too long in the hope of getting just that little bit more information, this can more than defeat its object by reducing the response rate. A new questionnaire should always be piloted, that is tried out on a small sample, before it is finalised. The main factor influencing response rate is whether the survey is postal or personal. The response rate to a verbal questionnaire can easily be 90% or more but a mailed questionnaire can have a response rate as low as 30% even with follow-up reminders. A low response rate is serious particularly if there is reason to suspect that persons likely to give particular kinds of answers might be less or more likely to respond than others. Telephone based surveys are currently popular as a reasonable compromise, this increases the speed of data collection rather than the insight which is revealed by personal interviews. Large scale impersonal surveys can be supplemented by more personally based interviews either with individuals or groups. The inference from samples may be deductive or inductive. Deductions can be made by statistical comparisons of samples to determine whether they are from different populations. Inferences from samples to populations can be made within quantitative confidence limits. Much of the labour which used to be involved in manipulating and presenting data can now be delegated to specialised computer software but the basic issues of coding and structuring data still depend on the skills of the analyst. The survey is the most extensively used method of obtaining generalisations about people. It can vary in precision from quantitative anthropometric surveys to attempts to describe the attributes of products which particular users prefer. The systematic survey is the antidote to excessive reliance on personal experience which is usually biased by exposure to idiosyncratic samples and by selective perception. The required systematic process is summarised in Table 2.3. Task training The distinction between task training and skill training is one of degree rather than kind. In task training the objective is to guide the trainee into following rules and essentially to make the performance more automatic. In skill training the opposite can apply, the trainee is persuaded to be flexible   and to orient himself towards the end rather than the means. The difference between the two kinds of training is not as great as would appear at first sight because it turns out that task training has in common with skill training an emphasis on the perceptual side of human functioning. Even in what appear to be straightforward motor skills the changes in learning are associated with greater selectivity and more economical use of the evidence needed to guide performance. These distinctions are summarised in Table 2.4. Task training is often called operator training or industrial training. The essential principles are: 1. The trainee must wish to learn, nothing can be achieved unless the trainee is adequately motivated. 2. The learning must be steered by adequate knowledge of performance. The behavioural characteristic which facilitates both of these requirements is knowledge of results. This is the most potent and consistent performance shaping factor ever uncovered by psychologists. It simultaneously promotes motivation and performance. Knowledge of how well one is doing will not provide the basic motivation in that the performer must care about his performance but if this is established, knowledge of performance is a most vigorous factor in developing and maintaining the will to perform. Carmichael and Dearborn (1950) demonstrated that continuous reading was likely to result in increased failure of concentration within an hour, but if the performance of the reader was checked and confirmed by asking questions at half-hour intervals then performance could continue for six to eight hours without signs of fatigue. Mackworth (1950), within his classical studies of vigilance, showed that without knowledge of results the proportion of detected signals decreased in succeeding half-hours compared with the first half-hour, but for subjects given knowledge of results there was no deterioration compared with the first half-hour through the full two hours of the study. Correspondingly the effectiveness of performance will improve with  knowledge of performance. This is as much a logical as a psychological principle. Clearly if a person has no knowledge of the success of performance the performance cannot improve because there can be no guidelines to steer the improvement. There have been many experiments demonstrating the validity of this principle and exploring detailed variables such as the timing and quality of feedback. For details see Welford (1968), Bilodeau (1969), Annett (1969). Miller et al . (1960) formalise it into what they call the TOTE principle (Test Operate \\u2014 Test \\u2014 Exit). The first test is a review of the situation, operate is the action which follows, the second test is a check as to whether or not the desired result has been achieved and this is followed either by another operation or by an exit if the desired result has been achieved. The TOTE is regarded as a fundamental unit of behaviour. Broadly speaking the more immediate the feedback the more effective it is except that there comes a point at which, to use Miller's (1953) distinction, learning feedback becomes action feedback, the latter improves the current response whereas the former improves succeeding responses. There is a risk that what is intended to be an aid only during training can become an undesirable crutch in that performance comes to depend on it but this is rare and can be avoided by using a suitable time delay, thus ensuring that it is really learning and not action feedback. The accuracy of the feedback need not be greater than the discrimination ability of the trainee but equally its value will diminish if it is too approximate. Feedback of the discrepancy between desirable and achieved performance is superior to feedback of absolute performance. Holding (1965) distinguished between successive sub-classifications of feedback into intrinsic/artificial, concurrent/terminal, immediate/delayed, non-verbal/verbal, separate/accumulated. The superior value of direct, rapid, unambiguous feedback dominates the choice of length and content of learning periods. There was an extended controversy between supporters of part and whole learning (Blum and Naylor 1968). The advantage of whole learning is that the connections between the parts are also learned simultaneously. However the advantage of part learning is that the feedback can be of much higher quality. An excellent compromise is the progressive-part method (Seymour, 1966) in which parts are learned separately but combined in groups within a tree-like structure which converges on the total task. See, for example, Singleton (1959), King (1964). The identification of the sub-tasks which are appropriate for intensive training with feedback is achieved by task analysis. Unfortunately there is confusion in the literature and the required procedures may be referred to as either skills analysis or task analysis (Seymour 1968, Singer and Ramsden 1969, Miller 1962). In the terminology used in this book task analysis is the correct description of this activity. It will be evident from the dates of most of these references that this kind of training and the supporting research flourished in the 1960s. The need for it has reduced but has not vanished over the past twenty years. Technology has shifted the general allocation of function slightly both in industry and in defence. Many processes have changed so that there is less direct human involvement in the production cycle, e.g. metal working, highly repetitive cycles can be conducted by robots and similar devices, e.g. in car assemblies, and the human operator gets better support even when still involved directly, e.g. the word processor as a substitute for the typewriter. Nevertheless within most jobs there are at least some tasks which are amenable to this kind of training and the benefits are considerable. If task training is neglected the larger job may be interfered with, e.g. the manager attempting to use a personal computer with inadequate key-board and data search performance. Key-board manipulation is a skill relevant to many tasks and is typical of psycho-motor skills in that the perceptual elements of identify and select dominate the motor element of actual key pressing. As mentioned earlier improvements in speed and accuracy result from changes in the control of performance. Skill training The simplest criterion for the distinction between a skill and a task is that a skill description is susceptible to individual differences but a task description is not. Skill implies idiosyncratic performance and as such can transfer between many tasks whereas a task meets a particular requirement within a system activity. Thus it follows that skill training is more generalised and generalisable and is better fitted to the overall role of human operators. Education is the ultimate form of skill training where no attempt is made to specify the particular purposes for which the skills might be utilised. This limits the potential rigour of design because the anchor of skill training is the specification of the objectives. Incidentally this accounts for the interminable debate about education, since objectives are not specifiable the content can only emerge as a consensus within the current zeitgeist . Skill descriptions are generalisable in that human operators have characteristic abilities and limitations and therefore have tendencies to perform in the same way. Differences in level of skill are partly but not wholly attributable to different locations on a learning curve which has some uniformity for that particular skill. Skills cannot be transferred directly from a trainer to a trainee, the function of the trainer is to provide conditions and guidelines which will facilitate learning. To do this the trainer must have a coherent model of the form of the   skill, this is attained by skills analysis. Inevitably skills analysis is more general and less definitive than task analysis although many of the same procedures for extracting evidence might be used. Skills analysis may also involve experiments to study more closely how the required objective is achieved (Drury and Fox, 1975, Singleton, 1978). It requires a broader approach than task analysis in that it often involves tracing the acquisition of the skill starting from the kind of persons who undertake training (the selection criteria) through the training procedures to the end product (the training success criteria). Such training often has an emphasis on features such as style and quality rather than mere speed of activity. This can extend beyond skill training to attitude training (see below). These differences are summarised in Table 2.5. There is emphasis on the end purpose or objective with relatively less attention to the means, partly so as to allow for individual differences and partly because the evidence accumulating in particular cases may change the direction of progress. For this reason skill training is sometimes called strategic training. Such activities are found in the broad range of tasks concerned with diagnosis. These can vary from dealing with faults in equipment (Tilley, 1967) to dealing with patients in a surgery or clinic (Rutter, 1979). In all cases although the reason for the activity is clear cut the means of achieving the desired end vary widely in terms of the path taken and the time required. The medical interview has much in common with counselling (Joanning et al ., 1979) and occupational guidance (Davis and Shackleton, 1975). Medical diagnosis involves social skills (Melhuish, 1979) but as discussed earlier the basis and development of these skills is not dissimilar from other  cognitive skills and correspondingly the training can follow the same principles (Singleton et al ., 1980; Argyle, 1981). Attitude training Attitudes are much more difficult to change than are skills and there can be ambiguity about what constitutes an improvement. Attitudes involve values which vary between individuals, societies and cultures. For example\\u2018brain washing\\u2019 is a form of attitude training which attempts to change the beliefs and values acquired within a particular culture (Biderman, 1967). The extreme techniques of isolation, starvation and other forms of stress induction give some indication of the pressures required to positively change attitudes. Generation of standard useful attitudes has always been one of the main purposes of military training. The objective is to cultivate the willingness to accept or ignore personal risk (Page, 1987). In the civilian context the purposes of attitude training are to do with care about quality and safety. Apprenticeship training is essentially about ensuring standards of workmanship and characteristically it appears at first sight to take an unconscionably long time. A common fallacy is the attempt to assess apprenticeship schemes in terms of task and skill training. Safety training is also about attitudes and such schemes rarely have the hoped for success because the difficulty and time required are invariably underestimated. This is also the reason why road accidents are so difficult to approach by training, safety on the road is much more to do with attitudes than with driving skill (Parry, 1968). In summary, we have no useful theory about the design of attitude training and success in practice is based on indirect traditional procedures. Skills analysis It will be appreciated from the earlier sections of this chapter that skills analysis is not reducible to simple procedures or recipes. In principle it is impossible because skills are by their nature totally integrated and interactive so that they cannot meaningfully be separated into independent parts. Nevertheless, as in many other situations the analyst, himself a skilled performer, has some success in practice. A skill description relates to how a task is performed and what is achieved rather than what actions are taken. The reference is to the end and the means is described in person terms rather than task terms. This is because the end is more consistent than the means. Although there may be considerable  idiosyncrasy in the actions the situation is not anarchical. The human operator  has characteristic ways of doing things and detection of these is one aspect of the skill of the skills analyst. There are differences in skills analysis procedure depending on the kind of skill. For the skills of interacting with the physical world the procedure summarised in Table 2.6 is appropriate. This involves observation of the skill in practice and during training and discussion with practitioners and trainers. There are useful ways of focusing such observation by contrasting good/poor performers and experienced/inexperienced performers. Discussion with practitioners can be focused by asking them to talk while performing and by jointly discussing performances observed on film or tape. For management skills there is greater emphasis on the objectives and how they are arrived at. Objectives in an organisational context are subject to many constraints. Some such as financial resources are easily specifiable, others such as not contravening the mores of the organisation are more elusive but a key aspect of these skills is sensitivity to limitations and obstacles as well as positive assets (Singleton, 1981). The variety of management tasks is often so great as to warrant a task analysis with separate skills analyses of particular tasks or groups of tasks. At this level the practitioner is often the conscious monitor of the practice and facility in self-monitoring is a useful indicator of skill. Social skills can involve not only self-monitoring but also monitoring of what another person is thinking as well as doing. For example, analysing a transaction between two skilled negotiators requires the study of the overt interaction and the identification of what each one is thinking about what he himself is doing and what his opponent is probably thinking about in the context of what he is saying (Singleton, 1983a). There are no standard formats for skill descriptions but usually they can be separated into two parts: the performance and the antecedents to the performance. That is respectively the key aspects of behaviour which contribute to success and the kind of education, training and experience normally required. At high levels of idiosyncratic skill (flair see p. 245) analysis is particularly difficult because the practitioner may have little conscious awareness of how or why he achieves unusual success. In fact it almost seems to be a condition of such performance that the exponent must not proceed logically but must temporarily inhibit his conscious critical faculties and accept control by intuition. This has been graphically described as \\u2018switching on the autopilot\\u2019(Drasdo, 1979). The commonsense view that to proceed with care is to proceed slowly can also be reversed in high level skills, there are instances where speed seems to be an essential accompaniment of delicate discrimination (Lacy, 1978). Thus, the observer cannot simplify his task by asking the practitioner to go more slowly nor can he rely on the introspection of the skilled performer. Skill is demonstrated by persistent and efficient pursuit of an objective and   the skill can usually be understood although not necessarily written down with any great precision in terms of a goal and the path towards that goal. The path is generated by navigating through a conceptual map containing landmarks and decision points (key features of the skill) and by the avoidance of obstacles and misleading features which have been sensitively detected. Applications Selection and guidance These processes are variations on the general theme of matching a worker to an appropriate job. In the case of selection the given point is the job and the population is searched to find the most appropriate worker, in the case of guidance one worker is the starting point and the range of jobs is searched to identify the best one. The two complementary processes are shown in Fig. 2. 1. They can usefully be considered together because they are similar and interactive. Thus, in the selection situation the process involves not only analysing and describing the job but also considering the availability of potentially appropriate workers. In the guidance situation the process involves analysing and describing the worker and consideration of the availability of suitable jobs. At the point of a successful match the worker is described in terms of the  kinds of job he could do and the job is described in terms of the kind of worker needed to do it, Table 2.7. For most people and jobs the whole process takes place within a localised community. For the highest level jobs a whole country or even an international community might be considered, but in European countries most workers attempt to find jobs which do not require either moving house or excessive travelling, and such proximity has corresponding advantages for the potential employers. Thus, the selection process involves   describing the job first by analysis (task and skills analysis) and then the translation of these data into worker relevant terminology. Consideration of the potential worker availability may lead to a redesign of the job either by the use of a different task combination or by introducing different technology. It is then necessary to communicate with the market by publicising the available job usually by advertising. This is itself an important stage in the process because a well prepared advertisement will enable the recipients to engage in self selection which does not, at this stage, involve further selector resources. To this end it is useful to have a multi-stage process as shown in Fig. 2.2. Having developed some interest on the basis of a necessarily brief advertisement a potential candidate can apply for further written details which should contain a comprehensive description of the job, the task and skill content, the responsibilities, the salary and the details of the organisation including its history and anticipated future, and an application form. A name with job title and telephone number should be included so that informal interaction and discussion of details of particular interest to the candidate can take place before the commitment to transmission of the application form. All this can be done at minimal cost. If the job description has been properly constructed there should not be an excessive number of applicants so that the next stage of a paper sift is also economical. There then follow the more expensive stages of final selection which may involve testing and interviewing as described earlier. The choice of the interviewers and the interview process depends on the particular job. At one extreme it may be one company representative, at the other extreme there may  be a series of interview boards. The interview board can have covert purposes where the senior person who is the chairman of the board will use the opportunity to orientate the precise expectations from the post to be filled including settling differences of opinion between his subordinates who are also members of the board. Ideally this should be done before candidates are interviewed but it can happen that differences in preferences for candidates reveal different opinions between board members which the chairman can detect and deal with. Guidance also involves testing and interviewing but this is invariably a two person situation of a counsellor and client. The problem is that most clients have only the vaguest, undefined ideas about the most suitable choice and direction of career. The counsellor can help by identifying the client's job-relevant characteristics and by contributing his knowledge about occupations (Fig. 2.3.). The former may be supported by testing although test results are essentially evidence to enable the individual to clarify his own self concept. The latter may start from national classifications of occupations such as the   American Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and the British Classification of Occupations and Dictionary of Occupational Titles (CODOT), but the counsellor's suggestions are likely to converge very rapidly into a more comprehensible repertoire of possibilities using evidence about the particular client (Singleton, 1975). This process can be supported by a computer with which the client may interact alone or it may be used by the counsellor as a database and prompter. A guidance episode necessarily takes place at one point in time within the developing skills and experience of the client. To emphasise the continuous nature of career development and the changing aspirations of people at different ages Super has proposed a division into five stages: Growth (0\\u201314 years); Exploration (15\\u201324 years); Establishment (25\\u201344); Maintenance (45\\u201364 years); and Decline (65 onwards)(Super and Bohn, 1971). Placement Placement is a mixture of selection and guidance, a process of mutual matching takes place within a known range of persons and jobs. The problem arises when a batch of recruits enter military service or when a large company takes on a new set of graduates. It is one application of psychometrics to man-power planning (see previous chapter). It becomes of particular significance within the currently fashionable company policy of separating core and peripheral employees. Given the vagaries of the market and rapid changes in processes and products stimulated by changing technology the strategy has evolved of taking on many employees for a short term only. These may be production workers but they may also be senior people; managers hired for a fixed term and technologists and others used as consultants. The placement task is to describe the requirements and the appropriate sources of individuals with the relevant skills (Fig. 2.1). For the core workers who are permanent staff again there may well be a mixture of people at all levels and here there is more emphasis on career progression and job satisfaction. Core employees are given written annual assessments which can be discussed with the immediate senior who is probably the writer of the assessment. For this purpose he is provided with a well-structured form by the personnel department who will also advise on the timely use of in-house or external courses to extend the range of skills of a particular employee. By contrast the peripheral employee is judged entirely on his past record or that of the consultant company which employs him on a semi-permanent basis. He is hired to undertake a specific task without reference to longer term features such as job satisfaction or career development. The peripheral employee will be compensated for his disadvantages by a much greater pay rate per hour and the company gains by reduced overheads and greater work-force flexibility. The whole strategy works very well for younger workers with well documented training and experience. This reinforces the view, developed in the previous chapter, that manufacturing industry in particular is following the Armed Forces in relying more and more on fit, skilled, mobile workers. Psychometrically the problem is to develop appropriate descriptive taxonomies so that a person's actual or potential contribution to an organisation is succinctly expressible. These remain primitive in that, on the whole, non-technical English is used with all the possibilities of ambiguity and communication at cross purposes which this implies. The accountants are ahead of the psychologists in developing ideas such as profit centres applicable to small groups or even to individuals. The increased awareness of the importance of the individual worker to profit and success generally, particularly at higher levels in the organisation, has stimulated the growth of a specialist placement profession colloquially known as the head hunters. These are companies which specialise in assisting a client in clarifying what kind of person they need and how to locate him within the potentially suitable worker population. They may also start with an individual and search for a location. This also is done mainly by interview although some use is made of psychometric tests, profiles and rating scales. The design of training schemes Designing and conducting training schemes is expensive and is not undertaken without good reasons. Among possible reasons are: 1. An inadequate reservoir of competent workers for particular tasks 2. A workforce sufficient in numbers or supply but not in skill level as evidenced usually by quality of work and less frequently by failures to meet production targets, danger to people and damage to equipment 3. Changes in technology which result in changes in required skills 4. An organisational commitment to continuous improvement of the skills of members 5. To meet statutory requirements in certain dangerous industries and services 6. As a service to customers buying equipment 7. As a service to the community paid for by public funds The remit of the training scheme and those responsible for it may end at the transition point to operational activity or may continue in those periods of work regarded as a continuation of training and supervised as such. In either case there needs to be close liaison between those responsible for training and those responsible for operations. On the other hand training is always vulnerable because the benefits are  long-term and it often needs protection from the demands of management and operations where there are other priorities. The simplest protective barrier is a geographical one, namely to conduct the training away from other centres of activity within the organisation. Sometimes a separate room is sufficient, in other situations a different part of the country may be chosen to provide adequate isolation. The essential vulnerability reinforces the requirement that the starting point of design should be a clarification of objectives followed by a consideration of the criteria of assessment that the objectives have been achieved. None of this need be numerical, sometimes numbers are used to provide a pseudo precision which can be counterproductive because the validity of the numbers can so easily be questioned. Precise verbal statements and descriptions avoid this pitfall. The sensitivity of training regimes to external pressures is demonstrated by the erratic interest and activity in this area observable at the national level. Inevitably there was a burst of activity during and immediately after World War II as shown for example by military research and development (Wolfie, 1951) and by the \\u2018Training within Industry\\u2019(TWI) movement (War Man-power Commission, 1945). Although research continued the next burst of application in the U.K. took place following the Industrial Training Act of 1964 (Robinson and Barnes, 1968, Barber 1968). The Act concentrated on training oriented by industry, the other possibilities considered were occupations and geographical regions. It resulted in the creation of a Central Training Council and a comprehensive range of Industrial Training Boards. Each Board was financed by a levy on the relevant industry. Not surprisingly this created a demand for experienced trainer manpower which could not be met, there was some disillusion and retrenchment in the 1970s. In the 1980s there has been another resurgence of activity following the realisation that the country is simultaneously suffering from a high rate of unemployment and a shortage of workers with specific skills. Extensive government resources are channelled by the Department of Employment through the Training Commission into the Youth Training Schemes, job training, skill training and so on. The objectives and criteria of success of any training scheme are best described in system terms. The next step is to translate these into a person oriented description of what the successful scheme graduate will have acquired. This is more than skills because the total expertise will include also rules, knowledge and contextual information. This last will vary from some acquaintance with the parent company to the basic technology behind the tasks. Together these make up the content or syllabus of the course. Decisions are then needed on how to train, which will include whether or which parts should be on-line or off-line, whether the operator is required to   function in a mainly programmed (i.e. rule-following) mode and how far he may need to function in a conceptual (i.e. actions based on understanding) mode. Consideration will be given to the use of training aids such as technical notes, schematic diagrams, video tapes, closed circuit television and simulators. The most important training aids are the instructors, the selection and training of these is a vital secondary scheme supporting the primary scheme. These many facets of training scheme design are shown in Table 2.8. Programmed instruction The origins of this movement are in the teaching machines first developed systematically about 1960. These consisted of film strips with associated projection devices and control panels which enabled the student to examine a particular screen presentation and respond by moving to another frame. The succeeding frame might take up another topic or might contain answers and comments on questions posed on the previous one. There was some scope for interaction in that the series of presentations was determined by  the student's choice of responses. If the student demonstrated by his choices that he did not fully understand a particular point then the programme could send him round an additional explanatory loop. This was called a branching programme as distinct from a linear programme which contained no loops. It will be appreciated that this technique of automated teaching seemed to have enormous potential. Classroom teaching is inherently skilled man-power intensive. There are obvious benefits in allowing each student to go at his own pace. It is not surprising that teaching machines had considerable appeal to the military and to large scale industry. Some years of intensive research and development resulted in a more realistic view (Glaser, 1965; Wallis et al ., 1966, Kay et al ., 1968). It became clear that the quality of the programme was the key to degree of success. The machine itself and its style of operation was incidental, in fact it was possible to achieve the same procedure if not quite the same discipline on the student by using programmed books with directional references to other pages at the end of each page. If a well-structured book is the answer then we have gone full-circle and back to the benefits of a systematic text-book. In research terms the study of programmed instruction was instrumental in encouraging a more systems view of the teaching/training process with associated trends towards greater consideration of objectives, task analysis, cost/ benefits and so on. Correspondingly from a practical training viewpoint there developed a more systematic approach to taxonomies of training and of instructional methods together with their inter-relationships. Tables 2.9 and 2.10 are examples from an overview of military training. Regarded in systems terms, programmed instruction cannot be an isolated continuously developing activity because it depends on the skills of the programme writer and these skills can only be developed on the basis of experience in the classroom. On the other hand teaching machines are one way of utilising the skilled teacher on a larger scale than his personal activity in the classroom. There is a different form of automatic teaching device called a pacing machine which can facilitate the development of motor skills. It consists of a machine which emits bleeps at timed intervals. The intervals are predetermined by the elements of a motor task or more simply by the target cycle time of a task. The trainee performs his task and tries to keep in phase with the bleeps which are intended to pace his performance. The required rate of work can be increased by shortening the time intervals. The second main phase of programmed instruction became feasible with the development of low cost computing. Computer aided instruction (C.A.I.) strictly should cover other techniques such as simulation and computer based procedures but it is usually intended to mean a situation where a student sits   in front of a screen on which the presented formats relate to his developing cognitive activity as expressed by his manipulations of the associated key-board. Even with this restricted interface there is enormous flexibility and the training tasks can vary from reading and simple arithmetic to diagnosing faults in the complex plant used in process industries. The use of computer aided instruction in primary schools has created a new  generation of what have been called \\u2018television children\\u2019. They regard the screen/keyboard interface as no more unnatural than a book is to earlier generations. This has far reaching consequences at the cultural level not only for learning but also for the design of jobs and even for leisure pursuits which increasingly depend on the same kind of interface. Many of the earlier forms of computer aided instructions used a central computer facility and a set of work-stations where a whole class of trainees could function simultaneously. The development of micro-computers resulted in the use of more isolated dedicated systems for just one trainee. In either case it is feasible to collect data about a trainee's performance and modify the presented information accordingly. It is also possible to collect learning data and feed it to an instructor either on-line or off-line. The widespread use of computer based learning and testing situations has stimulated the development of \\u2018student modelling\\u2019. All the data about one student is collected into one bank which changes dynamically with his learning achievements (and failures). In this way a student model containing a profile of attainment together with a history of progress to date can be made available to the trainer and to the trainee. However, communication links between the trainee and the trainer via a computer are not a substitute for the two-way conversation and observation which normally takes place in a class-room. Computer programmes are notoriously literal in their requirement for and response to operator responses. Trainee-computer communication failures for very simple reasons can lead to a complete hiatus unless they are detected and restored by an experienced trainer who can explain to the trainee why the system is failing to respond adequately. The third phase of programmed instruction called Tutorial Expert Systems (TES) involves artificial intelligence (see p. 234). To a trainee at the interface this may not seem very different from a teaching machine or computer aided instruction but the logic or architecture of the driving system is different so that even more flexibility is available. Instead of responding directly by logical rules and paths which have been envisaged and stored by the programmer an expert system training programme contains a knowledge base and an inference engine which can consult the knowledge base and respond more adaptively to the idiosyncratic needs of the trainee. It can also explain why it is proposing a certain strategy and why the detected strategy of the trainee is appropriate or not, and, if not, why not. From the user's point of view these systems are usually menu driven, that is the operator can select his path of consultation by choices within ranges of possible choices which are presented to him. Technically the task of the programme designer is made easier by the use of training skills and declarative programming languages. A training shell is a generalised  tutorial system which can operate with a variety of knowledge bases. A declarative programming language is one which can accept statements of relationships or rules for relationships contrasting with more traditional languages which encompass only step by step logic. It will be appreciated that this rapidly developing field of expertise contains extensive new jargon. At this stage the jargon is an obstacle in that anyone wishing to find out about the field has first to interpret the jargon. This is doubly difficult in that there is much overlap in terminology and concepts and specialists are not consistent with each other in the use of these new terms. No doubt the field will eventually clarify and mature and the terminology will be designed with precision so that meaningful concepts, tools and methods are unambiguously clarified and distinguished but this has not yet happened. From a behavioural standpoint the issues are the same as in any other field where technology is simultaneously providing many new facilities for supporting and measuring human performance. 1. Technology provides trainer aids not trainer substitutes. Thus computer assisted instruction (CAI) is more aptly descriptive than computer based training (CBT). 2. Technology enforces rigorous thinking to the point of revealing embarrassing gaps in learning, teaching and training theory. On the other hand technology also opens up new possibilities for monitoring and measurement which should support the development of better basic theory. 3. It is essential to develop the basic taxonomies behind the learning situation. for example any diagnostic task can be aided by a taxonomy of symptoms and a taxonomy of causes together with connections between them. 4. The need for interdisciplinary approaches is reinforced but the abiding difficulties of interdisciplinary communications remain at every level from different values and concepts to different terminologies. Communication between information technologists and behavioural specialists is a continuous struggle which can eventually be rewarding. 5. The design of the man-machine interface (MMI) or the human-computer interface (HCI) or more simply human interfaces (HI) remains one of the most difficult design problems but a crucial one in that poorly designed interfaces will wreck the performance of any system. 6. Evaluation is an essential procedure within the implementation of any new system. for training systems this can be very expensive because of the requirements to monitor the learning process and compare procedures which are anyway never completely comparable. Apparently extraneous variables such as trainee motivation and trainer expertise continue to dominate other factors such as differences in technology and differences in learning tasks. 7. Pedagogically the need to be much clearer about what is being taught and why is a mixed blessing. The formal discipline can sometimes tidy up muddled thinking but at other times it can interfere with the creatively developing interaction between trainer and trainee. In general, programmed instruction is most useful for tasks which can be comprehensively specified. This implies tasks based on rules for example arithmetic, or on logic, for example fault finding. The use of simulators When serious consequences can follow from human errors, e.g. in flying an aircraft, or when on-line operation is too expensive to be trusted to the hands of trainees, e.g. in process control, there is obviously a case for providing training devices which simulate the performance of on-line systems. In this way risks and costs are reduced, the performance of trainees is more easily measured and the presented situation is precisely controlled by the trainers. It is feasible to provide adequate exposure to events which in practice might be rare but very serious. High fidelity simulation is an interesting challenge to technological design. Simulators can provide demonstrations which always impress visitors. With all these advantages it is not surprising that a great deal of effort and resources go into the provision of simulators for high technology industry. Paradoxically the more advanced the technology the easier it is to provide good simulation. For example, a process control plant which consists of dials, charts and visual display units responding to activation of switches is much easier to simulate than, say, an opponent in a game of tennis. The perfect simulation which has been suggested but not yet implemented in process control, power generation and air traffic control would be to have two identical control rooms and two crews coming on duty. One crew would control a real system and the other would think they were so doing but would in fact be in a control room driven by software. This seems to be the only way of avoiding the main snag of simulation, namely that the trainee is aware that his performance is not important in that reality out there is not changing as a consequence of his actions. However, he will always know that his performance on a simulator is being assessed and, except for the business of risks, he may well take more care than he would in a real plant. In many if not most industries where simulators are used the benefits to training are not confined to dynamic system control and fault diagnosis. The control function is exercised by a team and the efficient interaction between the team members is also subject to improvement with practice (see p. 95). Transfer of training from a simulator to a real situation is never complete and does not necessarily increase with degree of fidelity. Simple simulations can be as effective for training purposes as more elaborate ones and can certainly be more cost effective. Degree of transfer is not easy to measure and needs to be carefully defined. For example, in training manually guided missile operators the degree of transfer is appropriately measured by \\u2018first shot\\u2019 success whereas in training and retraining flight deck crew the long term contribution to safety is the appropriate measure. Gagne (1962) provides an excellent review of earlier work in this field. More recent experience is reviewed in Stammers (1983). For details of experimental studies using large scale defence simulations see Parsons (1972). Moraal and Kraiss (1981) contains chapters dealing with simulations of a ship entering harbour, car driving, tank driving, the flight deck and air traffic control. MSC (1986) reviews the current use of simulators in twenty U.K. industries. As a research tool the simulator provides a happy medium between the precision of laboratory studies and the realism of field studies. It is not widely used for research outside the military because of the cost of high fidelity simulator time. A complex dedicated simulator can cost several million pounds and it needs its own crew of skilled operators. On the other hand standard micro-computers have considerable potentiality for quite elaborate simulation and effective simulation training on procedures may only require simple static mock-ups. Simulator development has been driven by technology rather than by the behavioural sciences with the standard result that there is a high reliance on face validity with relatively little resource devoted to systematic evaluation. Key features such as the timing and extent of simulator usage are based on experience in particular industries rather than on more formal evidence. The ergonomics approach to their use is shown in Fig. 2.4 but it must be admitted that this is as yet rarely followed in practice. Simulation should be regarded as one tool within the repertoire of the training specialist. There are other uses of simulators. They can be used for assessment independently of training. Data collected during simulator trials is a useful source of risk and reliability data. In the nuclear power plant design they are also used as the final stage of pre-construction design evaluation (Williams and Story, 1987).
