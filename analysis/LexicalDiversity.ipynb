This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

Susanna's one  doesn't really work at all, but  my one's just like  lukewarm. Oh well, let's have a look. Let's have a look at this  So  then, this we did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess  No. around and try and do any more. No, no. That's right. Cos we just got a real fright  when we couldn't stop the water pouring out. Oh. It's the little washer thing. Just turn the tap. Well I'll get cleaned. Come on, you take the stuff down and rather me just try and .   And then er, once I've done that I've gotta nip up the top and get a comb.

It's a sa kinda ratchet type thing. Oh. Just that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough. Just  thingie that Still, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out? No, not let the water out, you let the air out. When you bleed  Oh I see. it you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it. Oh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that Oh it's alright. but it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively. I mean, obviously it's off now but erm Is Angie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer. Hello? That's got a  a key down there. Oh. Oh.

Or put bits on your plate and then  just like put  this is a, I think this is a lime one. Mm! They taste a bit different actually to the ones we had. They don't like, used to have a little  . That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting.

Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm.

Well it's a  It came at the right time. E each of them  approved. Yeah. Am I still covered under BUPA? I think so. Erm, I, I wa , when I get into work on Monday I'll have to find out. I'm not ill or anything  so don't worry at the moment . Er, but I , I, I, I think  erm  I think had it out up until Robert is baby. He, he's joined his own wo , he's joined his own. He joined his own, but I mean when he was at college. Yeah. I think he said he was covered actually. Well I don't know.

It's a very good thing  That's right. if you've got  the money, sort of, the means to do it Well I think  then do. the bank pays and it  Yeah. comes out from  from  Ye  from my tax. Yeah. I do , I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health  in this kind, but to  know that you're covered rather  Yeah. than er Oh yeah. er ha , have problems  er er er, er when, when you  Definitely  require something. It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm.

It's the Ah perhaps to the toilet. There's loads er like, in the window  when we, like  newspaper articles and  things where it's been recommended and stuff. Ah I see. For, you know, they all, all put them up. Well d'ya know what I haven't to your place yet, the, fireplace. I haven't put the  up. Oh yeah. Well you can do that before you go. I just hate lying, when you suddenly hear these things come down on, just have visions of like a  a  po pouring out. Yeah I, I, I think what it is, it probably needs a clean. Definitely. And er  I was gonna, er er, look up the thing. Don't, it doesn't work apparently. Cos Jim who was in there last year said it didn't work when he was there. Oh oh. So I don't, I don't know if it's  attached or  anything, I don't know. I'm not sure. I haven't been gassed yet anyway,so   I don't think any gas or anything's coming out. No. And you'll find your stuff's  staying there? No I kept a couple    of newspapers but er Well I've, I, I bought a stack with me in fact  It's . so, so, if I I know, I wondered why you brought the Gazette, I thought  strange!

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

Is er, I don't know  if there's something wrong, but it doesn't  the heat isn't  well Angie's one's like boiling hot Yeah. Susanna's one  doesn't really work at all, but  my one's just like  lukewarm. Oh well, let's have a look. Let's have a look at this  So  then, this we did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess  No. around and try and do any more. No, no. That's right. Cos we just got a real fright  when we couldn't stop the water pouring out. Oh. It's the little washer thing. Just turn the tap. Well I'll get cleaned. Come on, you take the stuff down and rather me just try and .   And then er, once I've done that I've gotta nip up the top and get a comb.

Erm  what we can do is er  use something here. I bought this lot down with me. It might be in the other room actually. Now so  the thing, and that goes in here, can use Oh! What, is it a spanner? It's a sa kinda ratchet type thing. Oh. Just that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough. Just  thingie that Still, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out? No, not let the water out, you let the air out. When you bleed  Oh I see. it you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it. Oh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that Oh it's alright. but it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively. I mean, obviously it's off now but erm Is Angie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer. Hello? That's got a  a key down there. Oh. Oh.

Or put bits on your plate and then  just like put  this is a, I think this is a lime one. Mm! They taste a bit different actually to the ones we had. They don't like, used to have a little  . That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting. Give your apologies as you walk in   Well yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if  You know these, these , V P's V P's, yeah. sits down and says . So this time I was determined not to erm, get caught. And it's paid off. It was a, a nice place. Nice and sunny. Ba , I had  Yeah. lunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till  till quarter to two  erm  and then went back inside.

Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm.

Well it's a  It came at the right time. E each of them  approved. Yeah. Am I still covered under BUPA? I think so. Erm, I, I wa , when I get into work on Monday I'll have to find out. I'm not ill or anything  so don't worry at the moment . Er, but I , I, I, I think  erm  I think had it out up until Robert is baby. He, he's joined his own wo , he's joined his own. He joined his own, but I mean when he was at college. Yeah. I think he said he was covered actually. Well I don't know.

It's a very good thing  That's right. if you've got  the money, sort of, the means to do it Well I think  then do. the bank pays and it  Yeah. comes out from  from  Ye  from my tax. Yeah. I do , I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health  in this kind, but to  know that you're covered rather  Yeah. than er Oh yeah. er ha , have problems  er er er, er when, when you  Definitely  require something. It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm.

It's the Ah perhaps to the toilet. There's loads er like, in the window  when we, like  newspaper articles and  things where it's been recommended and stuff. Ah I see. For, you know, they all, all put them up. Well d'ya know what I haven't to your place yet, the, fireplace. I haven't put the  up. Oh yeah. Well you can do that before you go. I just hate lying, when you suddenly hear these things come down on, just have visions of like a  a  po pouring out. Yeah I, I, I think what it is, it probably needs a clean. Definitely. And er  I was gonna, er er, look up the thing. Don't, it doesn't work apparently. Cos Jim who was in there last year said it didn't work when he was there. Oh oh. So I don't, I don't know if it's  attached or  anything, I don't know. I'm not sure. I haven't been gassed yet anyway,so   I don't think any gas or anything's coming out. No. And you'll find your stuff's  staying there? No I kept a couple    of newspapers but er Well I've, I, I bought a stack with me in fact  It's . so, so, if I I know, I wondered why you brought the Gazette, I thought  strange!

I can't believe that we're not going. So gutted! I mean, he doesn't like them! No. He never liked the band. And he's going to see it. And I can't even get one ticket. Go and buy myself one . I'm gutted! I really am. You'd think he would either  apply for another one or, or let you have his. I've told him , if anybody's ill and his offers on there  I'll be there. It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah. And I didn't know they'd done any extra days. But they added them and nobody told me. Oh. I'm not happy! Are they that good? Definitely. Only band I want to see playing  in the world.

I take it we're leaving pretty quickly? No I, I had a feeling that I was gonna get landed with the bill there. Dear oh dear! It's the reason you came to see me. I thought it was a matter of going Dutch. I dunno. That's only on dates, you're my father. Is , oh oh. You  That doesn't count. Well let's see if I've got any money. My God! I think I paid it in. Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy.

Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God!

They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lexical_diversity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 34.88208708655171,\n        \"min\": 40.086543689452384,\n        \"max\": 190.0562514499756,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 182,\n        \"samples\": [\n          91.1888818898198,\n          61.067154159727494,\n          136.2745079210625\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Some observers are predicting the imminent collapse of the military regime which has ruled Ethiopia for 15 years. The rebels, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), are threatening to cut off Dese, a key garrison town protecting part of the road linking Addis Ababa with the port of Assab. They have advanced down the Asmara road in the past four weeks and are now reported to be operating south of Dese. They have surrounded a garrison at Bati, to the east, and on 19 September they attacked Mile on the Assab road, closing it for 36 hours. Helicopter gunships ply constant missions from their base at Kombolcha: yesterday I watched MiG-21 fighter-bombers, loaded with bombs and rockets, take off from Dire Dawa and head west. The estimated 40,000 troops in Dese are being joined by the remnants of the defeated Third Army, which is struggling down the road or surrendering to the rebels. One estimate puts government losses in the past four weeks at 20,000 killed, captured or deserted. The government in Addis Ababa will say nothing about the situation, and the war is not reported by the state-run media. However, recent visitors to Dese describe the areas as chaotic, with whole units leaderless and unwilling to fight. Soviet advisers have been withdrawn from Dese and Kombolcha. A Soviet Deputy Defence Minister, General Varrenikov, has been in Addis Ababa for the past week. He is reported to be negotiating the complete withdrawal of the 1,500 Soviet military advisers. The Russians have said they believe in a negotiated settlement to the civil war, but they are continuing to supply arms to President Mengistu, apparently to allow him to negotiate from a position of strength. A large consignment of weapons was unloaded from a Soviet ship at Assab on 21 September. Weapons will not, however, save President Mengistu if no one is willing to use them. The Ethiopian army, the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa, consists largely of press-ganged young peasants or unemployed urban teenagers who have been drafted to the front after a few weeks' training. At the end of a spectacularly successful year, the TPLF drove the Ethiopian army out of Tigray province in February. Few people thought the Tigrayans could continue their success outside their own province, but on 26 August the TPLF began an advance which drove the government forces out of Korem and Kobo. Three weeks ago, the 102nd Airborne Division, Russian-trained and regarded as a crack unit, was rushed from its base at Asmara to the front line, but it too has been mauled by the rebels, who swept through the mountains flanking the main road, capturing all the towns as far as Woldiya. Meanwhile, in Eritrea, to the north, a de facto ceasefire is holding between the government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which is seeking independence for Eritrea. Peace talks began in Atlanta, Georgia, last month and are due to resume in Nairobi on 18 November. The only government-controlled areas in highland Eritrea are the road between Asmara and Massawa and the garrisons of Keren, Senafe and Adi Kwala. Government troops are digging deep defences at Asmara and there is no doubt that, should the peace talks fail, the EPLF will resume fighting and attack it, or try to cut it off. One option for the TPLF is to strike east, to the Assab-Addis Ababa road. If they succeed in cutting it, they will have achieved checkmate. They could strike west and try to cut off Gonder, another heavily-fortified garrison, or they could try to continue rolling south towards the capital. Addis Ababa is guarded by about 20,000 troops, including President Mengistu's Praetorian guard, which saved him during the coup attempt in May. No one believes the TPLF can take the capital, but their continuing success could persuade senior army officers that President Mengistu should be replaced by someone who can stop the war and negotiate. \\u2018The situation is very, very fluid and there is a possibility that the regime will disintegrate,\\u2019 said one Western diplomat. The TPLF has recently transformed itself into the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Movement to give itself more national credibility, but its core remains the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray, whose political model seems closest to the late Enver Hoxha's Albania. Much as many Ethiopians fear and loathe the government, they are calling for more political and economic freedom, and would not feel liberated by the TPLF. Nor would they welcome a takeover by the Tigrayans. Most of the people between Dese and the capital are Maharan and Oromo. Nevertheless, there have been several incidents in the capital recently. Bombs were placed in the fuel depot at the airport last month, and a small power station nearby was blown up. Tribalism and liberation meet at Transkei burial From JOHN CARLIN in Bumbane, Transkei WHEN is an independent state not an independent state? When it's a homeland. Bumbane, otherwise known as \\u2018the Great Place\\u2019, is the royal burial site of the Tembu tribe here in what South Africa insists on calling the Republic of Transkei, a so-called \\u2018homeland\\u2019 for black people upon which Pretoria imposed political independence in 1976. This helps explain the extraordinary spectacle here yesterday of 5,000 loudly \\u2018anti-colonial\\u2019 black people clamouring against independence and for political re-integration with South Africa. The occasion was that black South African speciality, the political funeral. Behind it all was the hand of Nelson Mandela, which may lend the event much significance should it turn out that President FW de Klerk is serious about negotiating with black leaders. Mr Mandela belongs to the royal family of the Tembu tribe. The man buried yesterday was the king of the Tembus, the most powerful of the half dozen tribes who speak the Xhosa language. Since there are six million Xhosas -one million more than the entire white population of South Africa \\u2014 they are potentially a serious force for Mr de Klerk to reckon with. They count among their number more than 70 per cent of the leaders in the executive of the African National Congress. The ANC does not like this fact to be mentioned, because it purports to eschew tribalism in favour of an all-embracing black nationalism. All the more odd, then, that yesterday's funeral should have been both a celebration of time-honoured Tembu ritual and the most vocal demonstration in years on what the rest of the world calls South African soil of the strength of the ANC and its far from tribalistic affiliate, the South African Communist Party. The imprisoned Mr Mandela has met in recent months more than a dozen of the chieftains and assorted dignitaries \\u2014 his Xhosa wife, Winnie, among them -who were on the podium. Yesterday not only were the Xhosas out in force, it seemed that a convention of the entire Mass Democratic Movement -essentially the exiled ANC's internal representatives \\u2014 had been called. King Sabata Dalindyebo would have been pleased. He died three years ago. But his body was exhumed last Monday for the ceremonial reburial yesterday. The problem had been that there was no ceremony the first time around. He was buried, under orders from the corrupt and usurping Matanzima brothers who used to run Transkei, in a commoner's grave. The Matanzimas were forced out after a military coup nearly two years ago. The benign ruler who took over, Major-General Bantu Holomisa, spoke at the graveside. In so doing he also gave his blessing to \\u2014 what in effect proved to be the case \\u2014 declaring the Transkei, or at least Bumbane, the first ANC liberated zone, however fleetingly, yesterday afternoon. Draped over the king's coffin was an ANC flag. He had vehemently opposed Transkei's bogus independence and, hounded by the Matanzimas, had fled to Zambia, where he joined the ANC. Much plotting went into the organisation of the event. Major-General Holomisa met the president of the ANC in London recently. His brother, who lives in the same house, spoke with Mr Mandela for five hours on 4 August. Mrs Mandela has been shuttling back and forth with messages from her husband's prison home near Cape Town. The tribal leaders who visited Mr Mandela have also met the top ANC leaders in Zambia. The upshot of it all is that Major-General Holomisa has made Transkei a haven of sorts, a thorn in Pretoria's side, for the ANC. He will no doubt tread very carefully, but the consequences of his stand could be far-reaching. He said yesterday that he meant to conduct a referendum to test whether Transkei's three million people wished to retain \\u2018independence\\u2019 or not. If the answer is \\u2018no\\u2019, South Africa may have to confront the beginning of the end of the \\u2018homelands\\u2019 system. Swapo remains favourite to win the United Nations-supervised elections next month From JOHN CARLIN in Bumbane, Transkei A woman shows her support for the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) at an election rally in Windhoek. Swapo remains the overwhelming favourite to win the United Nations-supervised elections next month, but claims that the organisation has detained and tortured many of its members in Angola and Zambia may deprive it of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government in an independent Namibia without holding another election. The UN is investigating the allegations. Swapo and its main rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, have accused each other of violent intimidation during the campaign. Out of India: The snow-wreaths melt away in the heat of battle By TONY ALLEN-MILLS BHARATPUR \\u2014 The monsoon rains are lifting across the Gangetic floodplains, and there is a hint of magic in the air. The winter migrations are beginning, and the skies over northern India are alive with transiting birds. In the next few weeks, as the seasons change in eastern Europe and central Asia, spectacular colonies of painted storks will descend on the lakes and marshes of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. They will be followed by flocks of pintail ducks and greylag geese. Tens of thousands of birds, navigating with miraculous precision, arrive each year at their Indian winter homes. But for one tiny group of exquisitely beautiful long-distance travellers, the coming journey may prove their last. Somewhere along the Ob river in central Siberia, slowly building strength for a 3,500-mile flight, wait perhaps 50 Siberian cranes. They are, as far as naturalists are aware, the only surviving members of a rapidly dwindling population of a bird the Siberians call the \\u2018snow-wreath\\u2019. Every autumn, the birds rise from the Ob river swamps to begin a perilous journey south. One small group heads for Iran; the rest fly through the Soviet Union, across the battlefields of Afghanistan and past the guns of Pakistani poachers to the monsoon-soaked plains of India, where they pass a lazy winter feeding on plants. But each year fewer arrive. A century ago, more than 200 Siberian cranes were recorded in the jheels and marshes of Uttar Pradesh. In 1984, there were 41; two years ago, 31. Last year 23 arrived. Only 13 reached Iran. The Siberian crane stands four and a half feet tall, its brilliant white plumage offset by a blood-red beak, face and legs. Jet-black wing quills are visible in flight. Like most birdwatchers, I have only seen them in pictures -invariably in supremely elegant poses, their long, thin beaks delicately probing the water for weeds. Unlike most birdwatchers, I am lucky enough to live less than four hours' drive from their regular winter home \\u2014 a wildfowl marsh constructed by one of the Maharajahs of Bharatpur. I was there recently, talking to Dr Lalitha Vijayam about her research on the Siberian crane's problems and about my chances of seeing one before the Ob river race becomes extinct. The Maharajahs of Bharatpur were dedicated hunters, famous for their prodigious shoots. A plaque in the Bharatpur marshes records the November day in 1938 that the then Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, bagged 4,373 wildfowl, 3,044 of them before lunch. The royal guns did not fall silent at Bharatpur until 1964. Soon after, thanks largely to the endeavours of India's finest ornithologist, Salim Ali, the ex-Maharajah's swamp was turned into a sanctuary unequalled in Asia. It is now formally known as the Keoladeo Ghana National Park, and its own guide book charmingly and accurately boasts: \\u2018Birds! Birds!! Everywhere Birds!!!\\u2019 Of all the species visible in Bharatpur, none is more romantic or mysterious than the Siberian crane. There are many suitably marshy habitats in the Ganges basin, yet the bird has invariably stopped at Bharatpur. There are other beautiful cranes in the park \\u2014 my favourite is the demoiselle, a slender grey bird with delightful black plumes and ear-tufts. But no other bird exerts quite the appeal of the annual visitor from the river Ob. Every year the Indian newspapers chart Siberian crane sightings with the devotion and enthusiasm the British press usually only musters at times of royal births. Dr Vijayan, a research scientist with the Bombay Natural History Society, is leading a study of the Siberian crane that began in 1980. She confesses her team can only guess at the causes of the bird's decline. \\u2018We think they are being shot for meat when they land in Afghanistan,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018And we know that some have been poached in Pakistan.\\u2019 The cranes may also have suffered from Bharatpur's environmental problems. Scientists are trying to calculate the long-term impact of the catastrophic drought of 1987. There have been rows over cattle-grazing and other encroachment. Fortunately, this year's monsoon was short but sharp, and improved water management has produced good floods. Dr Vijayan also reports that after a long struggle to arouse their interest, Pakistani environmentalists are aware of the threat to the bird. But the war rages on in Afghanistan, and crane protection is understandably a low priority in Kabul. The war, and the region's complex geopolitical concerns, are also preventing naturalists from undertaking the most effective means of monitoring the Siberian crane -ringing the flock with miniature transmitters that could be tracked from space. The prospect of Moscow, Kabul, Islamabad and New Delhi all agreeing on a joint satellite monitoring venture is not great. The scientists can only wait and hope. Which is what I shall be doing for the next three months. Given the awesome sum of human misery in this part of the world, I suppose I shouldn't get too worked up about the fate of a flock of birds \\u2014 particularly as the much larger eastern race of the Siberian crane, which migrates from north-eastern Yakutia to the lower reaches of the Yangtse river in China, is apparently surviving well. But if the snow-wreaths of the Ob river don't reach Bharatpur this year, I shall feel inescapably sad. Russians send Kabul 2,000 supply trucks From AHMED RASHID in Kabul THE SOVIET UNION is supplying the Afghan government with another 2,000 trucks to step up the supply of food, fuel and ammunition to Kabul's 1.5 million people before the winter snows affect the roads. The unconditional Soviet support to the Kabul regime is on such a scale that the US and Pakistan cannot hope to match it. Every few minutes a truck thunders down the strategic Salang Highway on its way from Hiratan on the Soviet border to Kabul. Convoys half a mile long are watched over by scattered Afghan army outposts on the hills by the road. Drivers report no guerrilla attacks, even though security north of the Salang Tunnel has been largely handed over to local militia units and the army withdrawn. After setting up a bitumen plant and providing earth-moving machinery, the Soviets helped cut a new road east of the old Salang Tunnel. The highway, which links up with the old road south of Charikar, avoids mujahedin territory and and passes through a region where the Kabul regime has concluded deals with local guerrilla commanders. \\u2018We are receiving 300 trucks of supplies a day from the Soviet Union,\\u2019 said the deputy prime minister, General Mohammed Hakim. A US-trained officer, 48-year-old General Hakim is the most experienced convoy trouble-shooter in the regime, having organised the relief convoy to the besieged city of Khost two years ago and saved Kabul from near starvation last year. \\u2018The government's main preoccupation is getting supplies to the cities before winter,\\u2019 he said. This year, government-held countryside produced only 150,000 tonnes of wheat, or 10 per cent of Afghanistan's total consumption, due to a bad harvest and the war. Of the 90,000 tonnes of wheat needed in Kabul to survive the winter, 37,000 tonnes have already been stockpiled, General Hakim said. Afghan and diplomatic sources said that the Soviets would provide 2,000 more trucks and fuel tankers, but General Hakim admitted that the real problem will be fuel, which is already in short supply in Kabul. Diesel prices on the black markeat are ten times higher than the official price. Even for some government cars, diesel is only available on the black market. For the past few weeks President Najibullah has been meeting militia commanders from around the country offering them more weapons and money to maintain their loyalty and keep the roads open. Since all private truck owners are now allowed to bring food from Hiratan and sell it in Kabul, some militia commanders, most of them former mujahedin, are buying trucks and becoming traders. The Soviet relief effort is also employing aircraft. Up to 40 flights a day bring in weapons and ammunition, including Frog 7s, a short range surface-to-surface missile that is less expensive than the Scud missiles already provided. The flights that circle Kabul every quarter of an hour are a morale booster for the hard-pressed population. \\u2018The Soviet Union is giving us oxygen \\u2014 bread and weapons to defend ourselves,\\u2019 said Suleman Laeq, the minister for tribes and nationalities. Soviet aid to Kabul is estimated at between $250m (\\u00a3154) and $300m a month. The US and Saudi Arabia will have funnelled some $700m to the Pakistan-based mujahedin by the end of this year. Soviet aid has helped in maintaining the population's morale and the regime's credibility and unity, while US aid to the to the mujahedin has done little to increase their unity, morale or fighting ability. WASHINGTON \\u2014 The US should explore the possibility of an agreement with the Soviet Union to cut off military supplies to Afghanistan, a leading senator said in a report published yesterday, Reuter reports. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also called for a neutral government in Kabul to hold elections or seek a traditional Afghan consultative assembly. Mr Pell issued the report after a trip to Pakistan in August and talks with Pakistani leaders and leaders of the US-Pakistan-backed provisional government. Army on guard as China fetes its Revolution From ANDREW HIGGINS in Peking CHINA'S leaders celebrated the 40th anniversary of Communist rule yesterday, protected from their people by the biggest security operation undertaken in the capital since the People's Liberation Army stormed into Peking four months ago. Standing exactly where Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping joined other party leaders atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace to preside over a night of fireworks and martial music in Tiananmen Square. Fearful of protests or violence by citizens outraged by the army's brutal assault on Tiananmen on 4 June, armed troops cordoned off a large area of central Peking, admitting only hand-picked spectators into the square. Among the guests were thousands of plain-clothes police and out-of-uniform soldiers, some of whom arrived in military trucks, dressed as clowns. Authorities have themselves acknowledged fears that \\u2018counter-revolutionaries\\u2019, still at large despite a nationwide crackdown on dissent, might try to sabotage the anniversary. Throughout the day, thousands of troops patrolled central Peking, while police set up road-blocks to check cars in the city's north-west university district of Haidian, the birthplace of China's seven-week-long pro-democracy movement. Many students, still bitterly hostile to the government despite a barrage of propaganda and weeks of political study classes, refused to take part in the celebrations, spending the day inside their dormitories. On instructions from authorities, Peking University, the focus of the student rebellion, sent a dance troupe, one of scores of similar groups dragooned into the celebrations. Although sullen opposition and private anger still shadows the Communist Party, no disturbances were reported during yesterday's events. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets to watch the firework display -a fact which, Mr Deng boasted, proves that \\u2018China's social order has returned to normal\\u2019. He made the comment in remarks to a visiting official from North Korea, one of only a handful of foreign countries to send special delegations for national day. Others included East Germany, Cuba and the Soviet Union \\u2014 a list that reflects China's sudden dependence on the Communist bloc for its friends. Most Western ambassadors boycotted the firework display but did attend a reception on Saturday hosted by the Prime Minister, Li Peng. Many Western businessmen attended both. Strident editorials in the official press condemned foreign interference and predicted the worldwide triumph of socialism. The Peking Daily accused the West of trying to subjugate China for 40 years and of now waging \\u2018psychological warfare and dreaming of victory without war\\u2019. The unusually confrontational rhetoric suggests that Mao was perhaps less than correct when, 40 years ago yesterday, he announced to Tiananmen: \\u2018The Chinese people have stood up\\u2026we have friends all over the world.\\u2019 HONG KONG \\u2014 More than 3,000 people marked the 40th anniversary of Communist rule in China yesterday by rallying to protest against the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Peking, AP reports. Szeto Wah, a Hong Kong legislator, told the crowd: \\u2018A republic ruled by the people has not yet been realised.\\u2019 The three-hour rally was organised by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement of China. Cambodia puts in more troops From ANDREW HIGGINS in Peking ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (UPI, AP)\\u2014 Heavy fighting continued in western Cambodia yesterday as the Vietnamese-backed government brought in reinforcements to face a drive by non-communist resistance forces, resistance officials and military sources said. \\u2018We might have to stop our advances if there are a lot of reinforcements,\\u2019 said a senior official of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), Ieng Mouli. Military reports showed the KPNLF offensive launched on Saturday had made quick initial progress, he said, and troops had captured at least 10 government positions and large quantities of weapons. The acting commander-in-chief of the KPNLF, Dien Del, said the fighting had continued overnight and had been \\u2018more than 70 per cent successful\\u2019. He expected his troops would take two more towns and said his fighters now controlled the whole of Highway 69, along the Thai frontier, north of Sisophon. Western sources at the Thai-Cambodian border confirmed the KPNLF had scored some major gains, and military sources there said the fighting was continuing. The low rumble of artillery fire could be heard from this nearby Thai border town. One source attributed the quick victories of the initial push to agreement by the ill-trained Heng Samrin forces to accept payments to abandon their positions before the assaults. Military sources said the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge guerrilla group had joined the KPNLF in a pincer attack on Sisophon. Earlier, Abdul Gaffar Peang-meth, the assistant to the KPNLF commander-in-chief, Ak Sutsakorn, had denied any knowledge of co-ordination with the Khmer Rouge. Prisoner of Conscience: Burmese prisoners face death: Moe Kyaw Thu, Zwa Gyi and Nyi Nyi U By CAROLINE MOOREHEAD A BOY of 17 and two men in their twenties face execution in Burma for planting a bomb, but others involved in the crime say they took no part in it. Human rights organisations maintain that the men have been wrongly convicted and are being victimised for being members of the leading opposition political party. were arrested on 17 July in connection with a parcel bomb which exploded in the Syriam state oil refinery 10 days earlier and killed two people. Violent incidents of this kind have become commonplace in a country where all human rights are being eroded. Nothing was known of the fate of the three men, all of them active on behalf of the National League for Democracy, until 27 July, when the official radio announced that they had been condemned to death. Their trial had been completed in a single morning session before a military tribunal inside Insein Prison, an overcrowded place notorious for torture. The trial was conducted under martial-law provisions proclaimed only on the day of their arrest, and was the first to be held under these procedures. Lawyers said the prosecution was allowed to present evidence, but that there was no mention of any defence evidence. Martial law orders empower military tribunals to \\u2018waive unnecessary witnesses\\u2019 and to impose death sentences \\u2018regardless of the provisions under existing laws\\u2019. It emerged that not only was there no reliable evidence of guilt, but, on the contrary, there was considerable proof of innocence. The Karen National Union, which admits to violent opposition to the military government, denies the three men were in any way involved. A fourth man, said to have provided the bomb, has added that they had nothing to do with it. No appeal is allowed under Burma's new martial law orders and Amnesty International fears that Moe Kyaw Thu, Zaw Gyi and Nyi Nyi U may be executed any day. Aquino prepares for clash over Marcos body From KEVIN HAMLIN in Manila PRESIDENT Corazon Aquino of the Philippines is bracing herself for a legal battle over her decision not to allow the remains of the former president, Ferdinand Marcos, to be returned home from Hawaii for burial. At the behest of Marcos' family, Vice-president Salvador Laurel, Mrs Aquino's estranged deputy and now head of an opposition party, and a group of \\u2018loyalists\\u2019 will today attempt to reverse an earlier Supreme Court ruling to uphold Mrs Aquino's decision to prohibit Marcos' return. But at the weekend, although Mrs Aquino said she would respect any Supreme Court decision, she said she had received \\u2018highly sensitive\\u2019 information that strengthened her resolve. She said yesterday that Marcos's remains may be brought to the Philippines when emotions have subsided. Mrs Aquino cited the case of Napoleon, who died in exile in 1821 and remains made \\u2018a very triumphant return\\u2019 to France in 1840 when \\u2018things had settled down\\u2019. Marcos ruled the Philippines for 20 years before Mrs Aquino was swept to office on a wave of \\u2018people power\\u2019 in 1986. The Aquino government accuses him of having stolen up to US$10bn (\\u00a36.1bn) from the country during his reign. He died in Honolulu on Thursday. Calling Mrs Aquino's decision an infringement of universal human rights, Mr Laurel said: \\u2018The ban is contrary to the constitution and is therefore illegal.\\u2019 But citing \\u2018national welfare\\u2019, the Supreme Court earlier voted eight to seven to uphold the ban imposed by Mrs Aquino. Mr Laurel said: \\u2018Now that he is dead, that makes a lot of difference.\\u2019 Details of the \\u2018highly sensitive\\u2019 information have not been made public, but it is understood to have originated from intelligence and diplomatic sources and probably relates to plans by Marcos loyalists to capitalise on his return to the country. At meeting on Saturday Mrs Aquino gave aides details of this information. The military is on alert, with half of its troops confined to barracks as a precaution against disturbances. There has, however, so far been little popular reaction in the country to the death of Marcos. Several hundred people have been attending a nightly candle-lit vigil, and there has been one other small protest. Mubarak peace proposal exposes Israeli tensions From CHARLES RICHARDS in Jerusalem THE ISRAELI cabinet is being called this week to debate for the first time proposals made by Egypt for advancing the search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The cabinet session \\u2014 billed, like many before, as \\u2018crucial\\u2019\\u2014 is to discuss the 10 points submitted by President Mubarak to clarify Israel's initiative for elections in the occupied territories. They have directed a powerful light on the ambiguities of the initiative. This has not only exposed the underlying differences between Likud and Labour which the initiative papered over. They have also highlighted old rifts and stimulated new ones within the parties themselves. Mr Mubarak's proposals were first formally presented to Israel on 16 September. The Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzak Shamir, procrastinated and postponed discussion of the points at the cabinet, the inner cabinet, or the top decision-making body known as the \\u2018forum of four\\u2019 senior ministers, in the hope that the problem would go away. In the meantime, ministers conducted individual diplomatic initiatives on the basis of Egyptian ideas not yet discussed by the government. The Defence Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, met Mr Mubarak in Cairo, and in the US, Mr Arens and Mr Peres separately met President Mubarak and the US Secretary of State, James Baker. The two issues at the heart of the disagreement are those which have killed at birth any attempt in the past dozen years to address the Palestinian question: Who speaks for the Palestinians and what are the limits of the Palestinian problem? The first centres on the composition of a Palestinian delegation that would hold talks with Israel in Cairo. Mr Rabin has suggested including Palestinians deported by the Israelis. This would satisfy demands by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for delegates from outside to underline the principle that the Palestinian issue deals with a whole people. At the same time, Israel could maintain they were still legally residents of the occupied territories. But Mr Shamir has given no sign of softening his opposition to any contact with the PLO, or with Palestinians from outside, including those deported for activities hostile to Israel. And the depth of his ideological commitment to maintaining Israel's hold over the West Bank rules out any acceptance of the principle that negotiations should eventually lead to an exchange of land for peace. Israeli troops killed four Palestinians yesterday and a fifth was beaten to death by fellow Arabs for alleged collaboration with Israel, Reuter reports. Lebanese MPs scrape rust off government machinery From ROBERT FISK in Taif, Saudi Arabia IT IS difficult to know who is the more isolated: the 62 members of the Lebanese Parliament or the 73 members of the Lebanese press corps. Lebanon's MPs \\u2014 31 of them Muslims, 31 of them Christians \\u2014 have left the militia leaders behind in Beirut to keep the peace. The MPs are here to scrape the rust off the derelict machinery of government, to recreate the corroded institution that will have to elect a president and produce a government which can impose its rule on Lebanon \\u2014 and on the militia leaders. Hence the isolation. Closeted in the conference palace at Taif \\u2014 itself built by a Lebanese-born millionaire \\u2014 the MPs found themselves unable to exercise their normal function of playing to the gallery. Lebanese parliamentary sessions have to be open to the public. They also, by law, have to be held in Beirut. So this was therefore called \\u2018an informal meeting of Lebanese parliamentarians\\u2019\\u2014 which effectively closed the doors of their marble debating chamber to the press. In equal isolation at the Intercontinental Hotel, 16 miles away, Lebanese journalists found themselves restricted to the parliament's two opening statements and a diet of gentle assurances from Prince Saud al-Feisel, the Saudi Foreign Minister, that optimism was the order of the day, but while he had heard of some disputes in the parliamentary chamber, he had every reason to believe the Lebanese would accept the Arab League peace plan. Christian MPs close to General Michel Aoun wanted to talk first about a Syrian withdrawal, in according with the general's instructions. And it is perfectly clear that the old representatives of Lebanese democracy are under considerable pressure to talk about reform and not withdrawal. Saeb Salam made this perfectly evident. Mr Salam, 84, a Sunni Muslim, is the most impressive of Lebanon's dying breed of elder statesmen, but his words could have been those of a much younger man. \\u2018It is not appropriate to insist upon an immediate Syrian withdrawal,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We must admit that a Syrian withdrawal could provoke many dangers for which no one would want to take responsibility. This is true, regardless of the opinion that some people have of Syria, and of their unhappiness at Syria's presence in Lebanon. Among the dangers that this could bring about would be the emergence of small concessional states governed by the militias.\\u2019 All this was shorthand for a simple warning: that if the Syrians pull out of west Beirut, the militias would go to war again in its streets, and there would be nothing the Christians could do about it. Coach death From ROBERT FISK in Taif, Saudi Arabia (First Edition) LYONS (AFP)\\u2014 A British girl, Yvonne Brigden, 16, was killed and two other Britons were injured when their coach collided with two lorries in southern France on Saturday. Boris is back From ROBERT FISK in Taif, Saudi Arabia MOSCOW (Reuter)\\u2014 Thousands of Soviet television viewers yesterday heard Boris Yeltsin, the Communist Party rebel, warn of a \\u2018revolution from below\\u2019 if radical economic changes did not happen within a year. His remarks, during his recent US tour, were shown only days after Pravda reprinted \\u2014 and then apologised for \\u2014 an Italian newspaper article accusing him of drunkenness and high-living during the trip. Afghan rockets By AHMED RASHID KABUL \\u2014 Fifteen mujahedin rockets slammed into residential areas of Kabul over the weekend, killing 10 people and wounding 27, writes Ahmed Rashid. Heavy fighting was also reported around the city of Khost. The government said three soldiers were killed in a nearby village, and 41 guerrillas died in a retaliatory attack. Party time By AHMED RASHID BULAWAYO, ZIMBABWE (Reuter)\\u2014 Joshua Nkomo, 72, threw a huge birthday and 40th wedding anniversary party at the weekend and President Robert Mugabe was there to seal the unity between the former rivals. During the two-day festivities at Barbourfields stadium, politicians and business leaders, city workers and Matabeleland villagers, ate and mingled. Iran quake By AHMED RASHID TEHRAN (AFP)\\u2014 At least 300 homes were destroyed in an earthquake which shook the south-western Iranian town of Sisakht on Mount Dena early yesterday, the news agency IRNA reported. Most of the damage was caused by landslides. Japan poll By AHMED RASHID TOKYO (Reuter, AFP, AP)\\u2014 Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, scored an important victory in a parliamentary by-election in Ibaraki prefecture, north of Tokyo, yesterday. Thus, Mr Kaifu is likely to be re-elected president of his Liberal Democratic Party next month, and retain the post of prime minister. Turnaround By AHMED RASHID ISLAMABAD (Reuter, AP)\\u2014 The Queen has sent a message to Pakistan, welcoming its formal return to the Commonwealth. Nicholas Barrington has ceased to be Ambassador, and is now High Commissioner. When the plaque on the home of the \\u2018British Ambassador\\u2019 was removed, the words \\u2018Residence of the British High Commissioner\\u2019were found on the back, a relic from 1972 when Pakistan left the Commonwealth in protest at its recognition of Bangladesh. Libyan medal By AHMED RASHID NICOSIA (Reuter)\\u2014 Libya has awarded Charles De Gaulle the medal of the Great al-Fateh Revolution for campaigning to free France from \\u2018American imperialist domination\\u2019. Outback protests By AHMED RASHID SYDNEY (Reuter)\\u2014 Police arrested more than 200 anti-nuclear protesters at a military base in the south Australian outback yesterday, bringing the total detained to nearly 500 in three days of protests. Chemical Mace was used against the demonstrators at the US-Australian communications installation at Nurrungar, and the police were backed up by 50 unarmed soldiers. Talks with ANC held in Britain By JOHN BULLOCH LONDON \\u2014 A group of prominent white South Africans, including Wimpie de Klerk, brother of President FW de Klerk, began a series of meetings with the banned African National Congress in Britain yesterday, writes John Bulloch. The ANC team was led by Thabo Mbeki, the organisation's chief of information and the man regarded as a likely successor to Oliver Tambo. Reports in South Africa said a number of members of the Broederbond, the secret Afrikaner pressure group, were included in the talks, as well as individuals known to be close to Gerrit Viljoen, the Constitutional Planning Minister. It is his task to try to involve black leaders in negotiations on constitutional reform. Kohl party expected to lose again By JOHN BULLOCH BONN (Reuter)\\u2014 Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats suffered their fourth successive election setback this year in voting yesterday in North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany's most populous state. Computerised projections showed the party's share of the vote for regional and city councils had fallen to 37.9 per cent from 42.2 per cent in 1984. The Social Democrats increased their share slightly to 43.1 per cent from 42.5. The World This Week By FIONA LENEY THERE WILL be little cause for celebration when East Germany marks the 40th anniversary of its founding on Saturday. The government is planning lavish festivities to entertain all the friends that it claims to have. But the jamboree could well turn into one of those parties where half the guests fail to turn up, and everyone else tries terribly hard to pretend that they are having a marvellous time. Unsurprisingly, among the \\u2018friends\\u2019 attending will be the Romanian President, Nicolae Ceausescu, and the Czechoslovak leader, Milos Jakes. The Chinese will also be represented, by their Vice-Prime Minister, Yao Yilin. More interesting will be the presence of Mikhail Gorbachev, whose reforms are viewed with disapproval and alarm in East Berlin. Also attending will be Poland's President, Wojciech Jaruzelski, considered by East Germany as one of Communism's sounder sons who has gone lamentably astray in handing power over to non-Communists. A different sort of jamboree, arguably of greater use to mankind, kicks off in Oslo on Thursday, when the Nobel Peace Prize is announced. One of the candidates this year is the entire population of Peking, apparently in keeping with the tradition of off-beat nominees for the prize. The 1989 awards are each worth \\u00a3300,000, 20 per cent more than last year, due to particularly good returns on investments made by the Nobel Foundation. Hungary's Communist Party is expected to formalise radical political and economic changes at its special congress on Friday. The congress has been brought forward by a year, in what is being interpreted as a victory for the leader of the reformist wing of the party, Imre Pozsgay. He is reportedly hoping to oust Karoly Grosz as General Secretary. The party may well face further depletion with the expected defection of some members to set up yet another social democratic opposition party. Mr Grosz, 59, has been overtaken, some would say swamped, by the wave of reforms he unleashed after displacing Janos Kadar as Hungarian leader in May 1987. Now he finds himself in the same position as his predecessor \\u2014 a relative conservative whose time is past. The Pope, a conservative whose grip on the reins of power has never been firmer, is setting off on a tour of the Far East on Friday. He will start in Seoul, where he is to officiate at the 44th International Eucharistic Congress. He will also celebrate mass for about one million Korean faithful and 20,000 clergy members and laymen from 120 foreign countries in a ceremony on Sunday. The Pope is expected to meet President Roh Tae Woo. A more controversial moment may come when he visits East Timor, since the Vatican refuses to recognise the annexation of the island by Indonesia. The Soviet Defence Minister, Dmitri Yazov, visits the Pentagon today for a meeting with the US Defence Secretary, Dick Cheney. His visit is the first by a Soviet defence minister to the US. He is due to get a comprehensive view of the country this week, from watching marines train in California and visiting the 82nd Airborne Division in North Carolina, to a touch of military tourism on the site of the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg. EC foreign ministers, meeting today, have already drawn up their battle-lines over the much-vexed topic of safeguarding European culture on television. They will be debating a European Commission directive which only calls on EC television stations to screen a majority of European programmes, where possible. The British, perhaps sensitive to intense American lobbying over the issue, want to adopt the directive as it stands. The French want a mandatory minimum level imposed of 60 per cent of programmes made in Europe. If no accord is reached by Friday, the directive will die anyway, under a time limit rule. Botswana goes to the polls on Saturday, when seven parties will contest 34 seats in the country's single chamber. President Quett Masire is expected to be nominated again as the presidential candidate of the Botswana Democratic Party, which has ruled since independence in 1966. Finally, a special celebration takes place on Friday, when the famous Parisian cabaret, The Moulin Rouge, celebrates its 100th birthday. Genscher cheered as 4,000 refugees leave for the West From EDWARD LUCAS in Prague EARLY yesterday morning, the increasingly squalid West German embassy in Prague finally disgorged its cargo of more than 4,000 dirty, dazed and exhausted East German emigrants. Conditions and hopes at the embassy had been declining rapidly, given the apparent reluctance of Czechoslovakia to contemplate even a temporary humanitarian solution to ease the overcrowding. Early on Saturday evening, however, while Prague seemed sunk in its customary weekend torpor, West Germany's veteran foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, arrived unannounced, hotfoot from the United Nations. From a balcony overlooking the embassy grounds, and to wild cheering from the thousands of would-be emigrants in the \\u2018tent village\\u2019 below, he announced all those staying in the embassy would be allowed to leave immediately for the West. The deal Mr Genscher struck with his East German counterpart, Oskar Fischer, remains as unexplained as it was unexpected. Many of the East Germans assumed West Germany had again dug into its pocket to \\u2018buy out\\u2019 East Germans seeking to come to the West. Better informed sources suggested Soviet pressure on East Germany was responsible for the climbdown. Others pointed to the inevitable and embarrassing shadow the embassy occupation would have cast over next weekend's celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of East Germany. But the questions were forgotten in a scramble to cram grubby possessions into muddy rucksacks and carrier bags, and then stream out of the embassy to queue for buses in the long, cobbled, dimly-lit street. For some, it was the first step outside the embassy grounds for three months. An end-of-term atmosphere, tempered by extreme exhaustion, prevailed. People embraced and wept, promising to stay in touch, only to realise in some cases that they had no addresses to exchange. Some sang \\u2018Auld Lang Syne\\u2019, and \\u2018Tannenbaum\\u2019. West German tourists and Czechoslovaks gathered on street corners to cheer and wave as seven chartered Czechoslovak buses began many hours of ferrying the East Germans to the distant suburban rail terminus where trains arrived through the night to take them to West Germany. Women with children were in the first buses. Even when, after several hours, the majority of emigrants had set off, a group of young men wearing track suits remained in darkness at the back of the embassy, helping the most recent arrivals over the railings. At Liben railway station in the northern outskirts of Prague, East Germans queued cheerfully in drizzle for more than an hour to enter the departure hall. Most were content to contemplate their deliverance, but some were more boisterous. Young men carrying home-made West German emblems chanted \\u2018Long Live Germany, Long Live Genscher\\u2019. Few appeared perturbed at beginning a new life in such unusual circumstances. Many of the emigrants are skilled workers confident of their job prospects. By far the greatest worries were those of divided families. A small group was reported to have stayed in the embassy in the hope of avoiding separation from friends or family en route from East Germany. Yesterday morning the police, conspicuous but inactive in past weeks, blocked East German latecomers from access to the embassy garden. The embassy grounds, emptied of their temporary visitors, were unrecognisably battered. The once crowded white and khaki tents sagged emptily over mud. A sour smell of overcrowded humanity hung in the air. The embassy gardener is said to be planning \\u2018to start again'. Prayers and protest over Chernobyl From EDWARD LUCAS in Prague MINSK (Reuter)\\u2014 A thousand people packed the main Catholic church here yesterday to pay tribute to victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, a day after an unprecedented protest march through the city. Kalvariskii Church overflowed with people, many wearing armbands with radioactivity symbols. They sang hymns and said a prayer for the 31 people who died and those who suffered from radiation in the April 1986 accident. \\u2018We must not forget the sufferings that occurred,\\u2019 the priest, Yan Adamovich, told the congregation in Polish and Byelorussian. Hundreds of people stood outside unable to get in. Similar services were scheduled for later in the day in the Byelorussian capital's two Orthodox churches. On Saturday, more than 15,000 demonstrators ignored an official ban and rain to march through Minsk demanding local authorities do more to clean up the Chernobyl accident. For four hours they chanted \\u2018Down with (Yefrem) Sokolov\\u2019\\u2014 the republic's party chief \\u2014 and cheered calls for the prosecution of those running the republic's government at the time of the disaster. Around 100,000 people were evacuated from the Ukraine and Byelorussia immediately after the disaster, but Byelorussian activists say this was not nearly enough. Latecomers who continue to hope From ANNE APPLEBAUM in Warsaw DOZENS more East German refugees arrived outside the West German embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the West, including some who missed by only a few minutes a train that took more than 800 of their compatriots to West Germany. Many of the new arrivals, who waited in the street outside the embassy, said they were convinced there would be another train for them. The one they missed pulled out from Warsaw's East Station at 2.50am yesterday carrying 809 cheering East Germans bound for the Rhine region of West Germany. Once upon a time another German government let Lenin cross another Germany in a sealed train on his way to Russia. More than 80 years later, Lenin's heirs are allowing refugees from their Communist regime escape in the opposite direction, in an East German-made train travelling across East German territory. Among those leaving was Cornelia, 22, a young East Berliner destined, she said, for West Berlin via a very circuitous route. \\u2018I still don't know if my family know where I am or if they will suffer from my decision. But I saw no other way out: I didn't know if I would ever have a chance again.\\u2019 Some of the refugees had been living in Polish exile for as long as seven weeks, while others arrived only a few hours before West German diplomats announced they could leave. Only two failed to go: a new mother and her child, who was born in a Polish hospital four days ago. The East German government's decision to let the refugees leave across their own country came as a surprise to many, including some West German diplomats. Some of the refugees originally refused to touch East German territory again, but were reassured when two of the West German diplomats said they would accompany the train, to ensure that the rules were followed. During the journey, East German officials will enter the train, and collect all East German passports. West Germans will then issue new ones. Legally, the refugees have been expelled from East Germany, meaning that under current rules they cannot return. According to unofficial reports, the arrangement was designed by the West German Foreign Minister, Hans Dietrich Genscher, the new Polish foreign minister, Krzystof Skubiszewski, and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, who met recently at the United Nations in New York. Communists allow burial of Montenegro's last king From MARCUS TANNER in Cetinje, Yugoslavia THE PEOPLE of Montenegro yesterday welcomed home the remains of Nicholas I, their first and last king, after 70 years' exile in Italy, in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament. Thousands of Montenegrins, many in national costume, waited at the quayside in Bar for the Italian warship that would bring him home. Then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountains to the old royal capital of Cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there. What was surely the last ever Montenegrin \\u2018royal event\\u2019 was masterminded by the republic's new Communist leadership, which has abruptly stopped describing Nicholas as a class enemy, to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept Serbia in the recent celebrations of the 600th anniversary of the battle of Kosovo. The latest biography now calls him \\u2018an outstanding statesman, warrior and man of letters\\u2019. \\u2018If I die abroad in exile, let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland,\\u2019 said the Montenegrin President, Branko Kostic, reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in Cetinje Square, who carried flags and portraits of Nicholas and his queen, Milena. \\u2018Today the people of Montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided by innate love and respect for their history,\\u2019 he went on. \\u2018Our tourist organisations are counting on big profits,\\u2019 said Srdan Darmanovic, a member of the Montenegrin Central Committee. \\u2018This will be good for the Montenegrin economy too.\\u2019 Montenegro's young and go-ahead leadership, which came to power this year amid furious popular dissatisfaction with the \\u2018old men in grey suits\\u2019, sponsored the gathering of Nicholas's surviving relatives \\u2014 the first \\u2018royal reunion\\u2019 organised by a Communist government. \\u2018A letter dropped through the post from the President of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, inviting me to the funeral,\\u2019 said John Kennedy, a Conservative Party member who lives in Barking and is a distant relative of Nicholas. Montenegro's sudden rehabilitation of Nicholas's memory is a popular move. \\u2018He liberated us from the Turks and fought for our independence,\\u2019 said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarchs, visiting Serbian bishops and television crews. Marko Radoman, 103, and a veteran of both Balkan wars, was given a place at the front as one of the few with personal memories of Nicholas's reign. For a man whom Rebecca West, a contemporary Balkan observer, called \\u2018repulsive\\u2019 and \\u2018treacherous\\u2019for deserting his Serbian son-in-law, King Alexander, in the First World War, it is a sepia-tinted view of history. Nicholas was known as \\u2018the uncle of Europe\\u2019 for his success in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughters into the grander royal houses of Russia, Serbia and Italy. This furthered his long-term ambition to rule a large \\u2018south Slav\\u2019 kingdom when the Ottoman Empire finally collapsed. One daughter, a grand duchess of Russia, even gained a footnote in history by introducing an unknown monk, Rasputin, to the Russian Tsarina Alexandra. In his minute, inaccessible capital, which today has only 15,000 inhabitants, Nicholas erected a miniature European court and an exquisitely furnished Victorian palace. He even persuaded 12 European powers to turn cottages into full embassies. It was a fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described as \\u201844 hovels\\u2019. But Nicholas's grand design collapsed in 1918 when his Serbian son-in-law, Alexander, deposed him and incorporated Montenegro into Yugoslavia. For church and state it's divorce \\u2014 Italian style From MICHAEL SHERIDAN in Rome EVEN THOSE students of Italian Catholic politics enchanted by Byzantine matters are nostalgic this autumn for the days when schism was a simple affair. Important changes are afoot within the network of personal relationships which have cemented state and church power in Italy since the war. The church hierarchy, which daily seems to see less that is Christian in the Christian Democrat party, is divorcing itself from its traditional allies. Ironically, it is the proconsuls of that great exemplar of Vatican influence, Giulio Andreotti, Prime Minister for the sixth time, who are exciting church disapproval. His faction has triumphed over the reformist elements of Christian Democracy, headed by the ousted leader and premier, Ciriaco De Mita. In the sweetness of victory, Mr Andreotti's Roman cohorts have forgotten that they are mortal and, in the eyes of many churchmen, their greed and arrogance now risk bringing Catholic politics into disrepute. The Pope's Vicar of Rome, Cardinal Ugo Poletti, has taken to scolding the Christian Democrats for their divisions which may bring victory for the secular parties and the Communists in city elections on 29 October. A public rift in Catholic politics surfaced last week when the Communion and Liberation movement severed its ties with a powerful weekly magazine, Il Sabato, run by Andreotti supporters. The magazine exploited popular Catholic themes, such as anti-abortion campaigning and family values to channel middle-class resentment into a political movement. The movement promoted single-issue politics but invariably delivered its machine vote to the Christian Democrats. The Pope's initial enthusiasm for its stridency has waned, as has his toleration for the way Rome is governed beyond the Vatican walls. \\u2018A place with corners that resemble the Third World\\u2019 was his verdict this year on the city's mixture of new private affluence and public squalor, its Mafia-like interest groups and its grotesque inefficiencies. His newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, spared no criticism of the Christian Democrats who divided the spoils in city hall. The mayor, Pietro Giubilo, had to quit in the face of corruption allegations involving companies linked to Communion and Liberation. He was never more than the creature of Mr Andreotti's key fixer, Vittorio \\u2018The Shark\\u2019 Sbardella. Yet Mr Andreotti moved smoothly into the premiership. One senses that people do not trifle with \\u2018The Shark\\u2019, whose background is in the seedier recesses of legal neo-fascism. Between the embarrassment of frank sleaziness, the vicious campaigns of Il Sabato against Mr De Mita (then a serving prime minister) and the evidence of its own eyes, the Italian church began distancing itself from both Communion and Liberation and Mr Sbardella. Frightened, Communion and Liberation has now disowned Il Sabato, removing its directors and leaving the weekly in the hands of Mr Sbardella. The Bishops applauded. Mr Andreotti's supporters may triumph in the elections. But their patron, though ensconced in the Prime Minister's palace, is clearly more estranged from the mainstream of Catholic politics than at any time in his 40-year career. It is a sin for which neither absolution nor salvation may readily be forthcoming. Bush's tax cut tests Democratic mettle From JOHN LICHFIELD in Washington DEMOCRATIC leaders will make desperate attempts this week to prevent President Bush from claiming a Congressional majority for conservative economic policies, similar to the one enjoyed by President Reagan in his early years. The Democratic leadership in the Senate is anxious to reverse the handsome victory by Mr Bush in the House of Representatives last week, when 64 Democrats voted with the Republicans to sweep through a two-year cut in capital gains taxes. Senator George Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, said yesterday that he was confident that the senior house of Congress would dismantle the temporary tax cut. Congressional officials predict, however, that a truncated version of the tax break will pass the Senate this week, allowing the White House to trumpet a one-two victory over the relatively untried Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill. Such a victory would also permit Mr Bush to claim a Republican-conservative Democrat working majority in Congress for his \\u2018no new taxes, growth will solve everything\\u2019 economic policy. It would, however, leave prospects for medium-term, or even short-term, progress in solving the federal budget deficit more confused than ever. The dispute has left the bipartisan efforts to reduce the deficit in, at least temporary, tatters. The Republicans claim that the capital gains cut (from 28 per cent to 19.6 per cent for two years) would stimulate investment and create jobs. The Democratic leaders insist that the cut is an unwarranted giveaway to the wealthy which will have no significant effect on the economy and deepen the deficit. In reality, the squabble is more over slogans and symbols left over from the Reagan years than anything substantial. This begs the question why the Democrats and the White House are staging such a divisive quarrel, at a time when agreement on a deficit-cutting budget for 1990 is already overdue (the nominal deadline passed yesterday). Some pundits suggest that the capital gains tax battle is a shrewd White House softening-up exercise for an even more aggressive assault on the Democratic leaders in the next two to three weeks, designed to force a 1990 deficit-cutting agreement on Republican terms. This flies in the face of the cautious nature of the Bush administration. Congressional sources believe the White House saw the chance for a quick, psychologically valuable victory over the Democratic leaders. Ecuador holds drug lord From JOHN LICHFIELD in Washington BOGOTA (Reuter)\\u2014 Colombia was reported yesterday to be seeking the extradition of a suspected cocaine baron held in neighbouring Ecuador as a wave of bombings, believed to have been carried out by drug traffickers, continued. Police sent a five-man mission to Ecuador to bring back Evaristo Porras Ardila, the most important figure detained in the government's six-week crackdown, according to the daily El Tiempo. Mr Porras, considered a chieftain of the Medellin cocaine cartel, was arrested on Thursday in the northern town of Tulcan, about 10 miles from the Colombian border, and was to be handed over to Colombian authorities \\u2018as a show of Ecuador's support\\u2019 for the drug crackdown, an Ecuadorean spokesman said. News of Mr Porras's arrest followed the explosion of 13 bombs at the weekend, some of which damaged six schools in Bogota. Two teenage girls and a woman were hurt. In Medellin, a three-week lull in bombings was broken on Saturday night when a dynamite blast damaged two telephone control boxes. Baby deaths \\u2018due to crack\\u2019 By JOHN LICHFIELD WASHINGTON \\u2014 The city's infant mortality rate has surged to the level of some Third World countries, largely as a result of cocaine-addiction among young women, writes John Lichfield. Some 169 Washington babies died before their first birthday in the first six months of this year, bringing the capital's infant mortality rate to 32.3 deaths for every 1,000 live births, a 50 per cent increase on 1988. This is more than triple the national average, itself one of the worst in the developed world. Health officials blame the increasing use by women of crack, the smokable form of cocaine. Smoking crack during pregnancy can cause low birth-weight, respiratory problems and premature labour. In acute cases, the babies are born addicted to cocaine. Officials also blame last year's Congress decision to ban the public funding of abortions in Washington. They say drug-abusing mothers who would previously have had an abortion are bearing sickly babies with low chances of survival. The city's baby death rate now compares with that of Argentina, Venezuela, Thailand and Paraguay.\",\n          \"Paula smiled, enjoying her sister's discomfort \\u2014 and the feeling of power it gave her. \\\"Yes,\\\" she said, \\\"it is.\\\"\\n\\\"I see you have a new friend.\\\"\\nPaula nodded at the figure standing beside the bed.\\nIt was tall for a man, dressed in a black robe that reached down to his ankles. His skin was pale and wrinkled like old leather, but there were no crow's feet or lines around his eyes. He had a shaved head with dark brown hair growing out of it, and a face as smooth and unlined as that of a child's. But his eyes were dead black, without even the faintest spark of life within them. They stared into hers, cold and empty. She felt herself being drawn toward him, like a moth attracted to a flame.\\n\\\"This is Brother Samuel,\\\" said Paula. \\\"He's here to help me.\\\"\\nThe figure smiled, showing large, pointed teeth. Then he turned and walked over to the window, where he stood looking down on the courtyard below.\\nSuddenly Paula realized what she must look like: naked and alone, except for a monster. A monster who had killed countless numbers of people simply because they didn't want him around. A monster whose hunger for blood would never be satisfied.\\nShe grabbed at the sheet, pulling it up and covering herself. \\\"What do you think you're doing?\\\"\\nSamuel turned and looked at her, a smirk playing across those dead lips. \\\"You will find this more comfortable once you get used to it.\\\" With that he disappeared through the open doorway.\\n\\\"No!\\\" Paula shouted after him. She tried to follow, but found that her legs wouldn't move. Her arms refused to budge either, leaving her unable to cover herself properly. She began screaming at the top of her voice, tears streaming from her eyes.\\nSomeone ran to her side. It was Irene, crying too. \\\"I'm sorry,\\\" she sobbed. \\\"I couldn't stop him. Please don't hate me.\\\"\\nPaula pushed her away. The girl fell back onto her knees, clutching her hands together and rocking backwards and forwards.\\n\\\"Get out,\\\" Paula snapped. \\\"Go back to your stupid church and leave me alone.\\\"\\nIrene began to cry harder. \\\"I thought we were friends... I thought we could trust each other...\\\"\\nPaula grabbed hold of one of her wrists and yanked her to her feet. \\\"Get out! Now!\\\"\\nThe girl nodded, then quickly hurried out of the room. Once she was gone, Paula lay back down on the bed and closed her eyes. For a moment she was tempted to follow her sister.

He moved closer to her and reached out with both hands, as though about to touch her cheeks. \\\"We shall see how long you can last.\\\"\\nWith that, he picked up the tray and carried it from the room.

Levin's \\u2018Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord\\u2019. This essay traces the development of cinema as a form for political action through the work of the Situationist International (SI), whose films were made both by members and non-members, including a number of women, such as Agn\\u00e8s Varda. The SI used film to create situations that would disrupt the spectator/audience\\u2019s relationship with what they see on screen \\u2013 most famously by staging an invasion of a screening room at the Centre Pompidou during the opening night of its inaugural exhibition in 1977.\\nLevin argues that Debord, who was a member of the SI until 1962, understood the importance of film as a medium with which to critique contemporary society; although he disagreed with the SI\\u2019s use of mass media to do this. The SI\\u2019s first film, Critique de la vie quotidienne (1956), which explores the relationship between capitalism and everyday life, seems almost quaint when compared with the more violent stunts performed by the Red Army Faction in Germany in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, it was important for Debord and the SI in introducing the idea that art could be used as a weapon against capitalism. As Levin points out, the film was \\u2018a bold act of counter-insurgency\\u2019.\\nIn his essay, Levin also discusses the way the SI turned away from filmmaking after 1963. He suggests that this may have been due to the fact that film had become a mass medium in France, thus diminishing its ability to create \\u2018situations\\u2019 in which spectators became aware of their own participation in a particular moment. In 1974, the SI announced that it would cease all activities, but some of its members continued to produce books, including Debord himself, who died in 1994. Today, the SI is seen as one of the most influential groups of artists of the postwar period, and its legacy continues to be felt. It is clear, however, that while Debord was an important figure in the development of cinema as a tool for political activism, there are still many unanswered questions about how we can use the medium to challenge contemporary social structures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2 Epochs\",\n          \"8 Epochs\",\n          \"BNC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The goods never arrive.\\nDet Supt Craig Mackey, of the Metropolitan Police Service, said many of those involved in shoplifting were young people who had been drawn into crime because they wanted to impress friends.\\n\\u201cI think a lot of young people get involved in shoplifting because it\\u2019s quite easy to do and you can make some money out of it,\\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\\u2019s Today programme.\\n\\u201cYou may not actually want to go down a career in crime but you might be asked to do something. And I think that\\u2019s what draws young people into it.\\u201d\\nDarren Ellis, of the British Retail Consortium, said: \\u201cRetail crime has become more sophisticated over the years with fraud increasingly prevalent and organised gangs targeting retailers.\\n\\u201cWhile we welcome the NPCC\\u2019s proposals, we need the government to introduce legislation to crack down on organised retail crime.\\u201d\",\n          \"Name badges are worn by staff.\\nAll visitors should report to the school office on arrival where they will be asked to sign in and wear a visitor\\u2019s badge.\",\n          \"How they always wanted to know what other men did. They were intrigued by the intimate details of their lives, especially when it came to sex.\\nI\\u2019ve had a couple women say to me: \\u201cSo tell me, how many times do you think about sex a day?\\u201d\\nMy answer was usually something like, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t count or anything, but probably at least once an hour.\\u201d\\nAnother time, my wife asked me if I ever fantasized about having sex with someone else. She\\u2019s a little jealous, and I suppose she has good reason to be, but I told her that I didn\\u2019t even consider it. There are a lot of beautiful women in this world, but there is only one woman who means everything to me.\\nThis is also true for guys. Sure, we might have a crush on a girl at school or work, and sometimes we let our imagination wander off into the land of sexual fantasy. But I can assure you that we never actually go through with it. We would never cheat on our wives or girlfriends. It wouldn\\u2019t happen.\\nThat\\u2019s why, whenever I hear a guy talking about his favorite porn star, I want to smack him upside the head. We all have preferences, sure, but none of us are willing to take our relationship with another person to that level.\\nBut since some people don\\u2019t seem to understand this, here are 5 things that every guy secretly wants from you.\\n1) He Wants You To Be Open With Your Feelings\\nAs much as we hate to admit it, we love it when girls open up to us emotionally. Whenever I\\u2019m really comfortable around a girl, I start telling her stories about myself\\u2014stories that I normally keep bottled up inside.\\nWe need to feel that you care about us, not just physically. If you want to make your man happy, then show him that you can share your feelings with him too.\\n2) He Wants You To Be Sexually Active\\nThis goes without saying, right? Everyone knows that men get turned on by sexy women.\\nBut sometimes we have to remind ourselves of that fact. It\\u2019s easy to forget because most guys spend so much time thinking about their penises that they lose sight of the rest of their bodies.\\n3) He Wants To See What Else Is Out There\\nAsking your man if he\\u2019s been with any other women doesn\\u2019t mean that you\\u2019re trying to catch him out. In fact, it shows that you trust him enough to ask such a personal question.\\nThe truth is, most men will lie if you ask them straight out whether they\\u2019ve slept with anyone else. So instead, try asking him what kind of women he finds attractive. This way, you\\u2019ll find out whether or not he thinks you fit into his ideal type.\\n4) He Wants To Hear About His Past Relationships\\nYou might not realize it, but hearing about past relationships is super important to us. Not only does it help us learn more about each other, but it gives us insight into our own character flaws.\\nWhen we talk about our exes, we tend to focus on what went wrong between us rather than what made them special. And while this information isn\\u2019t always useful (because no matter how bad things got between you two, there must have been something good somewhere), it still helps us grow as individuals.\\n5) He Wants To Know That He Matters To You\\nIn order to feel appreciated, men need reassurance that they matter to others. Even though we may appear confident on the outside, deep down inside we still worry about whether or not we matter to those closest to us.\\nIf you\\u2019d like to let your man know how important he is to you, simply tell him that you love him! Whether he says it back or not, hearing those words will go a long way toward making him feel loved and accepted by you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2 Epochs\",\n          \"4 Epochs\",\n          \"8 Epochs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

That error is the belief that there are only two possibilities for any event: either it will happen or it won\\u2019t. This is wrong. In fact, every event has three possibilities: it can happen, not happen or happen with modifications. The problem with this belief lies in the fact that we always think about events as if they were things, when in reality they are processes. Events have duration, time is necessary for them to take place and what happens at one moment doesn\\u2019t necessarily continue without interruption. Therefore the same event can happen again (or not) in different moments of its process, i.e. the event can have different outcomes in different times.\\nWe are used to thinking about objects as solid, stable entities, but this way of thinking is wrong when applied to events. For example, let\\u2019s imagine that you are on holiday and you are visiting some beautiful city. You enter a building and walk through it looking at all the paintings and statues. Then suddenly you notice something strange: one of the statues seems to be moving! When you look closer, you see that the statue has moved to another position; and you realise that your eyes deceived you because now everything looks normal again. What happened was just an illusion caused by the passage of time: since you had been observing the statue for a few seconds, you noticed that it moved from one position to another. If you had stayed in front of it longer, you would never have seen anything unusual.\\nIt is precisely this kind of experience that many people use as evidence against the existence of God. They say \\u201cHow could God exist if he allows suffering? Why does God permit evil?\\u201d These are questions that can be answered only by someone who understands how the universe works. It\\u2019s like asking \\u201cWhy do planets go around the sun? How did life originate? Where does energy come from?\\u201d These are questions that science cannot answer because they require knowledge beyond human comprehension. But there are other questions about God\\u2019s existence that don\\u2019t require such answers\\u2014questions like \\u201cIs God good? Is God loving? Does God care about me?\\u201d\\nThese questions may seem silly at first glance, but once you start thinking about them seriously, you realize that they deserve serious consideration. And indeed they deserve serious consideration because they involve issues related to morality and ethics\\u2014two topics that concern everyone regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.\\nWhen we talk about God being good, we mean that he acts according to certain principles which define what is good and bad in our world. A good person would never kill another human being except under extreme circumstances where no other alternative exists. Likewise, a good person would never lie, steal, cheat, or harm others unless absolutely necessary to save his own life or the lives of others. So if God acts according to these principles then he must be good too.\\nThis brings us back full circle to the idea of free will: if God knows everything then he knows whether or not we will do something right away before we do it ourselves. But then why does he allow us to choose freely? Isn\\u2019t this simply a contradiction?\\nIn order to explain why God gives us freedom despite knowing ahead of time what choices we will make, we need to consider another important aspect of divine omniscience: temporal continuity. As I mentioned earlier, every event has three possible outcomes: success/failure, modification/non-modification, or repetition/non-repetition. Since God knows everything, including future events, he sees each outcome separately rather than seeing all possible outcomes simultaneously. Thus when he observes my choice to buy ice cream instead of pizza, he does not see both options happening simultaneously; instead he sees only one option happening at a given point in time (i.e., after making my decision). Because of this temporal separation between causes and effects, there are cases where God knows ahead of time that I am going to buy ice cream but still lets me decide whether or not I want to do so. He wants me to exercise my free will freely so that I feel responsible for my actions. By doing so, I gain valuable experience and learn important lessons about myself and others.\\nBut sometimes God intervenes directly into my life because he knows that I need help. For instance, suppose that I am driving down the highway late at night when suddenly I lose control over my car due to fatigue or distraction and end up crashing into another vehicle. At that exact moment\",\n          \"Indeed,\\u2019 Corbett stirred, staring behind the nun into the mist, \\u2018they may have slept more deeply than they ever intended.\\nThe silence and stillness was such that Corbett could hear a pin drop on the floorboards of the darkened room.\\n\\u2018Naughty boys!\\u2019 the nun exclaimed in a voice so soft it was barely audible above the wind, \\u2018you should not have left your books lying around.\\u2019\\nCorbett turned back to the nun, his mouth agape, but all he saw was a flurry of black habit and white bonnet disappearing through the doorway into the night beyond.\\nWithout another word, Corbett picked up his candle, opened the door and stepped out into the cold, damp air. The woodland beyond had been completely engulfed by fog, there was no moonlight, and all he could see was the faint glow from the dying embers of the fire.\\nHe walked forward into the forest, looking for some sign of the missing children, but nothing moved or made a sound. In fact, the entire world seemed frozen, as if a giant hand had descended upon the earth. He felt uncomfortable, as though someone were watching him, and he paused, turning slowly round.\\nNothing was there.\\nHe walked on, his footsteps echoing with an eerie squeak against the bark of the trees. It was then that something caught his eye \\u2013 a flash of silver in the darkness. There was a small lake at the centre of the forest, and its surface was rippling with movement, as if tiny beings were moving beneath its surface. As he drew nearer, he realised that the movement was caused by fish jumping out of the water, one after the other, as if something were disturbing them.\\nHe stopped in his tracks, his heart pounding, suddenly feeling very alone and exposed. What was causing this disturbance? Was it a bear, or perhaps a wolf? Perhaps a wild boar, or even a pack of wolves? His mind raced as he considered what might be lurking in the shadows, wondering whether to turn back to safety.\\nJust then, he heard a noise like a low growl coming from deep within the woods. It was followed by a terrible screeching sound, as if something large were being torn apart. Then, suddenly, a figure appeared before him: a tall, thin man dressed in long robes, whose face was obscured by a hood. The man held a long staff in one hand, and raised it high over his head, as if about to strike down upon something.\\nCorbett felt a wave of fear wash over him as he watched the strange man advance towards him. He tried to flee, but his legs would not move, and he found himself rooted to the spot. He tried to speak, but his throat was paralysed by terror. And then, without warning, the figure leapt towards him, its staff raised high above its head.\\nCorbett closed his eyes, expecting to feel the blow. Instead, he felt only a gentle touch on his arm. When he opened his eyes again, the man was gone. But as he looked around him, he noticed that the movement in the water had ceased, and the fish lay still on the lake bed below.\\nAs he stood there, in the quiet darkness, he thought about what he had seen. It had been a terrifying experience, but also a curious one. Who was the man in the robe, and what had he meant when he touched him? Had he really saved Corbett\\u2019s life? Or had he merely struck out at the fish?\\nHe would never know the answer. But one thing was certain: whatever else might happen tonight, he would never forget those words spoken by the mysterious figure: \\u201cI will see you again.\\u201d\",\n          \"Their reactions can range from anger to irrational guilt, fear and embarrassment. These emotions often lead to substance abuse, which in turn leads to legal problems. A criminal defense attorney who specializes in drug charges is able to help your family member understand the potential consequences of their actions so that they can make informed decisions about how to proceed.\\nIn addition to facing jail time or fines for a conviction on drug possession charges, there are other potential consequences. These include:\\nLoss of employment opportunities. If you have been charged with possessing drugs at work, you may lose your job as well as any future opportunities to find new employment because most companies conduct background checks before hiring employees.\\nDamage to relationships with friends and family members.

But in the United States,\\nwhere an employer may fire workers for any reason or no reason at all,\\nit is not clear that it is good politics to emphasize that labor's\\nprincipal demand is a restriction on the rights of employers. The\\nproblem becomes acute when we turn our attention from the general case\\nof workers seeking jobs to specific cases where workers are already\\nemployed but want more pay, shorter hours, better benefits, and so on.\\nIt seems self-evident that if, as in the European Union, there are laws\\nthat say what employees can be paid, how many hours they must work, and\\nso forth, then there will be less discretionary power in the hands of\\nmanagers. One might even argue that the very existence of such laws\\nincreases the probability that an employee will get a raise or better\\nworking conditions; after all, it is easier to get a raise than it is\\nto start over with a new job. If this is right, then an increase in\\nthe number of employment protections has a significant effect on\\nwages. In other words, by increasing the degree of economic freedom\\nthat working people enjoy, unions make them richer.\\nThis much, I think, should be intuitively obvious to anyone who has\\never worked for someone else. When you ask your boss for more money,\\nmore time off, or a change in some other aspect of your job, he or she\\nhas to take into account the possibility that you will quit and go\\nsomeplace else. It would seem that if you have a legal right to do so,\\nthen your bargaining position improves, because your employer will know\\nyou could find another job without having to look very hard. Indeed,\\nthis is precisely why many large companies try to avoid giving their\\nworkers the right to strike: they don't like the idea of being able to\\nfire only half their employees if they feel the need to do so. Of\\ncourse, workers who want to unionize rarely want to strike anyway, so\\nthe argument against the right to strike is usually made on grounds of\\neconomic efficiency. This doesn't mean, however, that these arguments\\nare unrelated to the question of whether or not employees should have\\na \\\"right\\\" to quit their jobs whenever they want.\\nBut the interesting thing about the argument against the right to\\nquit is that it assumes that the existing system of worker protection\\nis adequate. That is, the claim is that if we just give employees the\\nright to quit, they will exercise it indiscriminately and thereby\\nundermine the whole structure of labor relations in which they are\\ncurrently embedded. It is implicit in this view that there is nothing\\nwrong with the way things stand now, that there is nothing wrong with\\nworkers being subject to the arbitrary decisions of managers.\\nThis, of course, is exactly the kind of political analysis that\\nfascist movements always engage in. The fascists always begin with the\\nassumption that capitalism works pretty well and that the problem lies\\nwith certain groups within society (communists, Jews, intellectuals)\\nwho wish to undermine it. Hence, one of the central goals of fascist\\nregimes is to limit the scope of the institutions through which those\\ngroups express themselves politically, and this includes the right to\\norganize and collective bargaining. The fact that fascist governments\\nhave never been friendly toward unions or organized labor is merely an\\nindicator of their essential anti-democratic character.\\nI am not arguing that unions are perfect, or that they should be\\ngiven carte blanche to impose whatever demands they please. All\\npolitical organizations are flawed, and labor unions are no exception.\\nThe point is simply that there is a difference between criticizing\\nthe flaws in a particular organization and denying the legitimacy of\\nthe entire enterprise itself. To the extent that labor unions reflect\\nthe interests of ordinary workers, it makes little sense to attack\\nthem as a class. If they don't, then they aren't really representative\\nof ordinary workers, and there is no point in supporting them. But\\nwhether or not a union represents its members isn't something that\\ncan be established by empirical observation alone.

The animal has been introduced into many countries in Europe since 1927, where it has become an invasive species with considerable impact on agriculture and wildlife habitat. The Coypu is notoriously difficult to control due to its burrowing habits and large litters of young.\\nCoypus are native to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and have been introduced to many other countries including Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the USA. They first reached Britain in the early 20th century when they were released as a potential source of fur and food. However, once the animals had established themselves in the wild, their population grew rapidly and they soon became pests, damaging crops, ditches, river banks and waterways. The Coypu is now regarded as one of the most destructive invasive species in Europe.\\nIn order to deal with this problem, various methods have been tried over the years, ranging from trapping and poisoning to shooting and hunting. Despite these efforts however, the Coypu population remains high in some areas. This is partly because the animals reproduce quickly; females can give birth to up to eight litters per year each containing between four and twelve young. In addition, Coypus are highly adaptable creatures which means they can survive in a wide range of habitats. As such, they continue to pose a threat to farmland and natural ecosystems across Europe.\\nTherefore, if you see a Coypu rat on your property, it is important to act quickly in order to prevent further damage being caused. The best way to do this is by calling in professional pest controllers who will be able to deal with the infestation safely and effectively. With their help, you can rest assured that your home or business premises will be free from these pesky intruders for good!\\nCategories Rat Control Tags coypu rat, coypu rat control Post navigation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2 Epochs\",\n          \"4 Epochs\",\n          \"8 Epochs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ACA\",\n          \"FIC\",\n          \"NEWS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Scanner appeal co-ordinator Jack Froggatt said: \\u2018The town centre bombings raised awareness of the need for a scanner in Warrington and money has been coming in much quicker since then.\\u2019 It is now hoped to reach the \\u00a31m target by the autumn.\",\n          \"Name badges are worn by staff.\",\n          \"Profits of the Bisto-to-Mr-Kipling-cakes giant have nose-dived from \\u00a3150m to just over \\u00a392m with big bites taken out of both bread and cakes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Owen waited. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the corporal at last, looking out over the river to where a low mud shoal raised its back above the water, grey and wrinkled like a hippopotamus, \\u2018it was there.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018it's not there now.\\u2019 It had been a long, hot, fruitless morning. And now this! He boiled over. \\u2018If this is some joke \\u2014\\u2019 The watchman looked as if he was about to burst into tears. \\u2018But, effendi, it was there, I saw it.\\u2019 \\u2018Or thought you did.\\u2019 \\u2018Foolish man!\\u2019 said the corporal, swiftly switching sides. \\u2018It was all a dream.\\u2019 He gave the watchman a push. The watchman pushed him back. \\u2018It was no dream!\\u2019 he insisted. \\u2018I saw it with my own two eyes. A woman, on the sandbank.\\u2019 \\u2018A woman!\\u2019 said the corporal. \\u2018There, what did I tell you! It is time you got another wife, Abu. Then you would stop having these foolish dreams.\\u2019 \\u2018I saw it plainly. On the sandbank.\\u2019 \\u2018You saw something plainly,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018It was a woman,\\u2019 insisted the watchman doggedly. \\u2018A heap of camel dung!\\u2019 scoffed the corporal. \\u2018In the middle of the river?\\u2019 said the watchman angrily. \\u2018Anyway,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018it's not there now.\\u2019 \\u2018It was there.\\u2019 \\u2018Then what has happened to it?\\u2019 \\u2018Perhaps,\\u2019 suggested the corporal, \\u2018the river has washed it away?\\u2019 Owen looked up and down the river. It stretched, broad and placid, to the horizon on both sides. Further on down, near to the city, a single felucca was gliding gracefully in towards the bank. It came to rest and then there was nothing else moving in the intense heat of the late morning Egyptian sun. He scanned the water's edge carefully. At this time of year, with the flood still some weeks off, the Nile had shrunk back into its bed, uncovering a wide strip of mud, now baked hard and dry and cracked like crazy paving. Far away he thought he could see some goats grazing. But there was no suspicious heap lying grounded in the shallows, no flotsam or jetsam at all. Anything that came ashore would be snatched up at once by thrifty beachcombers. Under his feet a little floating clump of Um Suf, Mother of Wool, papyrus reed, torn loose from its moorings hundreds of miles to the south, nestled along the bank and came to rest against the shoal. Nestled and stuck. The current was not even sufficient to tug it loose again. \\u2018It can't have!\\u2019 said the watchman angrily. \\u2018It was Lying right up on the shoal.\\u2019 \\u2018How did it get there, then?\\u2019 asked the corporal. \\u2018Did it jump up there like a fish?\\u2019 This was exactly the kind of non-issue that Owen didn't want to get involved in. In fact, he didn't want to get involved in any of this at all. \\u2018This isn't anything to do with me,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018This is not for the Mamur Zapt.\\u2019 \\u2018Quite right, effendi!\\u2019 said the corporal smartly. \\u2018Only a woman.\\u2019 That was not what he had meant. \\u2018This is a matter for the Parquet,\\u2019 he said. This was an ordinary crime if ever he'd seen one. And ordinary crimes were handled by the Parquet, the Department  of Prosecutions of the Ministry of Justice. The Egyptian legal system was like the French. Conduct of a criminal investigation was the responsibility of a prosecuting lawyer, not of the police. The police worked under his direction. And, of course, when a crime was reported they were the ones who had to notify the Parquet in the first place. \\u2018Has the Parquet been notified?\\u2019 he said sternly. The corporal scratched his head. \\u2018I expect so,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Expect so?\\u2019 Owen boiled over with fury. \\u2018I should bloody well expect so, too. And I'd expect them to be here. I'd expect them to be wasting their time on this foolish nonsense and not me. Whose idea was it to send for the Mamur Zapt anyway?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know anything about it,\\u2019 said the corporal hurriedly. \\u2018One said that you were near, effendi,\\u2019 said the watchman forlornly, \\u2018and the Chief thought \\u2014\\u2019 Owen knew damned well what the District Chief had thought. He had thought, here was somebody senior he could pass responsibility to without having to do anything about it himself. Right on the spot, too! He wouldn't even have to stir out of the cool of his office. While he, Owen, was tearing around all over the place like a bloody lunatic! \\u2018Tell the Chief,\\u2019 he said ominously, \\u2018that I'll be wanting a word with him.\\u2019 This was ridiculous. He couldn't afford to be spending his time here. He had a dozen men on the other side of town waiting for him. They had been about half way through when the message had come from the District Chief. He had dropped everything and left. And you could bet that the moment he'd left they'd sat down in the shade. He set off back up the bank. After a moment's hesitation the other two ran after him. \\u2018Effendi! Effendi!\\u2019 \\u2018You stay here. Wait for the Parquet. You can tell it all to them.\\u2019 He reached the top of the bank, lizards scattering out of the way in front of him. He was just about to plunge back into the streets when he saw someone running towards him. It was one of the men he had left. \\u2018Effendi!\\u2019 he gasped. \\u2018A message! From the Bimbashi!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 \\u2018You are to go to the river.\\u2019 Owen looked round. Behind him the river sparkled placidly in the sun. Apart from the corporal and the watchman, there wasn't a soul in sight. Nothing moved on the bank or out on the water. The mud shoal and its hump dozed tranquilly in the heat. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018I'm at the river. But why on earth\\u2026?\\u2019 The Bimbashi arrived shortly afterwards. He was in a motor-car. This was impressive since there were relatively few cars in Cairo in 1909 and the police force itself did not boast one. Normally it went about its business either on foot or in an arabeah, the horse-drawn cab distinctive to the city. If it needed a car it borrowed the Army's one. But that was battered and sober: this one was new and, well, spectacular. \\u2018Green,\\u2019 said the driver of the car, noting with satisfaction Owen's interest. \\u2018There was a bit of a fuss about that. The Mufti complained. But I said: \\u2018It's almost the family colour, isn't it?\\u2019\\u2019 The Bimbashi, McPhee, pink and fair and anxious, rushed forward. \\u2018This is Captain Owen, Prince. Owen, Prince Narouz.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018The Mamur Zapt. You got here quickly. Efficient of you. But then \\u2014\\u2019 he smiled ambiguously \\u2014\\u2018we know the Mamur Zapt to be efficient, don't we?\\u2019 He was perhaps in his late, perhaps in his early thirties. All the males of the Khedive's family tended to thicken out  and age suddenly as they approached middle age. Owen knew from the title that this was a member of the Egyptian Royal Family but which of the Khedive's numerous progeny it was escaped him for the moment. The third person in the car was another Egyptian, definitely about thirty, slim and dressed, like the Prince, in a smart, European-style suit but with the usual pot-like tarboosh of the Egyptian professional on his head. Owen knew who this one was. His name was Mahmoud el Zaki and he was one of the Parquet's rising stars. They embraced warmly in the Arab fashion. They had worked together often and got on well. The Prince and McPhee had walked on to the top of the bank and were standing looking down at the river. \\u2018What's all this about?\\u2019 whispered Owen. \\u2018Don't know. Someone else was going to do this one and then they suddenly switched me on to it.\\u2019 They joined the others. \\u2018What's going on?\\u2019 Owen asked. McPhee turned a concerned face towards him. \\u2018Something absolutely frightful has happened,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018The Prince was on a dahabeeyah last night coming back from Karnak and someone fell overboard.\\u2019 \\u2018A woman?\\u2019 McPhee nodded. \\u2018As soon as we got the report we suspected \\u2014 well, we knew, I suppose. She couldn't swim.\\u2019 \\u2018You got the report?\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince phoned Garvin first thing this morning.\\u2019 Garvin was the Commandant of the Cairo Police force. McPhee was his deputy. \\u2018What about the Parquet?\\u2019 \\u2018We got the report in the ordinary way,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018At that stage it was just that a body had been found. I imagine,\\u2019 he said to the Prince, \\u2018that you yourself rang up later?\\u2019 \\u2018After I had spoken to Garvin.\\u2019 The Prince hesitated. \\u2018You see, I didn't want this to be\\u2026clumsily handled.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, of course not!\\u2019 said McPhee sympathetically. \\u2018The poor girl! And the family, of course!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. And the Khedivial connection.\\u2019 \\u2018Of course. Of course.\\u2019 \\u2018It could be embarrassing, you see. Politically, I mean.\\u2019 \\u2018For you?\\u2019 asked Owen. The Prince looked at him coolly. \\u2018For the Khedive. There is no particular reason why it should be. There is nothing, shall I say, to be embarrassed about. But you know what the Press is and people are. It could be used. Turned against the Khedive. Used to discredit him. Would the British Government want that, Captain Owen?\\u2019 \\u2018Assuredly not. The Khedive is a valued friend and ally.\\u2019 Not only that. He was the facade which concealed the realities of British power in Egypt. For while the Khedive was the apparent ruler of Egypt, the country's real ruler, in 1909, was the British Consul-General. His rule was indirect and unobtrusive. The Khedive had his Prime Minister, his Ministers and his Ministries. But at the top of each Ministry, alongside each Minister, was a British \\u2018Adviser\\u2019 and all the key public posts were occupied by Englishmen. Like the Commandant and Deputy Commandant of the Cairo Police. Like the Mamur Zapt. \\u2018That's what the Consul-General thought too,\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018I spoke to him this morning.\\u2019 \\u2018We are to give whatever help we can,\\u2019 McPhee told Owen. \\u2018How far does the help extend?\\u2019 asked Owen. The Prince smiled. \\u2018Not as 6r as you are evidently supposing,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I appreciate that someone has died. The matter must be investigated and will be most ably, I am sure, by Mr el  Zaki, here. If a crime has been committed \\u2014 oh, negligence, say \\u2014 those responsible must be punished. It's all straight and aboveboard, Captain Owen, and Mr el Zaki's involvement should be a guarantee of that.\\u2019 \\u2018I have complete confidence in Mr el Zaki.\\u2019 \\u2018Quite. But, you see, there is the other dimension too. The political one. The case needs to be handled from that point of view too. It needs to be\\u2026managed.\\u2019 \\u2018I see. And you would like me to provide that management?\\u2019 \\u2018Who better?\\u2019 Owen could think of lots of people he would prefer to see handling this particular case. Most people, in fact. The Prince was watching his face. \\u2018It's not as bad as all that,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We're not asking you to do anything you shouldn't. It's mainly a matter of controlling the Press.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not easy to control the Press on something like this. It's bound to get out. In a foreign newspaper, perhaps.\\u2019 In cosmopolitan Cairo with its three principal working languages and at least a dozen other widely used ones people turned as readily to the overseas press as they did to the native one. More readily, for the former wasn't censored. \\u2018That's why I spoke of\\u2026management.\\u2019 \\u2018I see.\\u2019 \\u2018Good!\\u2019 said the Prince briskly. \\u2018Then that's all sorted out.\\u2019 He looked down at the river bed below him. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I suppose we ought to go down. You'll be needing an identification.\\u2019 \\u2018There's just one thing,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Not there?\\u2019 said the Prince incredulously. \\u2018Not there?\\u2019 echoed McPhee. Mahmoud did not say anything but started immediately down the slope. By the time they got there he was already talking to the watchman. \\u2018I don't understand,\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018Are you saying that this is all a mistake?\\u2019 \\u2018A body was reported,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018A false report?\\u2019 Owen shrugged. The watchman fell on his knees. \\u2018It was true, effendi,\\u2019 he protested vehemently. \\u2018I saw it. I swear it. On my father's\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018I begin to doubt,\\u2019 said the Prince coldly, \\u2018whether you had a father.\\u2019 The watchman swallowed. \\u2018It was there, effendi,\\u2019 he said, pointing to the shoal. \\u2018There! I swear it.\\u2019 \\u2018Then where is it?\\u2019 The watchman swallowed again. \\u2018I don't know, effendi,\\u2019 he said weakly. \\u2018I don't know.\\u2019 \\u2018The river, effendi,\\u2019 insinuated the corporal sotto uoce. \\u2018It could be the river.\\u2019 Bur the Prince had already turned away. \\u2018This is awkward,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018It could have been somebody else,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018It needn't have been the girl.\\u2019 \\u2018The report was of a woman's body.\\u2019 \\u2018Another woman, perhaps.\\u2019 The Prince shrugged. \\u2018Unlikely, I would have thought. Unless you have women's bodies floating down this part of the river all the time.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh no, effendi,\\u2019 said the corporal hastily. \\u2018Awkward,\\u2019 said the Prince again. \\u2018It would have been much more convenient\\u2026 Well, it must be somewhere. You'll have to find it, that's all.\\u2019 \\u2018I'll get on to it right away,\\u2019 promised McPhee. \\u2018I'll alert all the police stations \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Quietly,\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018If that's possible with the police.\\u2019 \\u2018There's a bend below the city,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018It will probably turn up there.\\u2019 \\u2018Have someone looking out for it,\\u2019 ordered the Prince. \\u2018This needs to be handled discreetly.\\u2019 He looked at Owen. \\u2018You're managing this. Remember?\\u2019 Owen and Mahmoud were left on the river bed. \\u2018Like it?\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018But then, there's quite a lot I don't like.\\u2019 He called the watchman over. \\u2018Come here,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You saw the body. Describe it.\\u2019 \\u2018It was a woman.\\u2019 \\u2018Clothed?\\u2019 \\u2018Of course!\\u2019 said the watchman, shocked. \\u2018It mightn't have been. What was she wearing?\\u2019 The watchman looked down at his feet, embarrassed. \\u2018Shintiyan,\\u2019 he muttered. \\u2018Trousers?\\u2019 said the corporal, unable to restrain himself. \\u2018Oh ho, Abu, this is the stuff of dreams!\\u2019 \\u2018Colour?\\u2019 \\u2018Pink,\\u2019 muttered the watchman. \\u2018She was not a village woman, then?\\u2019 \\u2018No, effendi.\\u2019 The watchman shook his head definitely. \\u2018What else was she wearing? A tob?\\u2019 The watchman hesitated. \\u2018I think so, effendi. It was hard to tell.\\u2019 The corporal guffawed. \\u2018He only saw the shintiyan!\\u2019 \\u2018She wore something, though, apart from the shintiyan?\\u2019 'Oh, yes, effendi. It was just the way she was Lying,\\u2019 he said aside to the corporal. \\u2018That's how I came to see them.\\u2019 The shintiyan were ordinary trousers, not undergarments, and came right down to the ankle. \\u2018How was she Lying?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. The watchman lay down on the sand and put his arms together over his head. His body formed a kind of crescent. \\u2018There's a hump on the shoal,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018She was Lying round that.\\u2019 \\u2018Show me.\\u2019 They splashed out to the shoal. The water was shallow and hardly came up their knees. The shoal was some twenty feet long, and about four feet wide. At the downstream end it rose into a little hump. \\u2018She was Lying round that,\\u2019 said the watchman. \\u2018Head that side, feet this.\\u2019 \\u2018The body probably caught up against it on its way downstream,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Well, yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Possibly. But you can see from the mud that normally the upper part of the shoal is above the water.\\u2019 \\u2018The wash of a boat? The Prince's boat?\\u2019 \\u2018Possibly.\\u2019 Mahmoud examined the mud carefully. \\u2018We'll have to get the trackers out here,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I can't see anything.\\u2019 \\u2018Does it matter?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018If anything happened, it happened on the boat. Where the body finishes up is neither here nor there.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Except that there's one thing I find puzzling. I can accept that the body might have been carried high up on to the shoal by an exceptionally heavy wash from a boat. But I find it hard to believe in a second exceptionally heavy wash from a boat in the same morning \\u2014 one so heavy as to carry the body off again.\\u2019 Owen had to go back to his men. He found them, as he expected, doing nothing. They were supposed to be carrying out an arms search. In fact, they were chatting peacefully in the shade. He put them back to work. The tip had come from a  reliable source. You didn't waste things like that in his business. According to his informant, the arms had come into the quarter the previous day. The consignment was substantial, at least two donkey-loads. It would be hidden in the quarter until the necessary deals were struck and the arms could be distributed. For a consignment as large as that hiding-places were limited. The houses in this poor part of town were single-storey, one-room affairs and there was seldom any furniture in the room. The men would simply come into the room, stand and look. Usually they concentrated their attention on the roof. The roofs were flat and used for storage: onions, maize stalks, cattle dung being dried out for fuel, firewood. It was under the firewood that arms were usually hidden. The men would run up the outside staircases and make straight for that. By now, though, the sun was directly overhead and on the roofs it was unbearably hot. It was hot even to step on them. The men winced as their bare feet touched the plaster and Owen could feel the heat even through the soles of his shoes. That was the trouble about missing a couple of hours. If he had not been called away it would have been done by now. The men were beginning to slow down. He went round chivvying. Two men were taking a suspiciously long time on a roof. He went up to see what they were doing. He had maligned them. They were working. Like many of the roofs, this one had a dovecot. It consisted of large earthenware pots stacked on top of each other on their sides so that the mouths all pointed one way like a battery of guns. The doves flew in at the mouths and made their nests inside. The trouble was that a number of the birds were inside  now and the constables, country boys, were conscientiously taking them out one by one before feeling around inside. \\u2018That's all right,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You don't need to do that.\\u2019 \\u2018You told us to check everything!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, but \\u2014\\u2019 He was forced to admit they were right. It could be a possible hiding-place. Though only for pistols. \\u2018Don't do them all,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Just try a few. Otherwise you'll be here all day.\\u2019 \\u2018We don't want to miss anything,\\u2019 one of them said, reaching unhurriedly into another pot. \\u2018Yes, but we want to get a move on.\\u2019 \\u2018Sure!\\u2019 they agreed equably. They were some of the men he had borrowed from the local District Chief. Out here on the edge of the city life was still close to that of the village and the pace was very different from what it was further in. He thought it would probably confuse them if he insisted on their moving on. Instead, hoping to expedite matters, he squatted down beside them and gave them a hand. In the relaxed way of countryfolk, they began to chat. \\u2018Did you find what you wanted over there?\\u2019 asked one of them, inclining his head in the direction of the river. Over the houses Owen caught a glimpse of blue. \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018Nor here, either. You're not having much luck this morning, are you?\\u2019 \\u2018There's still time. If we get a move on,\\u2019 he said pointedly. \\u2018Oh yes. Things usually turn out right in the end.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, but only if \\u2014\\u2019 He stopped himself. It was pointless. One of the things he had learned since coming to Egypt was that the country had its rhythms and that if you were going to get anywhere you had to work with them and not against them. \\u2018It was a body,\\u2019 he said, changing tack. \\u2018Over there. By the river.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. Or rather, a body was reported. By the time I got there it had gone.\\u2019 The man laughed. \\u2018Bodies have a way of doing that,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Or at least, on this part of the river they do.\\u2019 \\u2018How's that?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh well, if you find one, that means more work for the Chief, doesn't it?\\u2019 \\u2018So he doesn't mind too much if one goes missing?\\u2019 \\u2018He doesn't mind at all.\\u2019 \\u2018How might they go missing?\\u2019 \\u2018All sorts of ways,\\u2019 said the man vaguely. \\u2018They might hit a pole, for instance,\\u2019 suggested his friend. \\u2018What?\\u2019 The two men laughed, as at a private joke. \\u2018They can hit all sorts of things on their way downriver,\\u2019 said the first man, looking at his friend chidingly. \\u2018But what about when they're washed up?\\u2019 \\u2018That's when they have to be reported.\\u2019 The man laughed again. \\u2018Are there people working the bank?\\u2019 \\u2018How do you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018On the lookout for things. Things that get washed ashore?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Regulars?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Are they organized? Is there a gang? A society?\\u2019 The men looked at each other, then dropped their eyes. \\u2018We wouldn't know about that,\\u2019 they said. They worked on carefully through the dovecot. When they had finished they patted the dovecot affectionately and climbed back unhurriedly down the stairs. Owen sat thinking. It was a new possibility. Suppose the body had not been washed away? Suppose it had been interfered with? Suppose somebody had got to it? Owen went to see the District Chief afterwards. He had a thing or two he wanted to tell him. To his surprise, when he reached the office he found the green car drawn up outside and the Prince about to go in. \\u2018Why, Captain Owen!\\u2019 said the Prince, pausing for him. \\u2018How felicitous! I was just making sure that everything was covered.\\u2019 \\u2018Isn't McPhee supposed to be doing that?\\u2019 \\u2018Of course. But it sometimes helps if you remind key people which side their bread is buttered on, don't you think?\\u2019 Owen wondered in what sense the District Chief was key. The District Chief was, in fact, looking rather shaken. \\u2018After all,\\u2019 said the Prince with a wave of his hand, \\u2018it's not every day that he gets called on by both Royalty and the Head of the Secret Police.\\u2019 He gave Owen a sidelong glance. \\u2018He is probably more impressed by the latter, I'm afraid.\\u2019 \\u2018I doubt it, Prince.\\u2019 \\u2018You're his boss, aren't you?\\u2019 \\u2018No. He comes under Mr McPhee.\\u2019 \\u2018Not the Mamur Zapt? Don't they all come under the Mamur Zapt?\\u2019 \\u2018No, Prince. The Mamur Zapt is, well, out to one side.\\u2019 \\u2018You, too? Of course, things have changed. In my grandfather's time the Mamur Zapt used to control everything. He was the Khedive's right-hand man, you know. The man he relied on to keep him in power.\\u2019 \\u2018I am afraid his scope is a little more restricted these days, Prince.\\u2019 The title \\u2018Head of the Secret Police\\u2019 was in any case something of a misnomer. Head of the Political Branch of the CID was the closest British equivalent. Perhaps, too, in army terms \\u2014 and some considered Egypt an occupied country \\u2014 Head of Political Intelligence. \\u2018Yes. And in the old days he used to serve the Khedive.\\u2019 \\u2018He still does, Your Highness.\\u2019 The Prince smiled. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I am sure you have business of your own with our friend here. Please don't let me interrupt you.\\u2019 He walked over to one of the low, shuttered windows and sat on the sill. \\u2018Do carry on.\\u2019 Owen hesitated. \\u2018Not secret, is it? If it is, I will at once remove myself. Though, as you said a moment ago, you are in a sense one of my servants.\\u2019 \\u2018The Khedive's servants, certainly. No, Your Highness, you are, of course, welcome to stay. I was merely going to ask the Chief why he sent for me this morning.\\u2019 \\u2018But is not that obvious?\\u2019 \\u2018No, far from it. The proper procedure, you see, when a crime is reported, is to notify the Parquet, not the Mamur Zapt.\\u2019 \\u2018I see. Well, man, answer him. Why did you send for him?\\u2019 \\u2018The Mamur Zapt was nearby,\\u2019 muttered the Chief. \\u2018Well, that seems reasonable. You were nearby. And, by the way, that was very prescient of you.\\u2019 \\u2018Hardly. I was conducting a search for arms.\\u2019 \\u2018Really? In this vicinity? There does seem to be a lot going on in this neighbourhood. Arms, you say? Well, I suppose that's important.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. To the Khedive as well as to me.\\u2019 \\u2018You think so? Yes, I suppose you're right. They're just as likely to be used against us as they are against you. We and the British have a lot in common. We're both unpopular.\\u2019 \\u2018Only with some people, Prince.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, yes. These Nationalists! Very trying people. My father keeps wondering whether to bring them in or keep them out. Bring them in and they want to change things. Keep them out and you deny them the chance to share in  our unpopularity. Which is hardly wise, don't you think? I'm all for bringing them in.\\u2019 \\u2018You could always go half way. Bring them in so that they share the unpopularity but don't give them enough power to change anything.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah yes. Of course, that is the British solution. And very effective, too. But then, what about these guns? These arms of yours? Don't you think there's a danger that if people are disappointed they're more ready to try extreme solutions? What do you do then?\\u2019 \\u2018Conduct arms searches.\\u2019 \\u2018I see. Why, Captain Owen, you've persuaded me! I am now convinced that your work was very important. Too important to be interrupted. So, fellow, why did you interrupt him?\\u2019 The District Chief, who had not altogether followed all this, looked blank. \\u2018I was wondering whether he'd received a phone call,\\u2019 explained Owen. \\u2018A phone call to suggest that there were other things more important.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, me, you mean? No. I always start at the top. I get round to the bottom later. As, of course, you see.\\u2019 \\u2018I was puzzled,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018The message from the Chief came first. Before the message from Mr McPhee.\\u2019 The Prince looked at him sharply. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018that is interesting.\\u2019 He slipped off the sill, walked across to the Chief and stood in front of him. \\u2018That is interesting. Well,\\u2019 he said silkily, \\u2018did you receive a phone call this morning?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said the Chief, \\u2018no phone calls.\\u2019 \\u2018Or any other kind of message?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Did someone come to see you, for instance?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018The Mamur Zapt will check,\\u2019 warned the Prince. \\u2018If I were you I'd get it right the first time.\\u2019 \\u2018No one came. There were no messages, effendi. I swear it. \\u2018So why,\\u2019 asked the Prince, \\u2018did you send for Captain Owen?\\u2019 \\u2018I thought \\u2014 I thought \\u2014 the Mamur Zapt was near \\u2014 and \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018There may be a simple explanation,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Laziness.\\u2019 \\u2018Laziness?\\u2019 \\u2018He heard there was someone senior in the neighbourhood and saw it as a golden opportunity to pass on the responsibility.\\u2019 \\u2018But isn't there a difficulty here? You said yourself earlier that you are not his superior, not directly. Yes, and that in any case the normal procedure was for the matter to be reported to the Parquet.\\u2019 \\u2018These are facts of which I meant to remind him.\\u2019 \\u2018I see. Good.\\u2019 The Prince wheeled away. \\u2018Carry on,\\u2019 he said over his shoulder. \\u2018Another time. Your Highness, I must apologize. I have been delaying you. You yourself had business, I think, with the District Chief?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, yes. Certainly.\\u2019 \\u2018Don't let me delay you further. Please carry on.\\u2019 He walked over to the window and sat on the sill. \\u2018Don't mind me,\\u2019 he said encouragingly. The Prince sat silently for a moment looking at Owen. Then he suddenly smiled. \\u2018Touch\\u00e9 he said. \\u2018However, I don't mind you hearing.\\u2019 He crooked his finger. The Chief came towards him. \\u2018The body that was washed up this morning: I am interested in it. If I am interested, other people will be, too. Now. One!\\u2019 He held up his forefinger. \\u2018If anyone comes round inquiring, I want to know who they are. Two!\\u2019 He held up the second finger. \\u2018You are to tell them nothing. They may offer you money. If you take it, I shall hear, and you know what to expect, don't you? On the other hand, if you report all to me it may be that I shall give you money. Understand? Three!\\u2019 He clasped the third finger. \\u2018It may be that you will come across information which you think would interest me. Information about the body, for instance. Not about the girl, I don't need that. Just the body. I am prepared to pay for such information and pay well. Now, have you got all that?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, Your Highness.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm sure you have. But just to make even surer, I am going to ask you to tell me what the three things are that could make you rich.\\u2019 He held up his forefinger and looked questioningly at the District Chief. \\u2018If people come asking,\\u2019 said the Chief hoarsely. \\u2018You are to say nothing. Good. And the second?\\u2019 \\u2018I am to tell you who they are.\\u2019 \\u2018Excellent!\\u2019 The Prince looked at Owen. \\u2018The man is well on his way to becoming rich, wouldn't you say?\\u2019 \\u2018There are sometimes dangers in trying to get rich too quickly.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, pooh! Don't be a spoilsport. The man wants to get rich. Let him have his dream! Now, fellow, what is the third thing you have to do?\\u2019 He held up the third finger. The Chief kept his eyes fixed on it. \\u2018To bring you information, Your Highness. Information about the body.\\u2019 \\u2018Good.\\u2019 The Prince patted him on the back. \\u2018Good fellow! You have learned your lesson.\\u2019 \\u2018Thank you, Your Highness.\\u2019 He seemed uncertain, however. \\u2018Well?\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018What is it?\\u2019 \\u2018I \\u2014 I \\u2014 there is a thing I don't quite understand, Your Highness.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes? What is it?\\u2019 \\u2018The body, Your Highness. You said you wanted information about the body, Your Highness.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 The District Chief hesitated, then took the plunge. \\u2018What sort of information, Your Highness? I will go and see the body if you wish and describe it to you. In detail, naturally. But \\u2014\\u2019 He looked uncomfortably to Owen for support. \\u2018No, no, no!\\u2019 said the Prince hastily. \\u2018Not that sort of thing!\\u2019 \\u2018Then \\u2014?\\u2019 \\u2018The body has disappeared,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Disappeared?\\u2019 \\u2018Gone. From the sandbank where it was apparently found.\\u2019 \\u2018Gone?\\u2019 said the District Chief, as if he could not believe his ears. \\u2018Gone?\\u2019 \\u2018That's right. When I got there it had gone.\\u2019 \\u2018Abu?\\u2019 said the Chief faintly. \\u2018Ibrahim?\\u2019 \\u2018We got there together. It had already gone. Ibrahim rather doubted it had been there in the first place.\\u2019 The Chief unexpectedly went ashen. He bowed his head between his hands. \\u2018God!\\u2019 he said. \\u2018God!\\u2019 \\u2018I want to find it,\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018Quickly, and before anyone else does. Got it?\\u2019 CHAPTER 2 Unusually, there was a meeting on the British side about how to handle it. Garvin was there, Commandant of the Cairo Police and Owen's nominal superior; McPhee, Deputy Commandant, earnest, concerned and straightforward \\u2014 too straightforward by half to be a Cairo policeman and far too straightforward for something like this; Paul, an aide-de-camp of the Consul-General's; and Owen. The Consul-General usually steered clear of too direct an involvement in Egyptian policing. Garvin reported formally  to the Khedive \\u2014 and the Consul-General was punctilious about the forms. He was particularly careful of any involvement with the Mamur Zapt, which was why Owen not only reported formally to the Khedive but was nominally subordinate to Garvin. It was, therefore, unusual to have a meeting of this sort. But then, as Paul, chairing the meeting on behalf of the Consul-General, made clear, the circumstances were unusual. \\u2018It's not every day that an heir to the throne gets involved in something like this.\\u2019 \\u2018Is he an heir to the throne?\\u2019 \\u2018One of many. The Khedive has a number of sons and all of them see themselves as potential heirs.\\u2019 \\u2018Where does this one fit in?\\u2019 \\u2018He is the son of the Khedive's third wife, so not high up in the stakes. On the other hand, his mother is still a favourite of the Khedive's, which is often significant. He is able and energetic, which makes him stand out among the Khedive's progeny. And front runners in a thing of this sort are unfortunately prone to accidents.\\u2019 \\u2018He seemed a bit of a playboy to me,\\u2019 said McPhee. \\u2018That car, of course. But look at it another way: as an indication of Narouz's interest in things modern and things Western.\\u2019 \\u2018I see.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. I thought you would. The Consul-General, and Al-Lurd before him, see him as a man England could do business with.\\u2019 Al-Lurd was Lord Cromer, the man who had run Egypt for over twenty years before the present incumbent. If two such people, the one popular with Conservatives, the other a nominee of the new Liberal Government in London, took that view, the Prince had a lot going for him. \\u2018It would be unfortunate,\\u2019 said Paul, \\u2018if he were to be derailed at this point.\\u2019 There was a little silence. \\u2018Is that a directive?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018A hint, rather. Call it: putting you in the picture. Alerting you to the position of His Majesty's Government.\\u2019 \\u2018As strong as that?\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018I can relax it a bit, provided you've got the general idea. If he's done anything really wicked I don't think HMG would be prepared to go out on a limb on his behalf. There are, after all, other possible candidates. But if it's only mildly wicked we would feel it a pity to be too legalistic.\\u2019 \\u2018What counts as only mildly wicked?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think I'd like to give you a general answer. These things have to be decided in the light of circumstances.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not sure I find that very helpful,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018What exactly is to be our position?\\u2019 \\u2018Aloof,\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018Aloof, but watching.\\u2019 \\u2018Not get too close to it? Well, that's probably sensible.\\u2019 'Should be manageable,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018After all, it's Parquet business really.\\u2019 \\u2018Quite. The police will assist the Parquet and work under their direction as usual. But that's at the local level. There's no need for senior involvement.\\u2019 \\u2018I quite agree,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018No point in that at all.\\u2019 No fool he. \\u2018McPhee's involved already,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018I think he can drop out now.\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince thinks he's involved.\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince, I believe, has changed his mind.\\u2019 \\u2018Since yesterday?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018I see.\\u2019 Someone else been making telephone calls? \\u2018I think that's very reasonable,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018McPhee's got enough demands on his time already. When all is said and done, this is just a straightforward crime and we wouldn't normally put him on to something like this.\\u2019 \\u2018We don't even know it is a crime,\\u2019 Paul pointed out. \\u2018No, no, of course not,\\u2019 said Garvin, hurriedly changing tack. \\u2018Could be just an accident.\\u2019 \\u2018It's for the Parquet to decide how it wants to treat it. Crime or accident.\\u2019 He looked at Owen. \\u2018They've put Mahmoud on to it, haven't they?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018How will be play it?\\u2019 \\u2018Straight.\\u2019 \\u2018Mahmoud's a good chap,\\u2019 said McPhee. \\u2018Mahmoud's going to have to take some hard decisions,\\u2019 said Paul. He finished his coffee. \\u2018Which brings me to the final thing we need to discuss. You asked me about the stance we were to adopt. I said aloof. I also said watching.\\u2019 \\u2018We wouldn't want it to go wrong,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018We couldn't afford for it to go wrong. We've got to have someone in there.\\u2019 \\u2018I thought you said you didn't want any senior involvement?\\u2019 \\u2018Overt. No overt involvement at the senior level.\\u2019 Another little silence. \\u2018This is hardly straightforward policing,\\u2019 said Garvin slowly. \\u2018I would say it was more \\u2014 political.\\u2019 \\u2018You said it was straightforward policing a moment ago. When you wanted to shift it to the Parquet.\\u2019 \\u2018A straightforward crime. Not straightforward policing. There are other dimensions here. Political ones.\\u2019 \\u2018I think Owen's the chap,\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018I don't like it.\\u2019 \\u2018Who does?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not going to get involved in any cover-up.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think Owen should be asked to cover up anything,\\u2019 said McPhee. \\u2018We're not asking him to. Not yet, anyway. And I don't think it need come to that, not if it's handled in the right  way. With a bit of dexterity, I mean. The Press, the politicians, the Prince himself. Mahmoud. The Khedive, too, perhaps.\\u2019 \\u2018It's a tall order.\\u2019 \\u2018I've every confidence in the boy,\\u2019 said Paul, watching him. \\u2018I still don't like it. I'm not going to get involved in any covering up. \\u2018I hope it won't be necessary. But this is politics. You know, you policemen are lucky. If you meet a bad guy, you lock him up. If I meet a bad guy I usually have to shake hands with him and do a deal.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not shaking hands,\\u2019 said Owen. Paul smiled. \\u2018You're in politics now,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018whether you like it or not. And I think you'll find you're going to have to take some hard decisions. Like Mahmoud.\\u2019 \\u2018And, of course, there was the harem,\\u2019 said the eunuch. \\u2018The harem?\\u2019 said Owen, startled. \\u2018The Prince always travels with one.\\u2019 \\u2018Even to Luxor?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. \\u2018Certainly to Luxor. The Prince has an estate there.\\u2019 \\u2018And that's where he had been this time?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 They were sitting in the cabin of the dahabeeyah. It was a modern one, specially fitted out for the Prince, and had windows. Through the window beside him Owen could see a large rat sunning itself on a mooring rope. \\u2018I had gathered the impression that the Prince had intended to be away only for a few days,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018That is true.\\u2019 \\u2018How long did he spend at the estate?\\u2019 \\u2018Two days.\\u2019 \\u2018Only two days? That is a very short time, especially when you have to travel all that way.\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince does not like his estate.\\u2019 \\u2018He was principally interested in seeing Luxor, then?\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince does not like Luxor, either.\\u2019 \\u2018What does he like?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Cannes.\\u2019 In the old days, before the advent of Mr Cook's steamers, when tourists used to sail down to Luxor by dahabeeyah, the port had been full of the old-fashioned, native sailing craft. The tourist would come and choose one. It would then be towed across the river and sunk \\u2014 temporarily. This was to get rid of the rats. The trick was, though, to sail away immediately that dahabeeyah had been raised. Otherwise it would be reinfested \\u2014 along the ropes \\u2014 at once. \\u2018What, then, was the purpose of his visit?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. The eunuch shrugged. \\u2018I wouldn't have thought the Prince was one to wish to spend a week admiring the beauties of the river bank.\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince spent his time in the cabin playing cards with the Prince Fahid.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah? The Prince Fahid was on the boat, too?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Had he, too, brought his harem?\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince Fahid is too young to have a harem.\\u2019 \\u2018He is Prince Narouz's son?\\u2019 \\u2018Nephew.\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince was perhaps showing him the sights?\\u2019 \\u2018What sights?\\u2019 \\u2018Luxor?\\u2019 \\u2018The Prince is not interested in antiquities.\\u2019 \\u2018What, then, was the point of the journey?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know. Perhaps you had better ask the Prince.\\u2019 Mahmoud sighed. He had warned Owen beforehand to expect this. The Prince's entourage wouldn't say anything. He was finding it difficult to extract even the names of the people who had been on the dahabeeyah. \\u2018Let us go back to the harem,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018How many wives has the Prince?\\u2019 \\u2018Four.\\u2019 \\u2018And they were all there with him?\\u2019 \\u2018Except Latfi, who is having a baby.\\u2019 \\u2018Three, then. There were three in the harem quarters?\\u2019 \\u2018You spoke of wives only.\\u2019 \\u2018There were others, then? How many?\\u2019 \\u2018Seven.\\u2019 \\u2018Can you give me their names?\\u2019 said Mahmoud, taking out a pencil and notebook. \\u2018I am afraid not.\\u2019 \\u2018Are you sure? You knew Latfi's name.\\u2019 \\u2018I know all their names. But it would not be proper for me to tell you the names of His Highness's wives and concubines.\\u2019 \\u2018But I need to know! I am conducting an investigation!\\u2019 'That's as may be, but a man's harem is his own affair.\\u2019 'Not when part of it disappears overboard.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018You know very well what I mean,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, exasperated. \\u2018I told you! His Highness has reported that a passenger on the dahabeeyah with him \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018But she wasn't in the harem.\\u2019 \\u2018She wasn't?\\u2019 \\u2018No!\\u2019 \\u2018What was she doing on board, then?\\u2019 \\u2018Well\\u2026\\u2019 The eunuch hesitated. \\u2018You may speak,\\u2019 said Owen encouragingly. \\u2018Mr el Zaki puts these questions with the knowledge and agreement of His Highness,\\u2019 possibly stretching the truth a little. \\u2018She was helping to entertain the princes?\\u2019 \\u2018Helping?\\u2019 \\u2018There were two others. They came on board at Beni Suef.\\u2019 \\u2018On the way up to Luxor or on the way back?\\u2019 \\u2018On the way up.\\u2019 \\u2018Have you any objection to telling me their names?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know their names,\\u2019 said the eunuch. The incident had happened on the return journey. The dahabeeyah had moored for the night and the three girls had been up on the top deck enjoying the evening breeze. They had stayed up there with the princes until it had become dark, early, of course, in Egypt. Prince Narouz, bored, had descended first. About half an hour later, according to the eunuch, Prince Fahid had followed him, accompanied, possibly reluctantly, by two of the girls. The third had remained on the top deck. And it was from the top deck, apparently, that she had disappeared. Late, quite late, someone had called up to her, asking when she was going to come down. Some time after, not having received a reply, they had sent the eunuch to fetch her. He had found the top deck empty. At first he had assumed that she had climbed down to the lower deck and gone forward. Some members of the crew had been sitting in the bows and it was only when they denied having seen her that he began to search seriously. \\u2018The steersman?\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Surely the steersman must have seen?\\u2019 On a dahabeeyah the steersman was placed aft, immediately behind the cabin. He usually stood on a little platform raised high enough to enable him to see over and past the cabins when the boat was moving. After the boat had stopped for the night there was always some work still to be done on the platform. The rudder bar had to be lashed and the ropes stowed. The eunuch said, however, that the steersman had finished his work and gone forward before all this happened. The eunuch had made a cursory search and then had reported the matter to Prince Narouz. Narouz had been angry, first with the girl for playing the fool and then with the eunuch for not finding her. He had searched the boat himself. Gradually he came to realize that something was seriously amiss. By now, of course , it was dark and hard to see anything on the water. The Prince had had all the men up on deck  scanning the river with the aid of oil lamps. Meanwhile the eunuch had been concluding a search below. When he had gone up on deck again he found that the Prince had lowered two small rowing boats and was systematically scouring the river. This had continued all night. As soon as it was light the dahabeeyah had sailed down river with everyone on deck keeping an eye out. They had seen nothing. In the end they had abandoned the search, set the Prince down so that he could report the incident at once, and sailed on to Bulak. \\u2018I shall need to speak to the Ship's Captain, the Rais,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Also to the crew. One by one. Also to the servants. Those girls, of course. Then the harem.\\u2019 \\u2018The harem!\\u2019 said the eunuch, shocked. \\u2018Certainly not! What sort of boat do you think this is?\\u2019 The dahabeeyah was moored across the river from the main port. This was the traditional mooring place for dahabeeyahs and in the old days, before Mr Cook had come with his steamers, there would have been over two hundred of them nudging the bank. They were the traditional way for the rich to travel by water \\u2014 and in Egypt everyone travelled by water. The Nile was the main, the only, thoroughfare from north to south and the dahabeeyah was its Daimler. It was a large, flat-bottomed sailing boat rather like a Thames barge or, as tourists were over-prone to comment, a College houseboat, except that its cabins were all above deck and all aft. This gave it a weird, lop-sided look and might have made it unstable had that not been compensated for by putting the hold forward. From the point of view of the tourist the arrangement had an additional delight. There was a railed-off space on top of the cabins which served as a kind of open-air lounge, sufficiently high to allow passengers both to enjoy the breeze and to see over the bank. This was important, as in some stretches of the river Mr Cook's customers might not  otherwise have benefited from the remarkable views he had promised them. Owen himself rather enjoyed the views but he had been a little surprised to learn that they had also drawn the Prince. \\u2018How long was he up there?\\u2019 he asked the Rais, the Ship's Captain, disbelievingly. \\u2018Two hours.\\u2019 \\u2018Of course, it was cool up there.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018And he was keeping the women company.\\u2019 \\u2018They were already up there,\\u2019 said the Rais. There was a note of disapproval in his voice. \\u2018Really? By themselves?\\u2019 Mahmoud clucked sympathetically. \\u2018By themselves.\\u2019 \\u2018That's not right!\\u2019 \\u2018They shouldn't have been up there at all!\\u2019 said the Rais. \\u2018There's a place for women. And it's the harem.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, but these weren't \\u2014 I mean, they weren't properly in the Prince's harem.\\u2019 \\u2018They ought to have been. And they ought to have stayed there.\\u2019 \\u2018Were they flaunting themselves?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud, commiserating. The Rais hesitated. \\u2018It was enough to be there, wasn't it? My men could hardly take their eyes off them.\\u2019 \\u2018Unseemly!\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018It wasn't proper,\\u2019 said the Rais. \\u2018The Prince should have known better. Though it is not for me to say that.\\u2019 \\u2018Have you captained for him before?\\u2019 \\u2018He's never been on the river before. At least, as far as I know.\\u2019 \\u2018So you didn't know what to expect?\\u2019 \\u2018All he told us was that he wanted to go up to Luxor. With the Prince Fahid. He was very particular about that. The Prince had his own room, of course, and Narouz wanted a cabin next to him. He didn't even want to be with the harem.\\u2019 \\u2018Strange! And then, of course, there were those other women.\\u2019 \\u2018He didn't say anything about them. Not until we were nearly at Beni Suef.\\u2019 \\u2018They were foreigners, weren't they?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not saying anything.\\u2019 \\u2018They must have been. Our women wouldn't have behaved like that.\\u2019 \\u2018Indecent!\\u2019 \\u2018Did they wear veils?\\u2019 \\u2018They wore veils,\\u2019 the Rais conceded grudgingly. \\u2018But they showed their ankles!\\u2019 \\u2018Oh!\\u2019 said Mahmoud, shocked. \\u2018How could Hassan be expected to steer when they were flaunting their ankles in front of him?\\u2019 \\u2018Impossible,\\u2019 Mahmoud agreed. \\u2018Impossible!\\u2019 They were standing in the stern of the vessel looking up at the back of the cabins. The steersman's platform, with the huge horizontal rudder bar he used for steering, was right beside them. \\u2018But I don't understand!\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018The woman who stayed up there alone \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Shameless!\\u2019 said the Rais. \\u2018Shameless!\\u2019 agreed Mahmoud. \\u2018But she was right in front of him. Surely he would have seen if she had \\u2014 well, fallen off.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, but it was dark, you see. We had stopped for the night.\\u2019 \\u2018So the steersman wasn't there?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018Where was he?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know,\\u2019 said the Rais. \\u2018You'd better ask him.\\u2019 \\u2018And where were you?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. \\u2018I was up here,\\u2019 said the steersman. \\u2018We'd finished  for the day, so I tied the rudder and then came up forward.\\u2019 They were sitting in the shade of the cook's galley. It was a small shed, rather like a Dutch oven in shape, set well up into the prow to remove it as far as possible from the passengers' cabins. The cook stood up on the forward side, so that the shed protected him when there was a favourable wind. They could hear him there now. The spot was clearly a favourite one with the crew and there had been several men dozing there when Owen and Mahmoud had appeared. They had gone aft to leave them to talk to the steersman in private, but one of them, the cook presumably, had disappeared into the galley. \\u2018She was still up there at that point?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 The steersman's wrinkled face broke into a smile. \\u2018I reckoned the midges would soon drive her down.\\u2019 \\u2018It was dark by then?\\u2019 \\u2018Just. They were up there admiring the sunset but I wanted to stop while there was still a bit of light. There are one or two things you have to do and you can always do them better if you can see what you're doing. Besides, the Prince didn't want us to go too far. He wanted another night on the river!\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, he did, did he? And why was that?\\u2019 \\u2018Why do you think? Perhaps he likes it better on the water.\\u2019 \\u2018That's what is was about, you think?\\u2019 \\u2018What else could it be? He goes down to his estate and doesn't stay there a moment, we call in at Luxor and he doesn't want to go ashore. We go straight down and straight back and the only thing we stop for is to pick up some women at Beni Suef!\\u2019 \\u2018Those women,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018what were they like?\\u2019 \\u2018Classy. But not the sort you'd want to take home with you.\\u2019 \\u2018Foreign.\\u2019 The steersman hesitated. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I don't know. Two of them were, certainly. The other \\u2014 that's the one who finished up in the river \\u2014 I'm not sure about.\\u2019 \\u2018You're sure about the others, though?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes. You could hear them talking. Mind you, she was talking with them. I don't know, of course, but it just seemed to me\\u2026well, and then there were the clothes.\\u2019 \\u2018What about the clothes?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, they all wore the tob.\\u2019 The tob was a loose outer gown. \\u2018And the burka, of course.\\u2019 The burka was a long face veil which reached almost to the ground. \\u2018But from where I was you could see their legs.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. The Rais told us.\\u2019 \\u2018I'll bet he did! He oughtn't to have seen that, ought he? I mean, he wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been looking. You'd have thought a man like that, strict, he's supposed to be \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018The women,\\u2019 said Mahmoud patiently. \\u2018Yes, well, the thing was that \\u2014 I mean, I couldn't see clearly \\u2014 but I reckon those two had European clothes on underneath their tobs. You could see their ankles. But the other one, well, I caught a glimpse. She was wearing shintiyan.\\u2019 \\u2018Pink ones?\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Why, yes,\\u2019 said the steersman, surprised. \\u2018That's right. How did you know? Oh, I suppose you've seen the body.\\u2019 \\u2018Never mind that,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Let's get back to when she was on the top deck. She was up there when you last saw her?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Alone?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Why didn't she go down with the others?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know.\\u2019 \\u2018Had they been quarrelling?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know.\\u2019 \\u2018You heard them talking.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, it was not so much quarrelling. I think the Prince  was trying to get her to do something. Like, persuade her.\\u2019 \\u2018And she didn't want to?\\u2019 \\u2018I couldn't really tell,\\u2019 confessed the steersman. \\u2018I couldn't understand the language, see? It was just the impression I got. He wasn't nasty or anything, not even angry, really. He was just trying \\u2014 well, to persuade her, like I said.\\u2019 \\u2018He didn't get anywhere, though?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018How was she? I mean, was she angry?\\u2019 \\u2018I couldn't really say. You never know what's going on behind those burkas. You think all's going well and the next moment \\u2014 bing! They've hit you with something. My wife's like that.\\u2019 \\u2018Were there any tears?\\u2019 \\u2018Tears? Well, I don't know. Not so much tears but you know how they get sometimes, you think they're going to cry and they don't, they just keep going on and on. A bit like that.\\u2019 \\u2018With the Prince? When he was trying to persuade her?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. And with the girls, too. A bit earlier. Going on and on.\\u2019 \\u2018Did they get fed up with her?\\u2019 \\u2018They left her alone after a bit. Then the Prince came up and had a try and he didn't do any better.\\u2019 He broke off. \\u2018Is this helping?\\u2019 he asked. \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Good. I like to help. Only \\u2014 all this talking!\\u2019 He suddenly pounded on the back of the galley with his fist. \\u2018What's the matter?\\u2019 asked the cook, sticking his head out. \\u2018How about some tea? I'm so dry I can't speak.\\u2019 \\u2018It sounded to me as if you were doing all right. I'd have brought you some before only I didn't want to interrupt you.\\u2019 He placed a little white enamel cup before each of them and filled it with strong black tea. \\u2018No sugar,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You'd think we'd have sugar on board the Prince's dahabeeyah but we don't.\\u2019 \\u2018It's that eunuch,\\u2019 said the steersman. \\u2018The stuff never even gets here.\\u2019 \\u2018It goes somewhere else, does it?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud sympathetically. \\u2018Into his pocket!\\u2019 said the steersman. Mahmoud looked up at the cook. \\u2018You were here that night, weren't you? The night the girl disappeared?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. I was just making supper when that stupid eunuch came along making a great commotion.\\u2019 \\u2018You left the girl there,\\u2019 Mahmoud said to the steersman, \\u2018and then you came along here. Did you have a cup of tea at that point?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the steersman, \\u2018I always have one when I finish.\\u2019 \\u2018Tea first, then supper,\\u2019 said the cook. \\u2018And you had a cup with him, perhaps?\\u2019 \\u2018I did. I always do.\\u2019 \\u2018Here? Sitting here?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. Several of us.\\u2019 \\u2018And you were still sitting here when the eunuch came?\\u2019 'l was,\\u2019said the steersman. \\u2018I had just got up,\\u2019 said the cook. \\u2018To make the supper.\\u2019 'So whatever it was that happened,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018happened while you were sitting here.\\u2019 \\u2018I suppose so,\\u2019 said the steersman. \\u2018Well, it must have.\\u2019 'Yes, it must have. And you still say you saw nothing? Heard nothing?\\u2019 \\u2018Here, just a minute \\u2014!\\u2019 \\u2018We weren't looking!\\u2019 \\u2018We were talking!\\u2019 \\u2018You would have seen a person. Or \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018We didn't see anything!\\u2019 \\u2018Two people. On the cabin roof. Together.\\u2019 \\u2018Here!\\u2019 said the steersman, scrambling to his feet. \\u2018What are you saying?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm asking,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Did you see two people?\\u2019 \\u2018No!\\u2019 \\u2018Up there together. Whoever they were.\\u2019 \\u2018I didn't see anything!\\u2019 \\u2018None of us saw anything!\\u2019 \\u2018Thirty feet away and you saw nothing?\\u2019 \\u2018We weren't looking!\\u2019 \\u2018You took care not to look.\\u2019 \\u2018We were talking!\\u2019 \\u2018And nothing attracted your attention? Someone is attacked \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Attacked!\\u2019 \\u2018Or falls. And you know nothing about it? If she'd jumped into the water she'd have made a splash.\\u2019 \\u2018A splash? Who hears a splash? There are splashes all the time.\\u2019 \\u2018One as big as this? You are boatmen. You would have heard.\\u2019 \\u2018Truly!\\u2019 said the steersman. \\u2018I swear to God \\u2014!\\u2019 \\u2018He hears what you say!\\u2019 Mahmoud warned him. \\u2018And sees all that happens. I know. Well, he may have seen what happened to the girl but I didn't.\\u2019 The steersman showed them off the boat. At the gangway he hesitated and then ran up the bank after them. \\u2018What was it, then? Was she knocked on the head?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018I thought you'd seen the body?\\u2019 \\u2018No. It's not turned up yet.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh.\\u2019 He seemed disappointed. Then he brightened. \\u2018Tell you what,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I know where it will fetch up, more than likely.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 The steersman pointed downriver to where men were working on a scaffolding which stretched out across the river. \\u2018See that? That's the new Bulak bridge. That's where they finish up these days.\\u2019 They were sharing the boat with a kid goat, a pile of onions and the boatman's wife, who sat, completely muffled in tob and burka, as far away from them as was possible. It had been the steersman's idea. They had been about to set out for the main bridge when he had said: \\u2018Are you going back to Bulak? Why don't you get Hamid to run you over?\\u2019 He had pointed along the bank to where an elderly Arab was standing in the water bent over the gunwale of a small, crazily-built boat. The sides were not so much planks as squares of wood stuck on apparently at hazard. The sail was a small, tattered square sheet. \\u2018In that? I don't think so,\\u2019 said Owen. But Mahmoud, fired with enthusiasm for the life marine, was already descending the bank. With the two of them on board, the stern dipped until the gunwale was inches above the water. The bows, with the woman and the goat, rose heavenward. The boatman inspected this critically for a moment, but then, unlike Owen, seemed satisfied. He perched himself on the edge of the gunwale and took the two ends of the rope in his hands. One he wedged expertly between his toes. The other he wound round his arm. The wind caught the sail and he threw himself backwards until the folds of his galabeah were trailing in the water. The boat moved comfortably out into the river. Now they were in midstream they could see the new bridge more clearly. There were workmen on the scaffolding and, down at the bottom, a small boat nudging its way along the length of the works. The boatman pointed with his head. \\u2018That's the police boat,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018It comes every day to pick up the bodies.\\u2019 \\u2018Can you take us over there?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. The boatman scampered across to the opposite gunwale, turned the boat, turned it again and set off on a long glide which took them close in along the bridge. \\u2018Bring us in to the boat,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. A tall man in the police boat looked up, saw Mahmoud and waved excitedly. \\u2018Ya Mahmoud!\\u2019 he called. \\u2018Ya Selim!\\u2019 answered Mahmoud warmly. A couple of policemen caught the boat as it came in alongside and steadied it. Mahmoud and the other man embraced affectionately. \\u2018Why, Mahmoud, have you done something sensible at last and joined the river police?\\u2019 \\u2018Temporarily; this is my boat.\\u2019 Selim inspected it critically. \\u2018The boatman's all right,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018but I'm not so sure about the boat.\\u2019 He shook hands with the boatman. \\u2018Give me your money,\\u2019 said the boatman, \\u2018and I'll have a boat as good as yours.\\u2019 \\u2018And the Mamur Zapt,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. Selim shook hands again and gave him a second look. \\u2018I don't think we've met,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018No. I've met Mahmoud, though. We were working on a case last year.\\u2019 He looked at them again. \\u2018The Mamur Zapt and the Parquet,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018This must be important.\\u2019 \\u2018It's the girl,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018You've received notification, I'm sure.\\u2019 \\u2018Pink shintiyan? That the one?\\u2019 \\u2018That's the one.\\u2019 \\u2018Not come through yet. When did it happen?\\u2019 \\u2018The night before last. About three miles upstream.\\u2019 \\u2018She'll have sunk, then. Otherwise she'd have come through by now.\\u2019 Owen looked out along the works. There seemed a lot of water passing through the gaps. \\u2018Could she have gone through and missed you?\\u2019 \\u2018She could. But most of them finish up against the scaffolding. In the old days before we started building the bridge they used to fetch up on a bend about two miles down. That was better for us because it's in the next district and meant they had to do the work and not us.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, but that meant they missed all the glory, too!\\u2019 \\u2018I think the average Chief would prefer to do without the glory!\\u2019 Owen laughed. \\u2018We've known a few like that!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. We sometimes get the feeling that not all the bodies that come down to us need have done.\\u2019 \\u2018You think so?\\u2019 \\u2018Sure of it.\\u2019 \\u2018It's important to pick up this one,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Yes, I'm checking them myself. We've had two women through this week. One of them's old and one of them's young, but I don't think the young one could be the one you're looking for, not unless she changed her trousers on the way down.\\u2019 \\u2018The trousers is about all we've got at the moment. I hope to add some details later. Keep the young one just in case. \\u2018It'll be some time before she's traced and identified anyway. They don't always come from the city. Sometimes it's a village upstream.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, keep her. Just on the off-chance.\\u2019 \\u2018If she's sunk, what then?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Oh, she'll come up. Gases. In the body. It'll take a day or two. Then the body comes up and floats on down to us. We get them all in the end.\\u2019 \\u2018I hope you get this one.\\u2019 They pushed off. Their boat was now downwind and they had to tack. The boatman tucked up the skirts of his galabeah, hooked his knees over the gunwale and leaned far back over the side. Owen, more confident of his transport now, trailed a hand over the side and turned his face  to catch the breeze. Beside him, Mahmoud, hands clasped behind head, was thinking. In the bows the boatman's wife sat muffled from head to foot, invisible behind her veil, anonymous. CHAPTER 3 \\u2018Does this girl have a name?\\u2019 demanded Zeinab. They were lying on cushions in her appartment. Very few single women in Cairo had an appartment of their own, but Zeinab was rich enough and imperious enough and independent enough to insist on one. The richness and imperiousness came from her father, Nuri Pasha, not quite one of the Khedive's family but certainly one of his confidants, not exactly trusted \\u2014 the Khedive, wisely, trusted nobody \\u2014 but regularly called upon when the Khedive was reshuffling the greasy pack of his Ministers. Nuri was one of Egypt's great landowners and the Khedive considered there was sufficient identity of interest between them for him to be able to use Nuri's services without fear. Zeinab was Nuri's daughter: illegitimate, but that, as he explained, was not his fault. Her mother had been a famous courtesan, doted on by all Cairo but in particular by Nuri, who, though a mature man, had taken the reckless step of proposing that she become his wife and a member of his harem. Unaccountably, the lady had refused. She was more than willing \\u2014 since Nuri was handsome as well as rich \\u2014 to extend him her embraces; but enter his harem? She was a fiercely proud, independent woman and these qualities had passed in more than abundant measure to her daughter. Nuri had gained his way on one thing. Their child had been acknowledged as his daughter and raised in his house, which gave her all the privileges and benefits of belonging  to one of Egypt's leading families. While, admittedly, these were not normally conspicuous in the case of women, for Zeinab they were substantial. Like most of the Egyptian upper classes, Nuri was a Francophile. He spoke French by preference, read French books and newspapers and followed French intellectual and cultural fashions rather than Egyptian ones. The culture of educated Egyptians was, anyway, in many respects as much French as it was Egyptian. Mahmoud, for instance, had been educated as a lawyer in the French tradition. The Parquet was French through and through. Zeinab had been brought up in this culture. Her father, finding in her many of the qualities he had admired in her mother, had given her far greater freedom from the harem than was normal and from childhood she had sat in on the political and intellectual discussions her father had with his cronies. She came to share many of his interests and tastes and as she grew up she became something of a. companion to him. All this made Zeinab an interesting woman but a rather unusual one. Men found her formidable and she advanced into her twenties, long past the usual marrying age, without Nuri having received a suitable offer. He began to think of this as a problem. It was a problem, however, which Zeinab herself solved. She moved out and set up her own establishment. Nuri, though advanced in his thinking, was rather shocked by this. Shocked but intrigued: was Zeinab taking after her mother? Zeinab, however, was merely following up some of the ideas she had met in her father's own circle. Among his friends were some writers and artists who formed a somewhat Bohemian set. Zeinab, who had strong musical interests, found their company congenial and enjoyed their artistic debates. This talk, too, was very much influenced by French fashions and preoccupations; and from it Zeinab  acquired the notion that it was possible for a single woman to set up house on her own. She did this and enjoyed it and gradually her father and his friends came to accept it; indeed, not even, any longer, to notice it. And she was living like this when she met Owen. The intensity of their relationship surprised them both. Zeinab, alarmed at herself, backed off a little and insisted on maintaining an independent life while she was working out how to handle all this. Owen, equally alarmed, was content to let it rest like that while he tried to see a way through the likely complications. Neither of them was getting very far. Meanwhile they carried on as they were and that went very well. They met every day, usually in Zeinab's appartement and Zeinab kept a proprietorial eye on what Owen was doing when he was away from her. \\u2018Of course she has a name,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018It's just that we haven't found it yet.\\u2019 \\u2018It was the way you were talking,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Well, it all sounds pretty anonymous, I know \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Until we find out more about her, it's bound to be.\\u2019 \\u2018I just ask myself,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018what kind of woman is likely to be found on Narouz's dahabeeyah.\\u2019 \\u2018And what answer do you get?\\u2019 \\u2018Someone like me.\\u2019 \\u2018What nonsense! What absolute nonsense!\\u2019 It disturbed him. \\u2018Nonsense!\\u2019 he repeated vehemently. \\u2018It's got to be someone like me, hasn't it? It can't be an ordinary girl from an ordinary family because in Egypt ordinary girls are never allowed to be seen. Not even by their husbands, until after they are married.\\u2019 \\u2018An \\u2018ordinary\\u2019 girl, as you put it, wouldn't get anywhere near a son of the Khedive.\\u2019 \\u2018No, it would have to be someone from a family of rank, wouldn't it? Like mine.\\u2019 \\u2018The same thing applies to them. They're kept out of sight, too. More, even, since they know what the Khedive's sons are like. I've been in Egypt four years and I've never seen a Pasha's wife or daughter.\\u2019 \\u2018Except me.\\u2019 \\u2018You're different. You're not at all ordinary. In fact,\\u2019 said Owen, his mind beginning to stray on to a quite different tack, \\u2018you're altogether extraordinary \\u2014\\u2019 But Zeinab refused to be diverted. \\u2018It would be someone like me,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Someone whose family is rich enough for her to meet the Khedive. Someone whose father is, well, modern enough not to care. Someone who's struck-out on her own. Someone who's vulnerable.\\u2019 Unexpectedly she began to cry. Owen was taken aback. Zeinab cried frequently at the opera, never, up till now, anywhere else. He took her in his arms. \\u2018For Christ's sake!\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You don't even know the girl!\\u2019 \\u2018I can feel!\\u2019 sobbed Zeinab. \\u2018I can feel!\\u2019 \\u2018You can get misled by feeling.\\u2019 Zeinab pulled herself away. \\u2018You don't have any feeling,\\u2019 she said, looking at him stormily. This was, however, more like the Zeinab he knew and he felt reassured. \\u2018Aren't you missing out the most likely possibility?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018That she's foreign?\\u2019 \\u2018I thought you said \\u2014?\\u2019 \\u2018It's what the steersman said. He thought she was different from the other two and they were certainly foreign. Well, she might have been different, but still foreign. And isn't that the most likely thing? You don't get the Egyptian women on their own either on the Prince's boat or off it. He's used to mixing with foreign women. Someone he's met at Cannes? I'd have thought it was pretty likely. After all, the Khedive himself \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Well, of course,\\u2019 said Zeinab, sniffing, \\u2018that's true.\\u2019 \\u2018It was the clothes, you see, that made him think she was Egyptian. The shintiyan.\\u2019 \\u2018Would a Frenchwoman wear shintiyan?\\u2019 asked Zeinab, who herself dressed \\u00e4 la Parisienne. \\u2018I certainly wouldn't.\\u2019 \\u2018Maybe to please the Prince. Or as a joke or something.\\u2019 Zeinab thought it over. \\u2018The other two were foreign, weren't they?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. And that's another thing. My guess is that they were from some cabaret or other. That's where he might have come across them. You see, you said the girl would have to come from a family of rank. Well, I don't think girls who let themselves get picked up en masse off the bank to spend a week with a bloke on a dahabeeyah arc likely to be that high class. Foreign, not too classy, three at a time \\u2014 that sounds like cabaret to me.\\u2019 \\u2018No decent Egyptian woman would let herself be subjected to such a thing,\\u2019 said Zeinab, removing Owen's hand. \\u2018So,\\u2019 said Owen, putting it back, \\u2018they must either be foreign or \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Or what?\\u2019 asked Zeinab. \\u2018Indecent Egyptian women,\\u2019 said Owen, putting his other arm round her. In front of him was a beautiful old building, very like a small mosque with its domes, its facade of red and white stones intermixed, its ornate panelling and intricate arabesques. It was not, however, a mosque but a hammam, a public bath-house. The entrance was narrow and below street level. A towel hung over the door. Owen's men looked at him inquiringly. The towel meant that the baths were temporarily occupied by women. \\u2018Leave it,\\u2019 said Owen resignedly. The men moved on. Owen made a note to return to the hammam later when the towel had been taken down. It was not, however, a good start. He was conducting yet another search of the quarter. His informant swore blind that the arms were still there. He had even been able to specify a little more precisely the area where he thought they were concealed. They were, he said, somewhere near the souk. The souk was not located, as markets usually were, in a square of its own but occupied the space created by a crossroads. Its stalls spread over the whole area successfully restricting passage in any direction. Fortunately, this far out of town, there were very few vehicles to pass. The occasional horse-cart laden with stones, the occasional hand-cart carrying ice, were the closest approximation. The Souk Al-Gadira existed only for its immediate neighbourhood. The stalls were erected and dismantled every day so there was little likelihood of the arms being hidden beneath them. They were far more likely to be concealed in one of the buildings round about and it was here that Owen was concentrating the search. They had gone through the buildings when they had searched the area previously but on that occasion, as Owen reminded himself crossly, he had been summoned away in the middle by that foolish District Chief and sent on that wild goose chase down to the river. There would be no repetition of that today, he told himself grimly. He would make damned sure they stuck with it and did the job properly. Only it was not quite so straightforward. First, there had been the hammam. And now, at the end of the street, just ahead of him, was a mosque. Again the men looked at him inquiringly. And again he hesitated. Even the Mamur Zapt entered mosques on police business with caution. It was so easy for minister and congregation to get excited. The smallest thing would set them going. The sight of a Western face was enough. Well, he could do something about that. He needn't go in himself, just send the men in. Just send the men in? The police were only slightly more grata than himself. They were seen as the agents of either an alien, infidel force (the British) or a dissolute secular power (the Khedive). In either case they were unwelcome. It needed only one irascible minister to take umbrage at some fancied slight or misdemeanour for there to be trouble. \\u2018Leave it,\\u2019 he said again. If there was trouble he'd have to spend the rest of the day putting it down and wouldn't be able to get on with the arms search at all. But this was ridiculous! First, the hammam and now this! This wasn't a search at all. Suppose the arms were hidden inside? And there would be no coming back to the mosque! He called the men back. \\u2018You two,\\u2019 he said, picking on men he had brought with him from headquarters and therefore more experienced, \\u2018you go in and walk through, keeping your eyes open. Don't cause any trouble and don't insist if they look like objecting. Just see what you can see and come back and tell me.\\u2019 The men nodded and went off. After a while they returned. One of them spread his hands, palms upward, and shrugged. \\u2018OK,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Worth a try. Get after the others.\\u2019 At least it hadn't created uproar. He moved on up the street, or would have moved on if he had been able to. The street was one of those which led into the souk and its lower end was completely blocked by stalls. Regardless of the general press of humanity, a funeral procession was attempting to pass down it from the other end. Processions, like deaths, were extremely common in Cairo and everyone stopped to look, including Owen, who was a little surprised to see a funeral so early in the day. Usually they took place in the evening when it was cooler. As funerals went, this was a very medium affair. First came the Yemeneeyeh, six poor men, mostly blind, proceeding two and two, and chanting mournfully, \\u2018There is no  God but God.\\u2019 Then there were male relations of the deceased, few in this case. Next came four schoolboys, one of them carrying an open copy of the Koran placed upon a kind of platform of palm-sticks and covered with an embroidered kerchief. As they walked, they sang: in rather more sprightly tones than the Yemeneeyeh. And then came the bier, its front draped with a shawl to indicate that it carried a woman, which perhaps accounted for the general meagreness of the proceedings. All the Cairo world loved a good funeral and the bystanders stopped what they were doing, not so much to let the procession pass but to join in the fun. But where were the dervishes, the munshids, with their singing and dancing and flag-waving? There was admittedly a fiki but he was very restrained and seemed anxious to keep himself invisible at the back. This was a poor affair indeed. Even the female mourners, who followed the bier, were few in number and boringly subdued. Disappointed, the crowd resumed its business. Which, of course, brought the procession to a halt. Owen cursed and tried to wriggle his way round, failed and had to cut across in front of the donkeys laden with bread and water to give to the poor at the tomb. The poor, judging from the size of the loads, would benefit handsomely. Once past, Owen hurried to catch up with his men. He fell in alongside two of them at the end of the street. They were the two he had talked to on the previous search, the ones who had been taking such pains with the dovecot. \\u2018Found that body yet?\\u2019 one of them asked. \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018You won't, either.\\u2019 Owen stepped aside to let a water-carrier pass with his heavy bags. \\u2018Why not?\\u2019 he asked. \\u2018It's the river. Full of tricks.\\u2019 \\u2018It'll come up some time.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah yes. But where?\\u2019 \\u2018Most of them finish up against the bridge these days, apparently.\\u2019 \\u2018Perhaps this one will too. When it gets there.\\u2019 Owen didn't quite understand this and would have asked more but the two men ducked into the next house. He continued slowly along the street, noting how long it took them. Everything was going to be under control this time. There was nothing wrong with the efforts of his men at the moment. They were working through the buildings quickly and, as far as he could tell, efficiently. They turned up the next street. It contained some taller buildings with shops on the ground floor. This would take them longer. After waiting a little, Owen sauntered on. Half way up the street was a tall sebil, or fountain-house. It was, like the hammam, an old building, dearly predating the other buildings since the street curved back specially to accommodate it. It was a delightful building. Its totally curved sides were fenced with grilles of exquisite metalwork and its upper storey was graciously arcaded. There was a little parapet going round the arcade and it suddenly occurred to Owen that it might provide a vantage-point from which he could more pleasantly monitor proceedings. He climbed up the outside staircase past the fountains surrounded by black-veiled women filling their pots with water and out on to the little parapeted promenade which crowned the second storey. From inside the arcade came the murmur of children's voices. As with many of the larger sebils, the arcaded upper storey was occupied by a kuttub, a school where little children received their first lessons on the Koran. Owen smiled. It was an unexpectedly tender insight on the part of the Arabs to accommodate their infants up here where it was airy and cool. He walked to the parapet and looked over. Down in the street he could see some of his men. They approached a house and went in. Not long afterwards, watching, he saw  them appear on the roof They looked around for a moment and then went down. From where he stood, high up, he could look down on the roofs of the houses. Most of them were flat and empty, save for the occasional bundle of firewood, the heap of vegetables, the pile of corn-stalks. One or two of the larger houses, though, had roof gardens; and, as he watched, two women came up on to one of these and began watering the plants. It was a house about two along from the one he had been looking at previously. He hoped the women would have completed their task and departed before his men arrived. Servants would probably warn them but if there was an outside staircase and his men dashed up \\u2014? He watched anxiously. The men went into the next house and worked through it. The women went on watering. The men finished the house and came out into the street. And at that moment, fortunately, the women left the roof of their own accord. Owen breathed a sigh of relief. It wouldn't have done for the women to be met by his men. That, yet again, could have caused trouble. What a country this was to police in! Mosques, bathhouses, roofs \\u2014 you could offend someone's susceptibilities by searching any of them. What were you to do? If it wasn't religion, it was women! His men, searching both sides of the street, had covered that block of houses and were now coming up the street towards the fountain-house. He went down to meet them. \\u2018That one next?\\u2019 said one of the men, indicating the fountain-house with his hand. \\u2018Of course!\\u2019 The women watched them curiously as they mounted the stairs. Owen was about to move away when one of his men appeared above the parapet and waved to him urgently. He ran up. In an inner room, beyond the chanting class, were some  sacks and packaging. The men had picked up the sacks and shaken them out. And out had fallen two new live dips of ammunition. \\u2018Of course, we're holding the teacher,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018That won't do much good,\\u2019 said Garvin scornfully. \\u2018They moved the guns this morning right in front of him.\\u2019 'This morning?\\u2019 Owen swallowed. \\u2018Yes, this morning. When we started searching.\\u2019 \\u2018I thought you had people on the lookout?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, we did. But \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018You seem to be mislaying a lot of things lately,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018First, the body. Now the guns.\\u2019 \\u2018He says that all he knows is that the men came this morning and took away the guns,\\u2019 said Nikos, Owen's Official Clerk and Office Manager. \\u2018He must know more than that,\\u2019 protested Owen. \\u2018Where the guns were hidden, for a start.\\u2019 \\u2018He says he was told not to use the room.\\u2019 \\u2018Who told him?\\u2019 \\u2018A man.\\u2019 \\u2018What sort of man?\\u2019 \\u2018The usual. Galabeeyah and head-dress. The head-dress held across his face.\\u2019 \\u2018No description?\\u2019 \\u2018No description.\\u2019 \\u2018Keep him,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018It may help him to see better. And send Georgiades down. See if he can find out anything.\\u2019 But this was bolting the door after the horse had gone. The teacher was unimportant and probably genuinely knew nothing. Georgiades questioned several other people: the kuttub's watchman, a fiki who taught there, people in the neighbouring shops, but to no avail. The fact was that the guns had been there and Owen had missed them twice. The first time because he had allowed himself to be called away in the middle of things and hadn't been able to supervise the men properly. The second time because \\u2014 well, because they had been smart enough to smuggle the guns away right under the noses of the men he had posted to make sure that didn't happen. He was back where he had started. Only this time without the guns. And still there were distractions! Mahmoud had traced the girls who had been on the Prince's dahabeeyah and wanted Owen's help in interviewing them. Owen could guess why that was. They must be foreign. Because of treaty concessions imposed on Egypt over the centuries, the nationals of certain foreign powers had legal privileges. Their houses could not be entered by the police, for instance; they had to be tried by courts of their own country, not by Egyptian courts, and so on . The definition of nationality, already elastic in this cosmopolitan country, was easily stretched and all kinds of dubious people claimed benefit of the Capitulations, as the privileges were called. It was common practice, for example, for a brothel-keeper brought before a court to claim that he or she belonged to a privileged nationality. It was possible, if the police applied to the Consul of a country, to get the exemptions waived. But by the time the police had secured the exemption and got back to the brothel, the keeper would have changed his nationality and they would have to start all over again. It was another of those things, like religion and women, that required policing to be resourceful in Cairo. If you were dealing with a foreign national it often paid to have a representative of a Great Power, like Britain, at your back. But it was probably for another reason that Mahmoud had called on him. In a sensitive case like this, where action against foreign nationals might have diplomatic  repercussions, it was wise to get the British on your side first. Owen knew this and didn't mind it. There were even advantages in that he might be able to \\u2018manage\\u2019 the affair better from the inside. All the same, just now it was a distraction. However, he went. The two girls, it transpired, did not work in a cabaret but assisted at a gambling salon. Owen thought he knew what kind of assistance that was but Mahmoud said it was not like that, or not like that entirely. \\u2018It's a very high-class salon,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018and the people who go there are more interested in gambling. They tend to be European, though, or Europeanized Egyptians and expect the social style of a club on the Riviera. There's a reception area where they can sit and talk and the girls sit in there too and help the conversation along.\\u2019 At the request of the salon's owner they met the girls not at the salon but in a hotel nearby. The salon was in the Ismailia quarter where all the best hotels were. They met in the Hotel Continental. When they arrived they were taken at once to a private alcove. Owen was amused to see that hospitality had been provided. That wouldn't get far with Mahmoud, who, strict Muslim that he was, drank only coffee. The women must already have been there, for the ma\\u00eetre d'h\\u00f4tel brought them immediately. They were dressed in discreet though well-cut black and, in deference to the customs of the country, long veils, which they put aside as soon as they sat down. One was Belgian, the other Hungarian. Their names were Nanette and Masha. \\u2018We've got other names too,\\u2019 they pointed out. Mahmoud addressed them as Mademoiselle. Yes, they had been on the dahabeeyah. They had been approached beforehand and had agreed to go to Luxor and back as members of the Prince's party. \\u2018A Prince, after all,\\u2019 said Nanette, with a roll of her eyes. Masha was less impressed. Apparently, princes were two a penny in Hungary. \\u2018What did that entail?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018What do you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018How friendly did you have to be?\\u2019 Nanette shrugged her shoulders. \\u2018So-so,\\u2019 she said. They had met Narouz previously. \\u2018He came to the salon. Not regularly. He would come several times in a week and then you wouldn't see him for ages.\\u2019 He liked talking to them, they said. Just talking. They wouldn't have minded other things too but talking was what he wanted. \\u2018He could get as much of the other as he liked,\\u2019 said Masha. \\u2018The one thing he couldn't get in Egypt, he said, was intelligent female conversation. It's the lives they lead,\\u2019 she explained. \\u2018Shut up in those harems!\\u2019 \\u2018You're not saying he came to the salon just for conversation?\\u2019 \\u2018No, no. He liked gambling. But when he wasn't playing he liked to talk.\\u2019 \\u2018Especially with women,\\u2019 said Nanette. \\u2018And it was as a result of these conversations that he invited you to join him on the dahabeeyah?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. He said it was the only thing that would get him through it.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't understand,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Are you saying he didn't want to go up to Luxor?\\u2019 \\u2018He hated going on the river at all. He said it was slow and boring.\\u2019 \\u2018Then why \\u2014\\u2019 Nanette shrugged. \\u2018He said he was doing it only because it was his duty.\\u2019 \\u2018Duty? I don't understand that.\\u2019 Nanette shrugged again. The two girls had been fetched by car, the Prince's car, from the salon and been taken to the river at Beni Suef, where the dahabeeyah had called in for them. What about the other girl? A little silence. \\u2018We didn't know her,\\u2019 said Nanette. \\u2018She wasn't one of us,\\u2019 said Masha. \\u2018Meaning?\\u2019 \\u2018She was Egyptian for a start,\\u2019 said Masha. \\u2018What kind of Egyptian? Levantine Egyptian, Greek Egyptian, Italian Egyptian \\u2014?\\u2019 \\u2018Egyptian Egyptian.\\u2019 \\u2018Are you sure?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. She told us about her family once. Her father's a big merchant or something. They have a big house. Only she doesn't live there any more.\\u2019 \\u2018Didn't,\\u2019 said Masha. Nanette shrugged again: a sudden, nervous jerk. \\u2018Where has she been living up to now?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. \\u2018With an aunt, I think.\\u2019 \\u2018Do you know where?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018We'd never seen her before,\\u2019 said Masha, \\u2018not till we got into the car.\\u2019 \\u2018She was already in the car? He'd picked her up first?\\u2019 \\u2018I suppose so.\\u2019 The girl hadn't said much, then or at any other time. She had kept herself to herself. Owen had the impression that this was the first time for her, as it certainly wasn't for the other two. From what they said, she had shrunk into a shell from the moment she had got on board, going off by herself whenever she could. \\u2018And that was why she was on the upper deck that night?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Yes. She was always up there.\\u2019 Mahmoud got them to go through the events of the night. The women had got into the way of going up on the deck  every evening. They liked it even if Narouz didn't. They had sensed the disapproval of the Rais. \\u2018But what's the point of going up to Luxor if you never get a chance to see anything?\\u2019 asked Nanette. What indeed? \\u2018Besides, after being cooped up below decks all day \\u2014\\u2019 She made a pretty moue, which, Owen decided, was probably intended for his benefit. \\u2018You were up there together,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, unsoftened, \\u2018all three?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018What were you talking about?\\u2019 \\u2018What were we talking about? I can't remember.\\u2019 The girls looked at each other. \\u2018This and that.\\u2019 \\u2018Did she join in?\\u2019 \\u2018A little. Not much.\\u2019 They had grown so used to her not joining in that they had not really noticed that she had stayed up there when they came down. \\u2018We were hoping we might have a drink before dinner,\\u2019 said Masha. \\u2018Some hope!\\u2019 said Nanette. It was when they were assembling for dinner that they had noticed her absence. They had called up to her. Narouz had even gone up. \\u2018Why he bothered I can't think,\\u2019 said Nanette tartly. They had started the first course without her. Then, as she still failed to appear, Narouz had become annoyed and sent the eunuch up to fetch her. \\u2018We thought at first that she had hidden herself deliberately,\\u2019 said Nanette, \\u2018and didn't bother too much. But then as time went by \\u2014\\u2019 It all corroborated what they had already heard. Mahmoud probed but came up with nothing more. \\u2018You know where to find us,\\u2019 said Nanette, getting up. \\u2018Any evening,\\u2019 said Masha, \\u2018except Friday.\\u2019 Owen put out his hand to stop them. \\u2018Just one other thing,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018before you go. What was her name?\\u2019 \\u2018Leila,\\u2019 said Nanette. \\u2018That was it, wasn't it? Leila.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018how are you getting on?\\u2019 \\u2018Fine. But there are just one or two things I would like to ask you,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Naturally,\\u2019 said the Prince, settling back upon the divan. Owen had wondered whether his rooms would be furnished Eastern style or Western style. There was, however, no equivalent of the green motor-car. The room was like any other in the wealthier Cairo houses: carpets on the wall, tiles on the floor, low divans, cushions and very little furniture of any other sort. \\u2018Could you tell me first,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018why you were making an expedition to Luxor?\\u2019 \\u2018I was not making an expedition to Luxor. That makes me sound like your English tomb-robbers. I was merely making a boring journey by river and Luxor happened to be at the end of it.\\u2019 \\u2018What, then, was the purpose of your boring journey?\\u2019 The Prince, unexpectedly, was silent for a moment. \\u2018I was accompanying my nephew,\\u2019 he said then. \\u2018The Prince Fahid?\\u2019 \\u2018Exactly.\\u2019 \\u2018And what was the purpose of Prince Fahid's journey?\\u2019 \\u2018To add to his knowledge. He is reaching the age, you see, when he will be expected to play a larger part in public affairs. So we are trying to introduce him to the larger world. He has not even seen yet all the Khedivial estates. There is one not far from Luxor. That is what we went to see.\\u2019 \\u2018You did not stay there very long.\\u2019 \\u2018Quite long enough. Once seen, better quickly forgotten. I believe my father hoped we would stay longer. But Fahid is, like myself, someone on whom the attractions of the desert quickly pall.\\u2019 \\u2018Would it be possible for us to talk to the Prince?\\u2019 \\u2018I thought you might like to see him.\\u2019 Narouz clapped his hands. A servant came in. \\u2018Ask the Prince Fahid to come this way, will you? This, too,\\u2019 he said confidingly to Mahmoud and Owen, \\u2018will add to his experience.\\u2019 A young boy came into the room. He looked inquiringly at Narouz and then came across to the two men, bowed and shook hands. \\u2018More familiar,\\u2019 said Narouz, slightly crossly. \\u2018And Captain Owen is British. Just shake hands.\\u2019 The boy was not in the least off-put. He just stood there smiling easily. He was, Owen judged, about fourteen, a little below medium height and slim, although already showing signs of broadening out like his uncle. His face was delicate, almost girlish, with long eyelashes and large brown eyes. He answered Mahmoud's questions readily enough. They had been to the estate, yes. No, they hadn't stayed long \\u2014 a little amused glance at Narouz here. The journey had been interesting, yes. Quite, that was. He would have preferred a motor-boat. His uncle was going to take him on one when they next went to Cannes. Luxor? Like most Egyptians, he took the past for granted and was not particularly interested in it. The river? Was merely the river. The landscape, familiar since childhood, was not worthy of remark. There was something practical, matter-of-fact about the boy. If the dahabeeyah had had an engine-room Owen could have imagined him poking around happily in it. He was not one for admiring the sunset. The night the girl had disappeared; he remembered it well. A serious look came over his face. They had been about to have dinner. It was an important occasion because his uncle was to have initiated him into the mysteries of handling langoustines. When the girl hadn't come down, his uncle had been angry and sent the eunuch up. They  had started without her. And then, of course, the eunuch had returned. \\u2018You see,\\u2019 said Narouz, after Fahid had shaken hands all round and departed, \\u2018he's very inexperienced. They spend too long in the harem these days.\\u2019 \\u2018He's surely not still \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Of course not. He's been out for some time. He has private tutors. English, French and Italian. But I sometimes think they are just as bad.\\u2019 The harem. Would it be possible to speak with the ladies of the harem, Mahmoud asked diffidently. They had after all been on board. The Prince's face clouded over. \\u2018I don't know about that,\\u2019 he said doubtfully. Then his face cleared. \\u2018Why not?\\u2019 he said enthusiastically. \\u2018It will be something different for them.\\u2019 He summoned the ladies of the harem. They appeared, wrapped like their less exalted sisters from head to foot in black, and ostensibly reluctantly. Over their veils, though, their eyes sparkled. They answered Mahmoud's questions demurely and vacuously. \\u2018Oh, come on!\\u2019 said the Prince crossly, getting bored. \\u2018Speak up!\\u2019 They had been having dinner separately in the harem quarters, as they always did, the night that it happened. No, they hadn't been aware of anything untoward, not until, much later, the eunuch had come down and searched below deck inch by inch from bows to stern. That had been rather exciting and they were prepared to recount it at considerable length until Narouz intervened and told them to shut up. Mahmoud asked them about the girl. The sparkle went out of their eyes, the veils, which had been slipping, came up. They had, alas, hardly spoken to her. \\u2018Which is not surprising,\\u2019 said Narouz, returning after chivvying them out. \\u2018It would hardly be proper for them to  speak to such women. Though it might give them ideas,\\u2019 he added wistfully. \\u2018Would that also be true of Leila?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. The Prince looked at him quickly. \\u2018Why do you ask?\\u2019 \\u2018You said \\u2018such women\\u2019. I wondered if Leila was the same sort of woman as the other two.\\u2019 \\u2018They were foreign, of course.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, and that puzzles me. I can see how they came to be with you. But Leila was not foreign and it is unusual for one of our women to do things like that. I wondered how it came about?\\u2019 \\u2018It is unusual, yes, but not so out of the common. Especially if the Khedive wishes.\\u2019 \\u2018Did the Khedive wish?\\u2019 \\u2018I was thinking of myself.\\u2019 \\u2018But for you to wish, you must have already known her. How did you come across her in the first place?\\u2019 \\u2018In the first place? I hardly remember.\\u2019 \\u2018In the second place, then,\\u2019 said Mahmoud quietly, recognizing that he was being fenced with. \\u2018For you certainly knew her.\\u2019 Again the sharp glance from the Prince. \\u2018She had been about the Court.\\u2019 \\u2018Come!\\u2019 said Mahmoud, a trifle wearily. \\u2018About the Court?\\u2019 \\u2018Not in the strict sense, of course. My father doesn't have that sort of thing. Not in public.\\u2019 \\u2018You met her at the Palace?\\u2019 \\u2018Not exactly at the Palace.\\u2019 \\u2018Where, then?\\u2019 \\u2018About.\\u2019 \\u2018These things are important, Prince.\\u2019 \\u2018Why are they important?\\u2019 \\u2018We need to know her identity.\\u2019 The Prince rubbed his chin. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Yes. I thought you would.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, then?\\u2019 \\u2018This is the embarrassing part. I don't know.\\u2019 \\u2018Come!\\u2019 \\u2018I know you don't believe me but it's true. I don't even know her name. Well, no, that's not true. Her name was Leila. But that is all I know. I do not know her family.\\u2019 \\u2018Are you sure, Prince?\\u2019 \\u2018She did not wish me to know her family. I used to tease her about it. \\u2018Little Miss No-Name from No-Where.\\u2019 She would not say. She was, I think,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018ashamed.\\u2019 \\u2018Where did you meet her?\\u2019 \\u2018At a play. I do not ordinarily go to Egyptian plays. I find them unredeemingly turgid. This one, I was assured, was different. It was by a modern playwright. I went in the belief that I was encouraging a modern renaissance of the Egyptian theatre. I was,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018horribly mistaken. The play was as turgid as ever. And, what was worse, ridiculously radical.\\u2019 \\u2018The girl?\\u2019 \\u2018I met her afterwards, backstage. There was a party. Naturally I had been invited. Foolishly I went, to encourage, as I say, the theatre. It was awful. The one interesting thing was the girl. I met her again afterwards. Several times. And then I thought of inviting her to accompany me on this foolish expedition.\\u2019 \\u2018Could you tell me the name of the play?\\u2019 \\u2018New Roses in the Garden.\\u2019 The Prince shuddered. \\u2018Never again. The avant-garde is not for me. Not in the theatre, anyway.\\u2019 He looked at his watch. \\u2018Perhaps we can continue some other time,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, rising dutifully. \\u2018Of course. Of course.\\u2019 He accompanied them to the door. At the door he hesitated. \\u2018You have not,\\u2019 he said diffidently, \\u2018not yet found the body?\\u2019 \\u2018I am afraid not.\\u2019 \\u2018No? Well, I expect you will.\\u2019 He hesitated again and then suddenly brightened. \\u2018Of course,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018if you don't\\u2026 Well, there ceases to be a problem, doesn't there? No body, no crime.\\u2019 CHAPTER 4 \\u2018No problem?\\u2019 said Zeinab, outraged. \\u2018The girl is dead, isn't she?\\u2019 \\u2018We can't be sure of that,\\u2019 said Owen cautiously. \\u2018No? You think she jumped off the top of that boat and swam to the shore?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, in principle she could have done \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Egyptian girls,\\u2019 said Zeinab haughtily, \\u2018do not swim.\\u2019 Owen was beginning to wish he hadn't told her. \\u2018In any case,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018Narouz is wrong. Just because there isn't a body, that doesn't mean there couldn't be a case. A potential crime has been reported. The report itself is sufficient to trigger things. An investigation has been started and it will continue until, well, the file is closed. It has become a bureaucratic matter now.\\u2019 \\u2018There are times,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018when you sound boringly cold-blooded.\\u2019 \\u2018The investigation will continue,\\u2019 Owen contented himself with saying. \\u2018Oh, good.\\u2019 Zeinab brooded a while. Then she said, \\u2018It will continue, yes, but will it get anywhere?\\u2019 \\u2018We've only just started,\\u2019 said Owen defensively. \\u2018You haven't got very far yet,\\u2019 Zeinab pointed out. \\u2018It's a difficult case.\\u2019 \\u2018That is because you started in the wrong place. With the body, not with Leila.\\u2019 \\u2018We don't know anything about Leila yet.\\u2019 \\u2018That's just what I'm saying. You ought to find out about  her. What sort of girl she was, how she came to do something like this \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Something like what?\\u2019 asked Owen, exasperated. \\u2018It's not what she's done, it's what's been done to her.\\u2019 \\u2018How did she come to be on the dahabeeyah?\\u2019 demanded Zeinab. \\u2018That's not a thing a normal Egyptian girl would have done. Even I wouldn't have done a thing like that!\\u2019 \\u2018We'll try to find out. We arc trying to find out. Only \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018What was the name of that play?\\u2019 demanded Zeinab, disregarding his patter. \\u2018The one Narouz met her at?\\u2019 \\u2018NewRoses in the Garden. Pretty dreadful, too, according to Narouz.\\u2019 \\u2018But I know that play,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018It's Gamal's latest. We received an invitation.\\u2019 \\u2018Did we?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. You didn't go.\\u2019 Owen enjoyed Zeinab's artistic friends. And he liked Gamal, whose acquaintance he had first made when working on one of his earliest cases as Mamur Zapt. At the time Gamal had written a number of plays but none of them had yet actually been produced. Since then several had reached the boards. The audiences, though, had been confined to the especially perceptive. \\u2018It would have been the opening night,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018I couldn't go, so I went to the second night. You couldn't go either. You were down in Minya Province running after that gipsy girl.\\u2019 \\u2018No I wasn't!\\u2019 This was an old charge. Quite unjustified. \\u2018While I was left in Cairo. Alone,\\u2019 said Zeinab, unforgiving. \\u2018This is beside the point.\\u2019 \\u2018No it isn't. Because if you had not been down in Minya chasing that gipsy woman you would have been at the   theatre. And then you would have met Leila. So,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018it's all your fault.\\u2019 Owen was silenced for a moment. Then he recovered. \\u2018So it is. You're right. If I had not been chasing that gipsy woman I could have gone to the party and chased Leila.\\u2019 \\u2018You will not deflect me,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018with your perverse remarks. I intend to find out whether she was there that night and who Leila was.\\u2019 Mahmoud, adopting more orthodox procedures, was also trying to establish Leila's identity. \\u2018So,\\u2019 he was saying to the Prince's chauffeur as Owen arrived, \\u2018you picked the two girls up from the salon and took them to the river at Beni Suef?\\u2019 \\u2018If that's what they say, yes.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not what they say, it's what you say,\\u2019 said Mahmoud sternly. The man shrugged, confident in the power of the Prince to protect, at least against the Parquet. A confidence which Mahmoud had anticipated and which he had invited Owen along to undermine. \\u2018This is the Mamur Zapt,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Be careful how you answer.\\u2019 The man flinched slightly. \\u2018I shall answer as I please,\\u2019 he said, but less boldly. Something of the Mamur Zapt's old aura still clung to the post. To it was added a certain unpredictability these days because of its British incumbency. \\u2018You picked the two girls up?\\u2019 Mahmoud repeated. \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018That is better. And now you are speaking with your own voice. Let us keep it that way. You took them to the river at Beni Suef?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Good. And there you waited till the dahabeeyah came in. At which point you put the women on board. Yes?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018But,\\u2019 pursued Mahmoud, \\u2018there were three women, were there not?\\u2019 \\u2018If you say so.\\u2019 \\u2018I would like to hear you say so. With your own voice.\\u2019 \\u2018Three women, then,\\u2019 said the chauffeur. \\u2018So where did this other woman come from?\\u2019 The man hesitated. \\u2018Tell us the truth,\\u2019 said Owen, speaking for the first time. \\u2018And remember that we may already know it. Remember, too, that we do not have to ask you here. I may take you back to the Bab el Khalk and ask you.\\u2019 \\u2018I picked her up too,\\u2019 said the chauffeur. \\u2018Of course. And where did you pick her up? Not from the salon, was it?\\u2019 \\u2018No. I had picked her up first, before going to the salon. She was waiting for me.\\u2019 \\u2018And waiting for you where?\\u2019 \\u2018I was to pick her up by the Souk Al-Gadira.\\u2019 \\u2018By the Souk Al-Gadira? Did you not pick her up from a house?\\u2019 \\u2018No, effendi \\u2014\\u2019 the chauffeur was being polite now \\u2014\\u2018the souk there is where four roads meet. The streets are narrow and twist and turn and it is not advisable to take a car up them. Not a car like this one.\\u2019 There was a note of reverence in the chauffeur's voice. All the time he talked he kept his hand on the bonnet, partly for reassurance \\u2014 he was less confident than he seemed \\u2014 and partly as a caress. \\u2018So where did you meet?\\u2019 \\u2018At the junction of the Sharia el Garb with the Sharia el Hakim. I was told she would be waiting for me.\\u2019 \\u2018Who told you?\\u2019 The chauffeur looked very unhappy. \\u2018Effendi,\\u2019 he whispered, \\u2018I \\u2014 I do not think I should say.\\u2019 The Prince, then. \\u2018Had you been to the spot before?\\u2019 Eventually they brought him to admit that he had either collected the girl from or returned the girl to the spot on several occasions over the last two months. \\u2018And did you ever go with the girl to her house? Think before you speak.\\u2019 Never. The chauffeur swore on the Book. He had always delivered her to the same spot. Always. He had stayed in the car. She had never asked him to accompany her home. He would have been reluctant to accede if she had. Who knew what might befall the car if left unattended? \\u2018Effendi,\\u2019 said the chauffeur earnestly, \\u2018there are bad men abroad.\\u2019 Worse; there were small boys. It was clear that, for the chauffeur at least, cars had priority over women. The chauffeur, then, had no idea where the girl lived? He had not. He was prepared to swear it on the Book. Nevertheless, Owen thought he might be speaking the truth. Mahmoud tried one last way. Had the chauffeur ever picked up the Prince from the neighbourhood? Or delivered him to a house in that vicinity? He stopped the chauffeur wearily before he got to the Book. Owen went down to the souk himself. The man he was looking for, a Greek, was sitting at a table outside a cafe, deep in conversation with three Arabs. From time to time, almost absent-mindedly, he reached into his pocket and produced a sweet, which he gave to any small boy who happened to be near. There were, naturally, quite a lot of small boys near. The Greek was deep in a dramatic tale of misadventure. \\u2018And then, by God, it pulled out to miss a donkey and I looked, lo, and it was coming straight towards me! I threw myself against the wall and prayed. And God must have heard my prayers, for it passed by me leaving me unharmed.\\u2019 \\u2018God is great!\\u2019 said the rapt audience. \\u2018Unharmed,\\u2019 said the Greek, \\u2018but not untouched. For as  it passed, it reached out and caught my sleeve and rent it. And I stumbled and would have fallen had it not been for the wall.\\u2019 \\u2018God is indeed merciful!\\u2019 \\u2018He is indeed!\\u2019 agreed the Greek. \\u2018Such things ought not to be,\\u2019 said one of his hearers. \\u2018That is true. And do you know what I believe to be at the root of the problem?\\u2019 His listeners shook their heads. \\u2018Speed,\\u2019 declared the Greek. \\u2018That's what it is. People are trying to go too fast.\\u2019 \\u2018True. Oh, very true.\\u2019 \\u2018It is the curse of the age.\\u2019 \\u2018What is wrong with donkeys?\\u2019 asked one of the men. \\u2018That's what I say. God put man in the world. He put donkeys in the world. But he did not put cars!\\u2019 \\u2018That is true,\\u2019 said his hearers, impressed. They volunteered their own embroiderings of the theme. The Greek could not, however, put the incident out of his mind. \\u2018It was a mighty car,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018and painted green.\\u2019 \\u2018Green?\\u2019 said one of the small boys, all of whom had been following the conversation as closely as the men. \\u2018Yes. And that is not right, either. For green is the colour of the Prophet and \\u2014\\u2019 The small boy, however, was not interested. \\u2018I have seen a green car,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018ft comes down here.\\u2019 \\u2018What sort of car?\\u2019 The boy described it. \\u2018The very car!\\u2019 declared the Greek. He slipped the boy two large boiled sweets and turned to his friends across the table. \\u2018Be warned!\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Lest you, too, be crushed and defiled! Guard your footsteps! Look over your shoulder!\\u2019 Etcetera, etcetera. His hearers enjoyed every minute of it. Cairenes liked a good alarm. The Greek, satisfied with the effect of his story, rose from  his seat, shook hands all round and prepared to depart. At the last moment he caught sight of Owen, who had taken up position at an adjoining table, and raised hands to heaven. \\u2018My friend!\\u2019 he declared. \\u2018And I had not seen you!\\u2019 Owen rose to greet him and they embraced like long-lost brothers. The Greek was persuaded \\u2014 needed no persuasion, really \\u2014 to sit down. More coffee was called for. The Greek's friends at his previous table watched benignly; and the phalanx of small boys switched support. The Greek continued to feed them with sweets. And then, after he and Owen had been talking for some while, he crooked his finger and called over the boy who had seen \\u2018My friend has an interest in our car,\\u2019 he said. The small boy swelled with the pride of implied shared possession. \\u2018It is a good car,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Sadly, though \\u2014 and this is the way of the world as you will find out when you grow up \\u2014 my friend is less interested in the car itself than in some of the people it carries. One in particular.\\u2019 He winked at the boy. \\u2018Did not the car, when it stopped here, pick up a fine young woman?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know about fine,\\u2019 said the boy. \\u2018It picked up Leila.\\u2019 \\u2018There!\\u2019 said the Greek to Owen. \\u2018I knew it! And he even knows her name!\\u2019 \\u2018Leila Sekhmet,\\u2019 said the boy. \\u2018And she lives near here?\\u2019 \\u2018Just up the street.\\u2019 \\u2018Show me the house,\\u2019 said the Greek, \\u2018and if it should happen that on the way we meet a sweet-seller\\u2026\\u2019 It did so happen. The Greek purchased a bag of sweets, well, not so much a bag as a twist of newspaper, distributed some of the sweets among his retinue of small boys and gave the rest to his guide. \\u2018It may be that future conversation could benefit us both,\\u2019 he said. The boy led them up one of the dark streets to a place  where the houses were tall and thin and so closely packed together that door followed immediately upon door. He stopped outside one of these. \\u2018Leila lives here?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Who does the house belong to?\\u2019 \\u2018Mrs Rabaq.\\u2019 \\u2018And who is Mrs Rabaq?\\u2019 \\u2018Leila's aunt.\\u2019 The Greek knocked on the door. After some moments it was opened by an elderly woman servant. \\u2018Please announce me to Mrs Rabaq,\\u2019 said the Greek. \\u2018Tell her we come about Leila.\\u2019 The woman stood still. \\u2018Who are you?\\u2019 she said. \\u2018This is the Mamur Zapt,\\u2019 said the Greek, indicating Owen. The woman's eyes swept over him. \\u2018I shall not tell her that,\\u2019 she said. She stumped away. They heard her steps going up the stairs. It was a while before they returned. \\u2018She will see you.\\u2019 The woman hesitated. \\u2018She is very old,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018and no longer understands things clearly. But she will see you.\\u2019 The room was closely shuttered and very dark. The only light was from a dim kerosene lamp standing on a low table. There was a sofa in the middle of the room on which an old woman was sitting. She had pulled her veil right over her face so that they could not even see her eyes. \\u2018Leila is my niece,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018What has happened to her?\\u2019 She had spoken in Arabic and Owen replied in Arabic. He fell naturally into the courteous, familiar mode used to address the elderly. \\u2018We do not know that anything has happened to her, mother,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018But we fear.\\u2019 \\u2018I fear too,\\u2019 said the woman. \\u2018I always fear.\\u2019 \\u2018We fear that an accident may have befallen her.\\u2019 The woman drew her breath in sharply. Then she stood up. \\u2018I will go to her. Tell me where she is. I will go \\u2014\\u2019 She swayed and put out her hand. Owen caught her and eased her gently back on to the sofa. \\u2018When the time comes, mother,\\u2019 he said soothingly. \\u2018If it comes. But it has not come yet. At the moment it is just that she is missing.\\u2019 \\u2018She is always missing,\\u2019 said the old woman querulously. \\u2018It is not right. She comes and goes as she pleases. My sister's daughter. We were never like that. Our father would never have allowed \\u2014\\u2019 She put her hand to her head. \\u2018Leila!\\u2019 she said and burst into tears. The servant, who had followed them into the room, put her arms round her and comforted her. \\u2018It is time you went to bed,\\u2019 she said. She helped the old woman up and led her across the room. At the door the old woman shook herself free. \\u2018Wait!\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Who are these men, Khadija? Why are they here?\\u2019 \\u2018It is nothing, mother,\\u2019 said the servant. \\u2018Come!\\u2019 She led her out through the door. \\u2018Do not go,\\u2019 she said over her shoulder to Owen and the Greek. \\u2018I will come down shortly.\\u2019 They waited quietly. The furniture was old, the furnishings sparse. They heard the servant returning. She went on past the door of the room. When she came back it was with a tray, coffee-cups and sugar. \\u2018Be seated.\\u2019 She came back again, this time with a brazier and coffee-pot. She stirred the ashes and placed the coffee-pot in the middle. \\u2018That is proper,\\u2019 she said with satisfaction. \\u2018That is the way it used to be.\\u2019 She poured them some coffee. \\u2018So,\\u2019 she said to Owen, \\u2018you're the Mamur Zapt, are you?\\u2019 \\u2018That is so, mother.\\u2019 He addressed her in the same way as he had her mistress, with the deference due to age. \\u2018What has she done wrong?\\u2019 \\u2018Leila? I do not know that she has done anything wrong. Except, perhaps, that she has stayed out too late at night.\\u2019 \\u2018She has certainly done that. But does the Mamur Zapt interest himself in things like that?\\u2019 \\u2018I think she is dead. And the Mamur Zapt does interest himself in things like that.\\u2019 The woman had not bothered to pull her veil across her face. She stared at Owen with large, unblinking eyes. \\u2018How did she die?\\u2019 \\u2018I think she may have drowned.\\u2019 \\u2018Drowned? How could she have drowned?\\u2019 \\u2018She was on the river. In a dahabeeyah.\\u2019 \\u2018I do not understand. How could she have been on the river? In a dahabeeyah?\\u2019 \\u2018Did you know nothing of it?\\u2019 \\u2018Nothing.\\u2019 \\u2018Nor who she was with?\\u2019 The woman gave a little hard laugh. \\u2018It is that, is it? No,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018no. No, she never told me. And I thought it best not to ask.\\u2019 \\u2018You did not approve?\\u2019 \\u2018How could I ? It was wrong to leave her family in the first place, wrong, having come here to go on leading the life she did.\\u2019 \\u2018What sort of life was that?\\u2019 \\u2018When she was a child she was a pretty little thing. Her father doted on her. We all did. 1, her mother. The only child, although a girl child. Her father took her with us when we went to France. And that was a big mistake, for there she saw and was seen.\\u2019 Among the men she was seen by was a young man from  another rich Alexandrian family and when they all returned to Egypt he somehow succeeded in gaining access to her. \\u2018He said to her: \\u2018Let us be free, as the young in France are free.\\u2019 And she was thrilled by that, for she found it hard to come back to a woman's life in Egypt after tasting life in France. Before, she knew no better. Now, she wanted holiday all the time.\\u2019 The young man's intentions had been honourable and he had asked his father to obtain her as a bride. His father, however, had had other ideas. Perhaps Leila's family had not been quite good enough for him. Perhaps it was just that he had already made other plans. Marriages in middle-class Egyptian families were made by the father, usually without reference to the son or daughter, and sometimes without even reference to the mother. Anyway, the boy's 6ther had refused. Leila's father had somehow got to hear of it and in her case, of course, the consequences were worse. Her father, lax before, now kept her immured. She was not even allowed to receive female visitors. Leila had both pined and rebelled. Somehow she again made contact with the young man. And one night they had eloped. \\u2018What happened next I do not know,\\u2019 said the servant, \\u2018but a year later she came to our house here and threw herself into the mistress's arms and begged her to take her in. Of course she said yes. Leila was her sister's child. Besides, she had none of her own and Leila had always been a favourite. And I thought at first that it was good, because my mistress had lost her interest in life and I thought this might renew it.\\u2019 She lifted the pot, stirred the ashes and then replaced it. The action seemed to break her train of thought, for afterwards she did not resume speaking, seemed to forget she had been speaking and sat waiting passively. Owen realized suddenly that like her mistress she was old. \\u2018You thought that at first,\\u2019 he prompted gently, \\u2018but afterwards you changed your mind?\\u2019 She came back with a start. \\u2018Not at first. She was so glad to be with us and we were so glad to have her. The mistress fussed over her \\u2014 still does \\u2014 and they were like mother and daughter. And Leila needed a mother. But then \\u2014\\u2019 She broke off. \\u2018Then?\\u2019 Owen prompted softly. \\u2018The mistress became \\u2014 as she is now. Leila nursed her tenderly. But as the months went by she became restless. She was a young woman now and needed more. She needed a man. She started to go out.\\u2019 \\u2018She had friends?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. Some she had met \\u2014 when she was with him. I do not know what sort of friends they were that they would let a young woman come to them on her own! But soon she was always with them.\\u2019 \\u2018Nights?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said the woman. \\u2018Well, once or twice, perhaps. She said she had been to the theatre and that afterwards they had talked late. I did not press. I did not want to know. The theatre!\\u2019 She shuddered. \\u2018What sort of place is that for a woman to go to? If that was the sort of friends they were \\u2014!\\u2019 \\u2018Did she tell you any of their names?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 Owen thought. \\u2018I would like to see her room. Perhaps she kept names, addresses.\\u2019 The woman hesitated uncertainly. \\u2018Are you married?\\u2019 she asked suddenly. \\u2018Me? No.\\u2019 \\u2018It would not be proper.\\u2019 \\u2018How about him?\\u2019 said Owen, indicating the Greek. \\u2018He is married.\\u2019 The woman surveyed the Greek closely. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018I can see that. How many wives have you got?\\u2019 she asked with interest. \\u2018One,\\u2019 said the Greek. \\u2018That is more than enough.\\u2019 The woman cackled. \\u2018She keeps you on a tight rein, does she? That is proper,\\u2019 she said approvingly. \\u2018Very well,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018I will show you her room.\\u2019 Owen, alone in the room, poured himself some more coffee. There was an old shira carpet on the wall, very faded, an old, full-length, incredibly elaborate mirror, some old pots, Persian boxes. No money in the house now, he thought, but money in the past. He wondered about Leila's family. Georgiades came back shaking his head. Owen stood up. \\u2018Thank you,\\u2019 he said to the old servant woman. \\u2018You have been very helpful. There is just one thing more: I feel I should tell Leila's parents. Can you give me their names and tell me where I might find them?\\u2019 The woman stood very still. \\u2018She is dead to them already,\\u2019 she said bitterly. \\u2018Why do you bring a dead body back from the grave?\\u2019 Since he was in the area, Owen decided he would go down to the river and take another look at the shoal on which Leila's body had come to rest. His way took him past the local police station. Sitting on the ground in front of it were the two constables who had delayed him at the dovecot during the arms search. They greeted him cheerfully. \\u2018Hello,\\u2019 they said. \\u2018Any nearer finding that body?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018I'm nearer.\\u2019 \\u2018Good. Tell us when you find it.\\u2019 \\u2018Don't worry,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018I will.\\u2019 He would, too, he promised himself. He was sure they knew something, some trick that that idle, rascally District Chief had been up to. There had been something they'd said. What was it? And then he stopped in his tracks, turned and made his way in a quite different direction. He found the watchman asleep under a tree, his legs curled up under him as they had been when he had pantomimed the way he had found the body, his turban neatly parked beside him. Owen stirred him gently with his foot. The man's eyes opened. \\u2018Effendi!\\u2019 he said in alarm, scrambling to his feet. \\u2018I am sorry to disturb you, Abu,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018but there are things I would know.\\u2019 \\u2018I will help you if I can,\\u2019 the man said doubtfully, \\u2018but I have told you all I know.\\u2019 \\u2018Not quite all. Let us go back to the moment you found the body, the moment you realized that it was a body. What did you do?\\u2019 \\u2018I went to the Chief to report it.\\u2019 \\u2018This was at the police station, was it?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018Was he alone?\\u2019 \\u2018No, effendi. Fazal was with him. Fazal had just come in and they were talking. They were talking \\u2014\\u2019 Abu lowered his eyes bashfully \\u2014\\u2018about you, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018About me?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi. Fazal said that you had met up with the men and had started work. And the Chief said: \\u2018Already? Before God, they must have little work to do.\\u2019 That is what he said, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018Did he?\\u2019 said Owen grimly. \\u2018It is all the same with these great people \\u2014 this is what he said, effendi. They have nothing better to do than go down and make a nuisance of themselves to people who are peacefully going about their own affairs. That is what he said.\\u2019 \\u2018Really?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. And then he turned on me and shouted: \\u2018And here is another! What have you brought me to spoil my day, Abu?\\u2019 And I told him, and he said: \\u2018What do I care about  bodies? Let it lie there.\\u2019 And Fazal said: \\u2018You had better not do that if the Mamur Zapt is about.\\u2019 And the Chief said: \\u2018That is true, Fazal.\\u2019 And he thought, and then he said: \\u2018I know what we will do, Fazal. You go and tell the Mamur Zapt that there is urgent business at the river. Let him see to it.\\u2019 And then he laughed and said: \\u2018This is the way to do it, Fazal. Let us get the great working for us for a change.\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018Thank you,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Very interesting.\\u2019 \\u2018That was good, wasn't it, effendi?\\u2019 said Abu happily. \\u2018To have you working for him and not the other way round.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, very good. So Fazal went off to fetch me. And then what?\\u2019 \\u2018Then the Chief picked up the phone and said to me: \\u2018And while we are at it, let us get those other idle bastards off their backsides.\\u2019 Pardon, effendi, that is what he said.\\u2019 \\u2018Go on. Who did he phone?\\u2019 \\u2018The Parquet, I think. And one other. And then he said to me: \\u2018Push off, Abu! Get back to the river lest the Mamur Zapt come and find no one there.\\u2019 So I went.\\u2019 \\u2018What about Ibrahim? Was he sent with you?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi. The Chief put his head out of the office and called for him and said: \\u2018Go with Abu. There is a body. You know what to do.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Ibrahim, \\u2018I know what to do.\\u2019 And so we went together.\\u2019 \\u2018That,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018is most interesting.\\u2019 \\u2018Is it, effendi?\\u2019 said Abu, greatly gratified. \\u2018Yes. But still puzzling. Tell me, Abu: you went to the river together?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018That is what I find puzzling. Are you sure?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018All the way? Together?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi. Well, Ibrahim asked me to call in at Mohammed Fingari's to get a package for him. And that was strange because Mohammed said: \\u2018What package is this?\\u2019 And I said \\u2014'  \\u2018OK, OK,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018I get the idea. You went in to get the package while Ibrahim went on to the river \\u2014 was that it?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018So you joined him there?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi. And he chided me, saying: \\u2018Where have you been, Abu? What if the Mamur Zapt had come in your absence?\\u2019 And I said: \\u2018It is not my fault, Ibrahim. You \\u2014\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018Thank you. Thank you. I understand. So in fact Ibrahim arrived at the river first?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018Alone?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi. Until I got there. Which wasn't long, effendi, really. I swear it. It was just that \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Thank you. You have told me what I wished to know.\\u2019 \\u2018I have?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. And now we will go to the Chief.\\u2019 Abu fell in beside him. He was clearly, however, turning things over in his mind. \\u2018Effendi,\\u2019 he said diffidently. \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 \\u2018If I have said anything untoward, the Chief will beat me.\\u2019 \\u2018If what you have told me is true, it will be the Chief who is beaten.\\u2019 \\u2018So tell me, Ibrahim, what happened when you and Abu went down to the river?\\u2019 The constable scratched his head. \\u2018What happened? Nothing happened. When we got there, the body wasn't there. If it ever had been there.\\u2019 \\u2018You went to the river together?\\u2019 \\u2018Indeed.\\u2019 \\u2018All the way \\u2014 together?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. More or less.\\u2019 \\u2018You did not go on ahead?\\u2019 \\u2018No, effendi. Well, if I did, that was because Abu took so long. Yes, I remember, effendi.\\u2019 He turned to Owen, \\u2018I waited, but that foolish fellow took so long \\u2014 having a cup of tea, no doubt\\u2014 that I was worried lest you come and find the corpse unattended, so I hurried on.\\u2019 \\u2018Alone?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, yes, alone.\\u2019 \\u2018And what did you do when you came to the river?\\u2019 \\u2018To the river? Nothing. I waited for Abu. It was but a minute, effendi. And then you came.\\u2019 \\u2018You weren't there long?\\u2019 \\u2018No, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018But long enough to fetch the pole?\\u2019 Ibrahim's jaw dropped. \\u2018Pole?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018That's what you use, isn't it? To push the bodies off? So that they float down to the next district and you don't have to report them?\\u2019 The Chief had gone pale. \\u2018That is correct, isn't it?\\u2019 Owen addressed him. \\u2018That is the usual practice, is it not?\\u2019 The Chief found it hard to speak. \\u2018Sometimes,\\u2019 he said at last. \\u2018Only this time it was a mistake. For you had already summoned me. And notified the Parquet. You did not mean it to happen this time. Only Ibrahim misunderstood you. \\u2018You know what to do,\\u2019 you said to him. And he thought he knew what that meant.\\u2019 The corporal shot the Chief an agonized glance. \\u2018So he got rid of Abu and hurried on ahead. And when he got to the river he took the pole \\u2014 and he pushed the body off! \\u2018Effendi \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018That is what happened, didn't it?\\u2019 \\u2018Effendi \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018This time,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018you had better speak the truth.\\u2019 \\u2018Effendi,\\u2019 said Ibrahim desperately, \\u2018that is what would have happened if \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 \\u2018If the body had been there!\\u2019 CHAPTER 5 \\u2018What?\\u2019 Mahmoud sprang out of his chair. \\u2018Sit down, sit down,\\u2019 said Owen hurriedly, looking around him at the crowded cafe. The clientele, however, used to the drama of Arab conversation, went on placidly reading their newspapers. \\u2018What did you say?\\u2019 \\u2018They pushed them off. So that they floated down to the next district and they wouldn't have to bother.\\u2019 \\u2018Pushed them off?\\u2019 Mahmoud could hardly believe his ears, refused to believe his ears. \\u2018Yes. There was a special pole they used. That was what gave me the due. The constables mentioned a pole.\\u2019 \\u2018But this, this is \\u2014\\u2019 Mahmoud, incoherent with fury, could not for the moment say what it was. \\u2018Outrageous!\\u2019 he shouted. \\u2018Yes, yes. Come on, sit down,\\u2019 said Owen, plucking at his arm. Mahmoud shook him off. \\u2018Disgraceful!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, yes. I know. Come on \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018I'll have their blood!\\u2019 stormed Mahmoud. \\u2018I'll have their blood for this!\\u2019 He smashed his fist down on the table. This did attract the attention of some of the newspaper readers. It even attracted the attention of the waiter, which  was much more difficult. He came across and dabbed up the spilt coffee with a dirty dishcloth and a flourish. \\u2018By all means,\\u2019 said Owen soothingly. \\u2018Have their blood. But have some coffee first.\\u2019 He coaxed Mahmoud back into his chair. \\u2018It is tampering with the evidence!\\u2019 shouted Mahmoud. \\u2018Yes, yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Evidence is what the whole system is based on. If we cannot trust that, where are we?\\u2019 \\u2018Fortunately we found out.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 Mahmoud quietened down and raised a fresh cup of coffee to his lips. Suddenly he crashed it down again. \\u2018In this one case!\\u2019 he shouted. He sprang to his feet. \\u2018What about the others? The ones we have not found out? You said there were others. The pole! There was a special pole they used for the purpose. That was what you said. There must be others!\\u2019 \\u2018The bodies will have turned up lower down. Come on, sit down. They'll have been reported, they'll be in the system. All we have to do is to check back. Sit down!\\u2019 Mahmoud reluctantly allowed himself to be pulled down. \\u2018It's the principle of the thing,\\u2019 he said to Owen. \\u2018It's the principle.\\u2019 For Mahmoud it was. He had a vision of the legal system as the expression of a clear, abstract principle of justice and believed that practice should correspond. Unfortunately, this being Egypt, the relation of the operating parts of the system to the ideal vision was somewhat cloudy. This was a perpetual source of vexation to Mahmoud and his efforts to do something about it drove him towards reform at the political level \\u2014 he was a member of the Nationalist Party \\u2014 and perfectionism in his daily work. He identified so strongly with the system at its most ideal that when practice fell short, as it invariably did, he took it personally. When the servants of justice revealed short  comings, as in this case of the local Chief and his constable, he felt it almost as personal betrayal. \\u2018This kind of thing makes a mockery of the whole system,\\u2019 he said bitterly. \\u2018It's just a pair of lazy sods,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018To you, perhaps. To me, they are part of the system. And when part of the system fails, the system as a whole fails.\\u2019 He brooded over his coffee. \\u2018It doesn't matter to you much, does it?\\u2019 he suddenly shot at Owen. \\u2018Not much,\\u2019 Owen admitted. \\u2018Why is that? Is it because you don't expect any better of Egyptians anyway?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 The conversation had suddenly moved, as conversation between British and Egyptians often did, into a minefield. \\u2018No,\\u2019 Owen said carefully, very carefully. \\u2018It's just that I don't think in terms of system as much as you do.\\u2019 Mahmoud looked at him intently and then suddenly relaxed. \\u2018I know what it is,\\u2019 he said, smiling. \\u2018It is that you are British. No \\u2014\\u2019 he quickly laid his hand on Owen's arm in the Arab way \\u2014\\u2018I did not mean it like that. I meant that you British are always pragmatic. Whereas I \\u2014\\u2019 he sighed theatrically and smote himself on the chest \\u2014\\u2018am Arab.\\u2019 \\u2018French.\\u2019 Mahmoud looked startled. \\u2018French?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018In this case. The emphasis on system is French, not Arab. You are a true Parquet lawyer, my friend.\\u2019 \\u2018Not Arab? Ah well, it is very confusing being an Egyptian.\\u2019 They both laughed and then sat sipping their coffee equably. Owen had, however, the sense of relief that follows a near miss. It was often like that in conversation with educated Egyptians. Partly it was normal Arab volatility, their ability to  move from elation to depression, rage to calm, in the space of a few bewildering seconds. Partly, though, it was the explosive potential inherent in any true conversation between a representative of a dominating power and one of the dominated. \\u2018Being in Egypt,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018not just being an Egyptian.\\u2019 Mahmoud, however, had already forgotten what had passed and was thinking about something else. \\u2018Ibrahim went there expecting to find the body, didn't he? That was where bodies came ashore. They even kept a pole there ready. He didn't expect it to be washed off again, either. That's not what happened. Once a body had grounded, you had to push it off. If there was any chance of it floating away again of its own accord, he wouldn't have bothered.\\u2019 \\u2018So?\\u2019 \\u2018So it wasn't washed away. And he didn't push it off. So \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 \\u2018Either somebody else did, which isn't likely, because what would be their motive? Ibrahim and the Chief had a motive all right, they wanted to get out of work. But anyone else?\\u2019 \\u2018Or?\\u2019 \\u2018Or somebody found it and took it away.\\u2019 \\u2018Who would want to do a thing like that?\\u2019 \\u2018I think I know,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. Mahmoud took Owen to a part of the city he had never been to before. It was tucked into a corner of Bulak and must have been near the river, for once Owen caught a glimpse of ship masts at the end of a  street . But then streets disappeared altogether and there was just a mass of houses running into one another with the occasional alleyway between them. The alleyways were scored with deep trenches down which the water ran when it rained; or would have run had  its passage not been blocked by heaps of refuse, dung and animal guts, behind which the water collected in stagnant pools, above which mosquitoes hung in a cloud. Mahmoud came to one of these alleyways and hesitated. Looking down it, Owen saw kite hawks picking at the carcase of a dog. Kites were Cairo's scavengers and kept the city clean. Owen normally took them for granted. Today, however, they seemed disturbing. Mahmoud saw something further on and touched Owen's arm. In the shadow between the houses Owen could not see what it was but when they came up to it he saw that it was a man. He was sitting against a wall with his legs tucked up under him. There was something odd about them. Perhaps he had no legs. He seemed asleep. Mahmoud put his hand down and shook him. The man came awake with a start and put his hand up to his face. Owen had taken him for a Sudani because his face was black. As he raised his hand it seemed as if the whole front of his face came off. The blackness was a solid layer of flies. Beneath, the face was one raw wound. \\u2018Which way?\\u2019 said Mahmoud. The man pointed to a kind of buttress beside him. Behind it was a long, thin alleyway. It was so narrow that as they went down it Owen's shoulders brushed the walls on each side. There was a trench running down this one, too, its contents so foul that he walked with his feet astride it. There was the soft scuttle of rats. The alleyway opened out into a space between four houses. The houses were linked together with heavy fretwork windows so that you could not see the sky. Although it was midday everything was pitch dark. In the shadows something moved. It looked like a dog. Owen thought of rabies and reached for his gun. Mahmoud sensed the movement and put out a restraining hand. As Owen's eyes became accustomed to the dark he could  see the dog more clearly. It wasn't a dog, it was more \\u2014 he felt prickles on the back of his neck \\u2014 like a hyena. Its head was down and its back sloped up into a kind of point at the rear. Mahmoud spoke to it. \\u2018Tell him that I have come,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018And that I bring a friend.\\u2019 \\u2018Who is your friend?\\u2019 asked a hoarse voice from the shadows. \\u2018The Mamur Zapt.\\u2019 There was a long silence. \\u2018I will tell him.\\u2019 The creature ran off on all fours. \\u2018What the hell is this?\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Beggars. If they're not crippled to start with, they cripple themselves.\\u2019 The creature came scuttling back. Owen could see now that it was a man. His back was horribly deformed and rose into a kind of hump at the base of the spine. His arms had been amputated at the elbow and his legs at the knees. \\u2018Follow me,\\u2019 it said. They went down an alleyway and in at a door. The room was dark but it was as if there was something fluttering in it. They went through it and on into another room where there was more daylight. Mahmoud gave a cry of disgust and began to beat at his legs. He was black from shoes to waist. Owen looked down at himself. He was black, too, as if coated with a layer of paint. And then he saw that the blackness was moving, and struck at it frantically. He was covered with fleas. There was a hoarse cackle of laughter. Mahmoud strode across and kicked their guide heavily in the ribs. \\u2018There was no need for this!\\u2019 he said angrily. The creature gave a gasp and slipped nimbly out of the way. \\u2018You wanted to see the Man, didn't you?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Where is he?\\u2019 The creature pointed to a dark opening in the wall. Mahmoud went across and then beckoned Owen over. They were looking down into a long dark cellar, lit by a brazier at one end. All round the room men were lying. In the middle of the room a small circle of men were passing something round. The air was heavy with the sweet smell of hashish. \\u2018Who have we here?\\u2019 said a deep voice. \\u2018Greetings, Mustapha el-Gharbi,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. He stepped down into the cellar. The circle opened and made space for them. Owen saw now what they were passing. It was the heavy coconut shell of the goza, or water pipe, which was the way Cairo habitu\\u00e9 preferred to take their hashish. He saw the charcoal glowing. \\u2018Well, Mahmoud el Zaki,\\u2019 said the deep voice. \\u2018It is a long time since we saw you here.\\u2019 Owen was able to pick out the speaker. It was a short, immensely fat man sitting opposite. \\u2018It is a long time since my duties have called me here,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018That is because these days you are at the top of the ladder and it is other men who are sent to places like this.\\u2019 \\u2018It is good for young men to come to places like this when they start,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Then they know what they are up against.\\u2019 The man opposite chuckled. \\u2018Still the same Mahmoud el Zaki,\\u2019 he said drily. \\u2018Unbending as ever. Nevertheless, he has come here, so he must seek a favours \\u2018Not necessarily a favour. A deal, rather.\\u2019 \\u2018That's more like it. And,\\u2019 said the man, glancing at Owen, \\u2018you have brought a friend with you with whom indeed we might be able to do business.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think so. This is the Mamur Zapt.\\u2019 \\u2018I know.\\u2019 \\u2018Greetings, Mustapha el-Gharbi,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018And to you greetings. It is a pleasure to have the Mamur Zapt with us again.\\u2019 \\u2018Again?\\u2019 \\u2018I used to do business with one of your predecessors.\\u2019 Which one was that, wondered Owen? The one who was dismissed for corruption? He felt Mahmoud stiffen beside him. \\u2018It is always good to do business with friends,\\u2019 he said diplomatically. \\u2018That is so. And doubly good where pleasure and benefit coincide.\\u2019 \\u2018Let us hope that is the case today. I am in the market for information.\\u2019 \\u2018Is that so?\\u2019 El-Gharbi stroked his beard. \\u2018What sort of information?\\u2019 \\u2018About a body that may have come ashore,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018What makes you think I might possess that kind of information?\\u2019 \\u2018Your people work the river banks. They are like ants or beetles. They work all day. And they do not miss much.\\u2019 \\u2018They are good workers,\\u2019 said El-Gharbi, with the air of one making a concession. \\u2018The body we are interested in came ashore in the Al-Gadira district four nights ago. It fetched up on a sandbank. The watchman went to tell the local Chief and when he came back the body was gone.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, well,\\u2019 said El-Gharbi. \\u2018How puzzling for him.\\u2019 \\u2018It puzzled me, too,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018For your people do not usually take the body. They strip it and leave it.\\u2019 \\u2018Bodies in themselves are usually worth nothing,\\u2019 said El-Gharbi. \\u2018This one is worth something.\\u2019 \\u2018How much?\\u2019 \\u2018That is what we have to determine.\\u2019 \\u2018Tell me about this body.\\u2019 \\u2018It is the body of a young girl. She was wearing pink shintiyan.\\u2019 \\u2018Not a peasant woman, then. But then again, if she had been, you would not have been coming to see me. How did she come to be in the water?\\u2019 \\u2018We do not know. She was on a boat.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah yes,\\u2019 said El-Gharbi. \\u2018Four nights ago? That would have been the Prince's dahabeeyah. Well, of course, that does put the price up.\\u2019 \\u2018You have information, then, that might interest us?\\u2019 \\u2018I might. It is not straightforward, though.\\u2019 \\u2018Would you be prepared to sell?\\u2019 \\u2018I might. The circumstances are, however, complex. And the price would have to be right. The market is, shall I say, a live one.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you think would be the going price in such a market?\\u2019 \\u2018I would say that five thousand pounds, Egyptian, would attract interest.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018I feel that the largeness of spirit for which you are famous has expressed itself in the figure you give us.\\u2019 \\u2018On the contrary. The affection I feel for you personally has led me, if anything, to understate it. The market is, as I have said, a live one.\\u2019 As the negotiations proceeded, Owen became more and more convinced that this was so. El-Gharbi seemed to feel under no pressure at all to reduce his asking figure, and Owen felt that this was not just a matter of negotiating tactics. He seemed to be sure he would make his price. The price was, however, out of Owen's reach. He had at his discretion a sum \\u2014 a considerable sum, in the view of the Accounts Department \\u2014 which could be used for the payment of informers. A sum like this, though, would eat such a hole in it as to jeopardize his ordinary work. El-Gharbi was watching his face. \\u2018Of course,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018if you were able to offer me something else \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Something else?\\u2019 Owen, puzzled. \\u2018What could that be?\\u2019 \\u2018Information. Like you, I am always in the market for information. And I, too, would pay a good price.\\u2019 \\u2018What sort of information?\\u2019 \\u2018When wealth travels by river. Which boat. When it departs. Where it is going to.\\u2019 Owen shook his head. \\u2018Alas,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I do not sell that kind of information.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas,\\u2019 El-Gharbi commiserated, \\u2018then it may be difficult for you to find the price my information commands in the market.\\u2019 \\u2018There is always,\\u2019 said El-Gharbi after a while, \\u2018another possibility open to you. You yourself may not be able to raise the money. But perhaps you have friends who could-if it was important to them.\\u2019 Owen's mind had begun to work on the same lines. \\u2018My friends are, I am afraid, like myself, poor. But perhaps I should talk to them.\\u2019 \\u2018Why not?\\u2019 said El-Gharbi, smiling pleasantly. \\u2018I am sure your friends will be eager to help \\u2014 once you explain to them what the money is for. Why not consult them? Only do not leave it too long. The market is, as I say, live. As opposed, of course, to the girl.\\u2019 \\u2018Five thousand pounds!\\u2019 said the Prince, aghast. \\u2018That seems a lot of money.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. That's what I thought, too.\\u2019 \\u2018It must be just a bargaining price. An opening offer. Pouf, man, you've let yourself be scared by a figure plucked out of the clouds. Go back and offer him five hundred.\\u2019 \\u2018I have. And he wasn't interested.\\u2019 \\u2018He pretended not to be interested, I dare say. But five hundred \\u2014 well, that's a lot of money, too. For these people.\\u2019 \\u2018He just laughed.\\u2019 \\u2018A negotiating tactic. I am afraid you're not used to the  ways of the bazaar, Captain Owen. You've let yourself be out negotiated.\\u2019 \\u2018I got the impression that the price was not negotiable.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, come! Any price is negotiable. It's just that you don't know how we do it here, Captain Owen. An Englishman \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Mr el Zaki was with me.\\u2019 The Prince looked at Mahmoud. \\u2018Was he? Well, he certainly ought to know better. Surely \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Captain Owen is as used to the ways of the bazaar as I am, Your Highness. He does, after all, negotiate daily with informers.\\u2019 \\u2018Does he? Yes, well I suppose that's true. All the same, five thousand pounds! Surely that is excessive? What is the going rate for bodies in Cairo, Mr el Zaki? Much less than that, I would have thought. Much, much less. Twenty pounds? Fifty pounds at most. A hundred, very exceptionally. Yes, I would have thought this was worth a hundred only.\\u2019 \\u2018We are not exactly dealing in bodies,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018We are merely trying to buy information.\\u2019 \\u2018Not even a body? And five thousand pounds! The price looks higher every time you speak, Captain Owen. I really do not think bargaining is your line. Information, you say? What information?\\u2019 Owen was forced to admit he did not exactly know. \\u2018Well!\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018Five thousand pounds is a lot of money to pay for something you do not exactly know.\\u2019 \\u2018Before any money changed hands we would, of course, need to be satisfied that the information was worth it.\\u2019 \\u2018I would certainly hope so! But, tell me, Captain Owen, what do you expect would be the nature of this information for which you are prepared to pay so high a price?\\u2019 Owen was silent. Mahmoud was not, however. \\u2018Marks on the body,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018How she died.\\u2019 \\u2018I see.\\u2019 The Prince considered the matter thoughtfully. \\u2018Important as that is,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I am not sure that it is worth five thousand pounds. Certainly not to me. After all, if what I think you are supposing is true, it would hardly be in my interest for such information to emerge. I speak hypothetically, of course.\\u2019 \\u2018But look at it another way,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018If the information did not support what you think is Mr el Zaki's view, would it not be helpful to know this? Would it not, as it were, clear the matter up? And might not that be worth five thousand pounds?\\u2019 \\u2018I do see your point. But I would regard that as a matter of public, not private interest. And I think, therefore, that the public should pay.\\u2019 Owen tried in vain to convince him. The Prince was not to be persuaded. He played one last card. \\u2018Perhaps you are right,\\u2019 he said, with the air of one who had himself been convinced. \\u2018It is a public matter. The public should pay. Yes, I am sure you're right. I'll get on to it straightaway. It was just that \\u2014 well, I thought you might have a special interest in what we found out \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, I do! I do!\\u2019 '\\u2014 and not wish it to be shared too widely. After all, it could be misinterpreted.\\u2019 The Prince smiled. \\u2018I think I can rely on you to see that it is not. After all, in view of the Special Agreement currently being discussed between the British Government and the Egyptian Government \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018What Agreement is this?\\u2019 \\u2018You have not heard? Not even the Mamur Zapt? Well,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018I do call that news management of the highest order. Obviously something there for you to study. Yes, quite a lot there for you to study, I would say.\\u2019 He accompanied them to the door. As they parted, he clapped Owen on the back. \\u2018Don't be downhearted, old fellow. It's all for the best. You've been working jolly hard, I know. You and Mr el Zaki.\\u2019 The Prince's arm reached out to enfold Mahmoud. \\u2018But you've both got more important things to do, I'm sure.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't quite follow you.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018it's easy, isn't it? You've both been working very hard \\u2014 two of the best in the Khedive's service \\u2014 and you haven't been able to find anything. This \\u2014 proposal of yours, it's not going to come to anything, is it? I mean \\u2014 five thousand pounds is a lot of money. And for what? Some highly dubious information? Not worth it. I'm sure everyone will agree. So \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018So what?\\u2019 \\u2018Is not this the time to drop the whole affair? It's really becoming rather tedious. Worse, now I come to think of it, a positive drain on resources. Yes, that's it \\u2014 a drain on the Government's scarce resources. You see how quickly I pick up English ways of talking. We must act responsibly. Time to call a halt.\\u2019 \\u2018I am afraid, Your Highness,\\u2019 said Mahmoud stiffly, \\u2018that once a case has been opened \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018But has a case been opened, old fellow? A preliminary investigation, certainly. But a case?\\u2019 \\u2018We make no such distinction.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, I am sure you do. A report comes in. You investigate. You find there's nothing to it, a false rumour. So you drop it.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think this is like that.\\u2019 \\u2018You don't? Well,\\u2019 said the Prince, smiling, \\u2018I'm not sure I agree with you. No body, no case, I would have said. We'll see, shall we?\\u2019 Zeinab had set it up for Owen to meet her theatrical friends at their usual cafe and as she and Owen turned into the square, there they were, occupying their usual tables on the edge of the pavement. Intellectual life in Cairo was conducted, as in Paris, in  open-air cafes. It was conducted, too, in French since France was the country to which most of them owed intellectual allegiance. And the latest French journals were much in evidence. There was one respect, however, in which it was very un-French. There were no women seated at the tables. Emancipated as she considered herself, Zeinab would not have gone up to them alone. Even with Owen, she attracted some curious glances from people at adjoining tables. Women did not do that kind of thing, even in cosmopolitan Cairo. \\u2018Which was why Leila stood out,\\u2019 said one of Zeinab's friends, Gamal. Gamal was the playwright. \\u2018Oh yes. I remember that evening. It was the first night of New Roses, wasn't it? It had been so successful, mon cher \\u2014 the audience that first night was in rapture \\u2014 that I thought it would run and run. Alas!\\u2019 he sighed heavily. \\u2018It was the theme, Gamal,\\u2019 said someone across the table. \\u2018It just wasn't popular.\\u2019 He turned to Owen. \\u2018The \\u2018new roses\\u2019 were the emerging flowers of nationalism in the arts.\\u2019 \\u2018I would have thought that would have been pretty popular,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Nationalism, yes: the arts, no.\\u2019 \\u2018That accounts for it,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018The first night you had all the nationalists in Cairo. After that there was none left.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, my friend!\\u2019 said Gamal, laughing reprovingly. \\u2018And how did Leila come to be there?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Which of the aspects was she interested in?\\u2019 \\u2018Neither. She was interested in Suleiman.\\u2019 \\u2018Suleiman?\\u2019 \\u2018He is here, I think. Suleiman! Where are you? Suleiman?\\u2019 Someone sitting at a table at the far end of the cafe got up and came over to them. He and Gamal embraced enthusiastically. \\u2018Suleiman, there is someone I want you to meet.\\u2019 He introduced Owen. \\u2018A friend of mine. The Mamur Zapt.\\u2019 \\u2018The Mamur Zapt?\\u2019 said Suleiman, surprised but, so far as Owen could tell, not disconcerted. \\u2018What friends you have, Gamal!\\u2019 They shook hands and Suleiman pulled a chair up. \\u2018He wants to know about Leila,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018Leila?\\u2019 Suleiman made a face. \\u2018This is a shaming thing for me, Gamal. It is not kind of you.\\u2019 \\u2018Why be ashamed?\\u2019 asked Gamal. \\u2018Is not love a thing to be proud of?\\u2019 \\u2018It is, when it is love. But I am not sure it was love, not on my side at least.\\u2019 \\u2018She loved you?\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Well, yes, I think so. And at first I felt flattered \\u2014 I don't usually have an effect on women like that \\u2014 and thought I loved her. But then\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018You fell out of love?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, no. It was just that she became \\u2014 tiresome, really, she was so dinging. And then I thought: It is not I she finds special, any responsive man would do, it is the fact of being in love she finds special. I am not expressing myself very well.\\u2019 \\u2018Being in love is special for women,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Yes, yes. I realize that, but I think that also there has to be one man particularly who means something special to you \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018There were other men?\\u2019 \\u2018No, no. I did not mean that. I meant, I think, that it is very important to Leila, or it was then, to have a man, simply have a man. Any man would do, it didn't have to be me. It was as if she was desperate \\u2014 No, no, I didn't mean that. What a terrible thing to say! I meant \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018She needed love and protection,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Suleiman, downcast. \\u2018Yes, I am sure you are right. Only \\u2014 I'm not very good at that sort of thing. I \\u2014 I want to get on with my work.\\u2019 \\u2018Suleiman is a sculptor,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018Well, I am trying to be,\\u2019 said Suleiman modestly. \\u2018Not very successfully, I am afraid. But I did have the chance of an exhibition, and it was just at that time, and I was working hard, and she \\u2014 she, well, I suppose she was a distraction.\\u2019 \\u2018Is it just that he is like you?\\u2019 Zeinab asked Owen. \\u2018Or are all men like this?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know about that,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018But I know that if you are an artist, that is how it is.\\u2019 \\u2018It is not art that needs new roses,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018it is the way men see women.\\u2019 Owen hurriedly intervened. \\u2018At any rate,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018you felt less warmly towards her than you had done.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. But she wouldn't let me go. She clung.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you expect?\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018A woman's love is not like a man's. Once you give it, you can't take it back.\\u2019 \\u2018She pursued you?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. Everywhere I went.\\u2019 \\u2018And that was how she came to be at the reception?\\u2019 \\u2018What reception is this?\\u2019 \\u2018The first night of Gamal's play, New Roses. There was a reception afterwards.\\u2019 \\u2018I remember it. Was she there? Yes, I think she was there.\\u2019 \\u2018Was she invited?\\u2019 \\u2018No one was invited,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018It just happened.\\u2019 \\u2018She tagged along.\\u2019 \\u2018Did she come with you?\\u2019 \\u2018No. I don't think she came with anyone. But when I came into the room, there she was. And I thought: There she is again! Will I never be rid of her? This is what I am ashamed of,\\u2019 said Suleiman. \\u2018It was unkind.\\u2019 \\u2018Did you speak to her?\\u2019 \\u2018No. I tried to avoid her. In fact, I did avoid her. She did not speak to me.\\u2019 \\u2018Was that because she was speaking to someone else?\\u2019 'I do not know.\\u2019 There was a general appeal around the tables. \\u2018Who did Leila speak to at the New Roses party?\\u2019 One or two names were suggested. \\u2018The Prince, I think,\\u2019 said someone. \\u2018Narouz?\\u2019 'Yes. It was the only thing he found interesting during the evening, I think.\\u2019 'The man is a Philistine,\\u2019 declared Gamal. \\u2018What was he doing there, anyway?\\u2019 'Raoul was trying to tap him for money.\\u2019 'Some hope. He's only interested in car racing.\\u2019 'Women?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Leila, certainly. They went off together. Sorry, Suleiman.\\u2019 'I don't mind,\\u2019said Suleiman. \\u2018In fact, it's a relief.\\u2019 'How did you get to know her?\\u2019 'She turned up, didn't she, at one of our soirees?\\u2019he appealed to the group. \\u2018Faisal brought her.\\u2019 'Who is Faisal?\\u2019 'Oh, he's not one of us. He hung around us for a while. He thought he was interested in the arts. One of those rich men, you know, no talent, no dedication. He went off to France.\\u2019 'And Leila?\\u2019 'Leila stayed. She started going around with \\u2014 who was it? That journalist.\\u2019 'Hargazy?\\u2019 'That's right. She went around with him for a while. Off and on. I don't know when it stopped.\\u2019 'When she took up with Suleiman.\\u2019 'She was always tagging along with someone.\\u2019 'What else could she do?\\u2019 asked Zeinab with asperity. \\u2018Did she have any other friends?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018I wouldn't have thought so. Judging by the amount of time she spent with us.\\u2019 \\u2018Why all these questions?\\u2019 asked someone. \\u2018Because she's dead,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Dead?\\u2019 They were shocked. \\u2018When was this? Are you sure? I saw her only recently,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018It was Tuesday,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Tuesday when she was killed.\\u2019 \\u2018We don't know that for cert \\u2014\\u2019 began Owen, but his voice was drowned in the barrage of questions, cries of concern and comment. \\u2018But that is awful!\\u2019 \\u2018Leila! I cannot believe it!\\u2019 \\u2018I didn't know her well, but \\u2014 somehow one had got used to her.\\u2019 \\u2018None of us knew her well, I suppose.\\u2019 \\u2018Didn't any of you ever talk to her?\\u2019 demanded Zeinab. \\u2018Of course we did. We all spoke to her.\\u2019 \\u2018That's not the same thing. Did you ever talk to her in the way she wanted? Needed?\\u2019 \\u2018Suleiman did.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not sure I did,\\u2019 said Suleiman thoughtfully, \\u2018now.\\u2019 Zeinab was very quiet afterwards as she and Owen drove home in an arabeah. Cairo was at its most magical. The streets were still and cool and silver in the moonlight. The shadows of the minarets made gentle curves in the dust and when Owen looked up, there they were, graceful against the deep blue of the Egyptian night. He bent over and kissed her. Zeinab kissed him back mechanically. She was thinking about Leila. \\u2018She was very alone, wasn't she?\\u2019 \\u2018If you leave home you are alone.\\u2019 \\u2018If you're a woman,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018She must have wanted to leave home terribly badly. Maybe I ought to take a look at her family.\\u2019 \\u2018Perhaps it wasn't so much that she wanted to leave home. Perhaps it was more that she just wanted to be somewhere else. Be someone else.\\u2019 Later, she looked up at him. The moonlight was on her face and he could see her clearly. \\u2018You are going to do something about it, aren't you?\\u2019 she said. The next morning, though, he found a message on his desk from Paul, asking if they could meet for a drink at lunchtime at the Club. They took their drinks out on to the verandah where they would not be disturbed. \\u2018I'm not following you,\\u2019 said Owen, bewildered. \\u2018I thought you wanted me to stay close to it?\\u2019 \\u2018Not so close. Keep a gentle eye on it from afar.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, fine. I can do that,\\u2019 said Owen, shrugging his shoulders. \\u2018It's Mahmoud's pigeon really. I'm just there to see, well, that it doesn't build up into anything major.\\u2019 \\u2018That's right.\\u2019 Paul nodded approvingly. \\u2018We wouldn't want that, so continue keeping an eye on it. But from afar. No need to involve yourself directly. Ease off a bit. I'm sure you've got plenty of other things to do.\\u2019 \\u2018I have, yes. There's a lot on just at the moment. But-I'm still a bit puzzled. I thought this was important?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, hardly. Certainly not in itself. An accident, a murder \\u2014 they come with the ice-cream in Cairo. It was just that this could have had political implications.\\u2019 \\u2018And you don't think that's likely now?\\u2019 \\u2018I think there are more important political considerations.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, fine, you would know. Mahmoud will be getting on with it anyway. He doesn't need me.\\u2019 For all Paul's highly developed, possibly over-developed, political sense, he was normally straight with Owen. After  all, he explained, politics wasn't everything \\u2014 what about drink, for instance?\\u2014 and if you couldn't be trusted to call properly when you were playing tennis, who would want to play with you? Now he was toying uncomfortably with his glass. \\u2018I have a feeling,\\u2019 he said at last, \\u2018that Mahmoud may be receiving the same sort of advice.\\u2019 \\u2018To back off? What's going on?\\u2019 Light dawned. \\u2018You can't \\u2014 you don't mean to say you're giving in to Narouz?\\u2019 \\u2018Certainly not! Narouz is just a sideshow, a distraction. The fact is, though, that we could do without a distraction just now.\\u2019 \\u2018It's this Special Agreement, is it?\\u2019 \\u2018How do you know about that? It's supposed to be top, pinnacle-top, secret. Only the Consul-General and the Khedive are supposed to know.\\u2019 \\u2018You know.\\u2019 \\u2018I am the right side of the Consul-General's brain. How do you know?\\u2019 \\u2018I have access to the left side of the Khedive's brain.\\u2019 \\u2018You keep your spies in peculiar places, Gareth.\\u2019 \\u2018I do. But they didn't tell me about this. Nor that you were giving in to Narouz.\\u2019 \\u2018We're not giving in to Narouz. It's just that we don't want anything to ruffle the Khedive's hair just when the negotiations are approaching a delicate stage.\\u2019 \\u2018Narouz is a sideshow. You said it yourself.\\u2019 \\u2018The Khedive will have to carry his family with him. Potential heirs, at least. The Treaty is to do with a possible extension of the British presence here in return for continuing political support. And cash, of course.\\u2019 \\u2018And Narouz is one of the heirs?\\u2019 \\u2018Potential. Only potential.\\u2019 \\u2018So you don't want us to press this case?\\u2019 \\u2018Are you in a position to press a case?\\u2019 \\u2018No, not yet.\\u2019 \\u2018Why don't you just leave it like that? Let it roll along, latent, so to speak. It'll mean we've got a hold over him. We might use it some time.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know if Mahmoud will play.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think Mahmoud will have any option. Not if he's formally taken off the case.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know that I want to play, either.\\u2019 \\u2018Now, Gareth, no moral heroics, please!\\u2019 \\u2018It's not moral heroics, it's Zeinab. She's rather got the bit between her teeth on this.\\u2019 \\u2018Zeinab? How the hell does she come to be involved? She's not a friend of the girl, is she?\\u2019 \\u2018No. Has friends who are. It's not that. It's \\u2014 well, an abstract principle of justice, I suppose.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, come, Gareth! Zeinab's not interested in an abstract anything! A more concrete, realistic girl I've never met. Emotional, perhaps, but \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018She's pretty emotionally involved here.\\u2019 \\u2018How the hell did she get to be emotionally involved? How the hell did she get to be involved anyway? Gareth! You've been talking to her! Is that it?\\u2019 \\u2018A bit.\\u2019 \\u2018You daft idiot! Couldn't you see that she would get emotionally involved?\\u2019 \\u2018We've talked about things before.\\u2019 \\u2018About girls trying to strike out alone in Egypt? I'll bet you haven't.\\u2019 \\u2018It has not arisen,\\u2019 said Owen stiffly. \\u2018Can you imagine Zeinab talking about a thing like that and not getting emotionally involved? Zeinab would get emotionally involved if she was talking about breakfast.\\u2019 \\u2018We've got to talk about something, haven't we?\\u2019 \\u2018Your work? That the sort of thing you talk about in bed, Gareth? You worry me. You sound more and more like-I've got to say it \\u2014 yes, a husband, Gareth.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think things have got quite as far as that yet:\\u2019 \\u2018They seem to me to be drifting that way. And if they are, then I think you want to think about it, Gareth. Because I can see problems. Zeinab's a lovely girl, but \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018For Christ's sake, Paul!\\u2019 \\u2018I know, I know. All the same\\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Let's get off the relationships. You were giving me instructions.\\u2019 \\u2018Advice, I was giving you. Advice.\\u2019 \\u2018Advice. Back off the investigation. Leave it all alone. Let Narouz get away with it.\\u2019 \\u2018That was not my advice. Timing was what I was talking about. And the balance between political and personal priorities.\\u2019 \\u2018I get the message.\\u2019 \\u2018I hope you do. Especially the bit about balance.\\u2019 \\u2018I do. But will Zeinab?\\u2019 CHAPTER 6 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Look, let's not be too hasty \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018I do not understand. First you are on this case, then you are off. One moment you give all your time to it, you don't come home till late at night, you don't even come home in the afternoon like ordinary men, the next you are giving no time to it at all. Is it the same man, I ask myself?\\u2019 \\u2018Of course it's the same man. It's just that \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Don't you care at all what you do? Or is it that your feelings suddenly alter? They switch and change all the time, phu! like this. You are,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018emotionally erratic.\\u2019 \\u2018It's nothing to do with emotion \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Oh?\\u2019 said Zeinab, bridling. \\u2018You don't care about Leila? You don't care about a poor girl, alone and brutally murdered? You have no feeling? Is that it?\\u2019 \\u2018No, that's not it. Of course I care. But \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018She is only a woman, is that it?\\u2019 said Zeinab, firing up. \\u2018An Egyptian woman, yes? What is a mere Egyptian woman to the mighty British? They brush her aside, yes, like a fly.\\u2019 \\u2018Calm down, calm down! I am very concerned \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Concern! Pah! Is that all? I am concerned too. I am concerned that you have a heart of stone. I am concerned that with you one minute it is this, the next it is that. I am concerned that the man who is here today is not the same as the man who was here yesterday. I \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018OK, OK.\\u2019 This was going to be as difficult as he had imagined. \\u2018It's not me that changes,\\u2019 he said mildly. \\u2018It's just that \\u2014 well, circumstances change.\\u2019 \\u2018And you change with them, yes? Just like that. Something happens and immediately you change.\\u2019 \\u2018No. It's not like that.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not? Well, it seems to me just like that. We talk, we agree, I go away and start doing something, and then suddenly it's all different. It all changes. You blow hot, you blow cold. You go to bed saying one thing, you wake up saying another.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not like that.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, isn't it? I am glad. Because I thought perhaps it was the same with me. Now you love me, now you don't.\\u2019 \\u2018You know I love you.\\u2019 \\u2018But that,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018is precisely what I don't know. Now that we have all this change. You loved me yesterday, or so I believed. Yes, I believed you. But tomorrow? Will you love me then?\\u2019 The large dark eyes stared at him tragically. Owen, who had suspected that Zeinab was enjoying the drama, melted totally. \\u2018Of course I will!\\u2019 \\u2018You say it,\\u2019 said Zeinab sombrely, \\u2018as if you meant it. But then, you spoke about Leila in that way too.\\u2019 \\u2018That's different.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh? Why is it different?\\u2019 \\u2018That \\u2014 well, that's work.\\u2019 \\u2018I do not make that distinction,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018At work you've got to go along with things more. You're subject to pressures.\\u2019 \\u2018I see.\\u2019 She sat there silently for a few moments. Owen hoped that she was calming down. \\u2018That's it, is it?\\u2019 she said suddenly. \\u2018What?\\u2019 \\u2018Pressure.\\u2019 \\u2018Arguments, rather.\\u2019 \\u2018And you have been persuaded by these arguments?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, I haven't,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018You haven't heard them,\\u2019 Owen pointed out. \\u2018You won't tell me them. You can't,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018tell me them. And do you know why? Because they are British arguments. They are not my arguments, they are not even your arguments. They are British arguments.\\u2019 She suddenly dissolved into floods of tears. \\u2018I hate you!\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I hate you!\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, look \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018No. Don't touch me. It is not the man I love who touches me, it is the British.\\u2019 \\u2018You mustn't see it like that!\\u2019 \\u2018I see it like that because it is like that.\\u2019 \\u2018It is not like that.\\u2019 \\u2018No? Tell me then: are you going to do what they say?\\u2019 \\u2018Well \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018You see,\\u2019 said Zeinab. Mahmoud had a case that morning in the Mixed Tribunals and Owen wanted to send a letter to England so they agreed to meet at noon at the Post Office. Mahmoud wasn't there when he arrived, so he went inside to buy his stamps and then came out to use the wet roller hanging against the wall. The heat tended to dry up  the gum on stamps and getting them to stick on was the very devil. Facing the front of the Post Office was a long row of seal-makers and scribes squatting in the dust with their customers. The ordinary Egyptian could not write and if he wished to send a letter he would have to get a scribe to write it for him. And since he could not sign it he would use a seal. Owen wondered suddenly whether Leila had been able to write. Almost certainly not, for few women could. How, then, did Narouz communicate with her? If by note, then she would have had to get a scribe to read it to her. But perhaps Narouz sent a messenger. In either case the man would know the message: and in either case they ought to be able to find him. But he was forgetting. Mahmoud came out of the Mixed Tribunals and crossed the street towards him. He was carrying a huge bundle of papers and didn't want to walk far, so they went into the Arab cafe beside the Post Office. Mahmoud dumped the papers on a chair and sat down with relief. He had, he told Owen, been on his feet all morning. \\u2018Did you get anywhere?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018The usual.\\u2019 The Egyptian system of courts was one of the most complicated in the world. Foreigners in Egypt received considerable legal privileges. In some cases they could be tried only by their own national courts and cases had to be remitted to Smyrna or Ankara or wherever it was. In other cases, where an Egyptian national was involved as well as a foreigner, the case had to be sent to the Mixed Courts, where the law was different from that in the ordinary Egyptian courts. The possibilities for evasion were endless. Owen commiserated. Mahmoud shrugged his shoulders. \\u2018You get used to it,\\u2019 he said. He was, understandably, not very cheerful this morning. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018they told me yesterday.\\u2019 \\u2018What did they tell you? To drop it?\\u2019 \\u2018No, no. They wouldn't do that. If a case is closed, you've got to say why. Sometimes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018bureaucracy has its uses.\\u2019 \\u2018What did they tell you, then?\\u2019 \\u2018Basically, to leave it alone for a while. A long, long while. To concentrate on something else. That's why,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, tapping the bundle of papers, \\u2018they've given me this. I had to get it all up last night. I've got another one for tomorrow. And the day after. I don't think,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018they trust me to do nothing.\\u2019 He laughed, but it was an injured, bitter laugh. If you were a Parquet lawyer you got used to cases getting nowhere; but that didn't mean you liked it. \\u2018It's Narouz, isn't it?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018He's fixed it.\\u2019 Owen nodded. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018it was always on the cards. He's a member of the Royal Family. They wouldn't want to go too close to the Khedive. What I can't understand, though, is why the British should want to get involved.\\u2019 \\u2018They don't want to get involved. All they want to do is make sure it doesn't blow up into anything.\\u2019 \\u2018For the sake of the Khedive?\\u2019 \\u2018Certainly not for the sake of Narouz.\\u2019 Mahmoud, fortunately, did not probe. \\u2018I wouldn't have thought they'd have bothered,\\u2019 he said. It was the custom in Egypt, on the Friday after a body had been interred, for the women of the family to visit the tomb, where they would break a palm branch over the grave and distribute cakes and bread to the poor. When Ali Marwash's daughter died the custom was followed to the letter since the girl was Ali Marwash's only child and he cared for her more then he probably would have done had there been sons in the family. The mourners went to the tomb and a fiki, a professional holy reader, especially hired for the occasion, chanted the appropriate verses from the Koran. The palm branch was broken and placed on the grave and the cakes and bread distributed. The party was about to depart when the mother of the dead girl noticed that the earth over the entrance to the tomb had been disturbed, and when she looked more closely she saw that one of the roofing stones had been moved. Grave-robbing in Egypt was a traditional pursuit and she immediately feared the worst. Ali Marwash was not a rich man, but he had loved his daughter and had wrapped her in a Kashmir shawl before interring her. It was normal to tear the shawl first so that its value would not tempt a profane person to violate the tomb; but the shawl had been a beautiful one and he had not been able to bring himself to do that. His wife now feared that they had been punished for his presumption. Her screams attracted a large crowd and the fiki, taking control, sent someone to fetch her husband. A sheikh was summoned and with his authority and before a vast concourse of onlookers the tomb was reopened. The mother's fears were realized, for the tomb had indeed been violated. Her daughter's body had been removed altogether. And in its place, stacked high in the subterranean vault, was a large pile of guns and ammunition. The police were called at once and the District Chief of Police, whose recent experiences had reinforced a strong natural tendency towards caution, sent immediately for the Mamur Zapt. By the time Owen arrived the crowd was sixty deep and he had to get his constables to clear a way through. The tomb consisted of an oblong brick vault with an arched roof high enough to allow a person buried in it to sit up with care when visited by the two examining angels, Munkar and Nekeer. On top of this was a solid brick monument with an upright stone. The entrance was through a  small separate cell to the north-east, and it was this which had been tampered with. Owen stepped down into the cell, bent and looked through the doorway into the burial vault. At first he could not see anything, but then someone pushed a lighted torch in front of him and he caught the gleam of the bluish-grey metal inside. It was a large cache of arms. He pulled one out. It was a rifle in pristine condition, still greasy from the packing case and with the heavy, cold distinctive smell he knew so well. The man holding the torch was, he saw now, one of the local constables he had used on the arms search. \\u2018Is this it, effendi?\\u2019 said the man excitedly. Owen slipped his hand in again and felt around on the floor. His hand closed around an object. He pulled it out and looked at it. It was a clip of ammunition, exactly similar to those left behind in the kuttub in the fountain-house. \\u2018Oh, good,\\u2019 said Garvin, \\u2018I was afraid you'd forgotten about things like that, with your recent preoccupations.\\u2019 He was, nevertheless, in a genial mood this morning. A bearer slipped in behind Owen and stood up a gun in the corner behind Garvin's desk. That accounted for it. It was a sporting gun. \\u2018Bag anything this morning?\\u2019 \\u2018Two hare and a hoopoe.\\u2019 \\u2018Hoopoe?\\u2019 \\u2018It happened to be there so I potted it.\\u2019 It was possible to get good, though restricted, shooting within an hour's ride from Cairo and sometimes Garvin went out in the early morning before coming to the office. For duck you needed really to go north, to the big lakes around Alexandria and, of course, for big game you had to go south. But hare and even the odd gazelle were available locally. Like many of the British, Garvin brought his past with  him. He was the son of a \\u2018squarson\\u2019, a country parson who had the standing and habits of a squire. Garvin had been brought up to hunting and shooting, skills which in the opinion of the Consul-General exactly equipped a young man for a career in the Ministry of the Interior. Those and one other: facility at learning Arabic. Cromer had expected all his staff to speak Arabic fluently and Garvin, after twenty years in Egypt, spoke the language like a native. He also knew the country like a native. \\u2018Oh, good,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Foolish of them,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018They must have known the women would be back.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think they meant to leave them there,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018They had to move them in a hurry when my people started going through the district and it was just intended as a temporary hiding-place. My guess is that they meant to come back, only with so much police activity they didn't like to risk it.\\u2019 \\u2018So all that farting around actually achieved something?\\u2019 \\u2018The operation was successful, yes. The trouble is,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018that it was only partly successful. We got the arms but not the men.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, at least it means that if we're shot, it'll be by another lot of guns. That's something.\\u2019 \\u2018There'll be other shipments. We've got to get the men. So I'm keeping some people down in Al-Gadira.\\u2019 \\u2018They'll be miles away by now,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018I don't know that they will. My hunch is that they're local. Why did they move the arms in the first place? Because they saw the search coming their way. That suggests they were in the area. What did they do? They moved them out of the way but not out of the district, just to somewhere handy where they could easily pick them up. That suggests they were local, too.\\u2019 Garvin nodded his head in acknowledgement. \\u2018Who have you got down there?\\u2019 \\u2018Georgiades.\\u2019 \\u2018He's all right,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018Yes. There's another thing, too. While he's down there he can keep his eyes open generally. There seems to be a lot happening in Al-Gadira just now.\\u2019 He told Garvin about Leila. \\u2018That girl?\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018I thought you were dropping that?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm distancing myself. But I couldn't help noticing that was Al-Gadira too.\\u2019 \\u2018Coincidence,\\u2019 said Garvin dismissively. \\u2018Maybe. But she lived there and she died there.\\u2019 \\u2018Her body was washed up there. That's not the same thing.\\u2019 \\u2018It's what happened to her body.\\u2019 \\u2018Half way to Alexandria by now, I would say.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018it might not be.\\u2019 \\u2018Does it matter?\\u2019 asked Garvin. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Owen. He found it difficult to pick the right words. Everything that came to mind seemed inappropriate. He wanted to say \\u2018untidy\\u2019 but that was ridiculously inappropriate. Then he wanted to say that you couldn't have bodies floating around but \\u2018floating\\u2019, in the circumstances, was hardly the word. \\u2018It might pop up at an awkward moment,\\u2019 he said, which was hardly any better.\\u2019 \\u2018We'll have to risk that,\\u2019 said Garvin briskly. Owen was deliberating whether this was the moment. Garvin seemed fairly amenable this morning. He might never have a better chance. \\u2018I wonder if we're handling this in the right way,\\u2019 he said cautiously. He didn't need to work through Garvin. Although Garvin was shown as his formal superior in terms of the office organization chart, that was to some extent a convenient fiction and the Mamur Zapt had his own lines of communication to the powers that were. Garvin, however, played bridge with the Consul-General  and was a member of his social circle. The habit of the British overseas was to replicate the governing patterns of the Establishment in London, with its loose formal structure and very tight informal one, articulated through a wide variety of social occasions, and Egypt was no exception. Owen was, he was aware, a hired man and not a member of the charmed social circle and if he wanted to get things done he had to do it indirectly by tweaking the inner social system. \\u2018What do you mean?\\u2019 said Garvin, looking at him sharply. \\u2018Letting Narouz block it. It's bound to get out and then it will look as if we're helping the Khedive to cover up. Is that a good idea?\\u2019 \\u2018He's the Government, isn't he?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, but this kind of thing gives the Government a bad name. Do we want to be all that closely identified with the Government over a thing like this?\\u2019 \\u2018A thing like what?\\u2019 \\u2018Corruption. Possible murder.\\u2019 \\u2018What are you saying?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm saying we should let Mahmoud go on investigating this case. Seriously, I mean.\\u2019 Garvin looked at him searchingly, then looked away. \\u2018There are one or two things on at the moment,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I know. The Agreement.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, then.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't see that the two have to go together.\\u2019 \\u2018They go together,\\u2019 said Garvin, \\u2018because the only legal basis we have for being in Egypt is that we're here by the Khedive's invitation. It's a personal thing, there's no formal treaty or anything like that. It's just his invitation. And he's prepared to renew it, provided we're prepared to look after him and see he stays in power.\\u2019 \\u2018Would a thing like this stop him from staying in power?\\u2019 \\u2018It might.\\u2019 \\u2018We don't have to do everything he wants,\\u2019 said Owen, exasperated. \\u2018Certainly not. But we do have to do everything he wants for the next month or so.\\u2019 \\u2018I was hoping,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018that you might be able to have a word \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018I'm afraid not,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018This is unreasonable,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018On the contrary,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018You don't love me; so why should we make love?\\u2019 \\u2018I do love you.\\u2019 \\u2018You don't listen to me,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018let alone love me.\\u2019 \\u2018I am doing what I can. I've been trying to persuade them \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Persuade them?\\u2019 said Zeinab incredulously. \\u2018Do you have to persuade people to do what is obviously right?\\u2019 \\u2018They don't see it like that. They \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Why do you always have to take their point of view?\\u2019 \\u2018I am not taking their point of view. I am working within it. \\u2018I do not follow these sophistries,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018If I do it too directly they won't listen to me.\\u2019 \\u2018They don't listen to you. You don't listen to me. It is time,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018that the whole lot of you started listening.\\u2019 \\u2018Listen \\u2014\\u2019 \\u20181,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018always listen.\\u2019 \\u2018No, you don't. Try and hear what I am saying. I am doing something about it, I am trying to get them to change their mind. I am spending about all my time on the bloody thing \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Leila,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Is that what you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018The case. And it's not even my case. I am not really on it. It's not really anything to do with me.\\u2019 \\u2018An injustice occurs,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018and it's not really anything to do with you?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm just trying to do a job. I am not trying to put the whole world right. That's something God can do.\\u2019 \\u2018The old Mamur Zapt,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018would have listened.\\u2019 \\u2018The old Mamur Zapt was a crook.\\u2019 \\u2018And had a weakness for women. There are,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018many similarities between you. Nevertheless \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Look, in the old days the Mamur Zapt was responsible for bloody everything in the city. My role is more circumscribed.\\u2019 \\u2018Call yourself Mamur Zapt and you can't do anything when the woman you claim you love pleads to you for justice?\\u2019 \\u2018Look, I'm just concerned with political things \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018There we have it!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. And that's not the same thing as ordinary criminal offences. Why don't you go to the Parquet?\\u2019 \\u2018The Parquet,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018is not political, no? I thought you told me they were a bunch of political, fix-it lawyers? I thought you told me that everything is in the end political? Ah, I see! It is another of these now-it-is, now-it-isn't things. Like your love!\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Not like my love at all.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, but I think it is! And so,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018since you do not love me, properly, not truly, not the way I love you, it would not be right for us to make love.\\u2019 \\u2018All right, then,\\u2019 said Owen, getting up. \\u2018If you feel like that.\\u2019 \\u2018I do feel like that. And my feelings are not changeable like yours. I shall feel the same tomorrow.\\u2019 \\u2018Bloody hell!\\u2019 \\u2018And every day, in fact. Until you have made your mind up. The right way, of course.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, that is a problem!\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018Should it have priority over the future of the British Empire, though? Ordinarily I  would say yes without hesitation. On this occasion, however \\u2014\\u2019 They were sitting outside on the verandah. Stretching into the distance were the various sports fields of the Club. Far away a hockey match was in progress. The standard of hockey was good. Most officials in Egypt and all the army had served in India. Because of the heat, matches were played in the late afternoon. They had to start promptly at four, however, since the twilight came early in Egypt and by six it was getting too dark to see. There were tennis courts as well. Because you lost so much body water in the heat, small boys brought tumblers of iced water at the end of every set. Even so, by the end of a match you were seriously depleted and most players repaired to the bar to rebuild their resources. \\u2018We must look for a compromise,\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018I don't think Zeinab goes in for compromises much,\\u2019 said Owen gloomily. \\u2018It's all or nothing with her. At the moment it's nothing.\\u2019 \\u2018You mustn't give up,\\u2019 said Paul firmly. \\u2018We've got the best brains in Egypt on this. Yours and mine.\\u2019 \\u2018Where politics is concerned,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018that is probably true. In your case, at any rate. In things like this, though \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018All problems are in the end political. Wasn't that what you said she said?\\u2019 \\u2018She said I said it.\\u2019 \\u2018And it was very perceptive of you. So let's treat this as a political problem and look for a political solution.\\u2019 \\u2018No, no, no, no. It won't work, I tell you. The only thing that would help would be if we could finish off this Leila business.\\u2019 \\u2018There you are! I told you the problem was a political one.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, and you also told me, yesterday, that you couldn't do a thing about it.\\u2019 \\u2018That was yesterday and I was solving a different problem then.\\u2019 Paul, looking over the fields, considered the matter. There was an indignant shout from the hockey players. A hawk had swooped low over the field of play, picked up the ball in its claws and flown off with it. The ball, however, was too big for it and dropped from its clutch. The referee retrieved it and ordered a bully-off. \\u2018We must do something about those birds,\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018They're becoming a problem.\\u2019 \\u2018Is there a political solution for that, too?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Firepower,\\u2019 said Paul, undisconcerted. \\u2018War is the extension of politics by other means.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think that will help with Zeinab.\\u2019 \\u2018Compromise,\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018That's what we've got to go for.\\u2019 \\u2018I tell you Zeinab isn't interested in compromise.\\u2019 \\u2018She adopts a strong negotiating position.\\u2019 \\u2018No, no, it's not like that, Paul. She means what she says.\\u2019 \\u2018Heavens! Unorthodox, too! That does require some thought.\\u2019 A whistle blew and the match ended. The hockey players trooped off and began to make their way back towards the clubhouse. \\u2018The only way forward I can see,\\u2019 said Paul, \\u2018is to distribute the problem through time.\\u2019 'What!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, that's it. It's simpler than I had thought. In political terms, that is. It's just a straightforward bargaining situation distributed over time.\\u2019 \\u2018What the hell are you talking about, Paul?\\u2019 \\u2018You see, Zeinab's not going to move until the Leila business gets settled. The Leila business is not going to get settled until the Agreement gets signed. (I mean, afterwards who cares a damn what Narouz thinks or does?) So all you've got to do is wait for the Agreement to get signed. Then you can get going on the case. And then, when you've  got that sorted out, things will get sorted out with Zeinab, too.\\u2019 \\u2018How long is all that going to take?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, if there's no hiccup in the negotiations, the Agreement will be signed within a couple of months or so.\\u2019 \\u2018You mean wait a couple of months? And then sort the case out? And only then \\u2014?\\u2019 \\u2018We all have to make sacrifices, Gareth.\\u2019 By about ten in the morning the sun was already dazzlingly bright and all living objects were seeking the shade. One of the orderlies came round closing the shutters. The room was plunged into darkness and stayed like that for the rest of the day. At first it was cool and rather pleasant but as the day wore on, the temperature in the room rose. You opened the door into the corridor but not the window into the sun and that way you got \\u2014 but perhaps this was fancy \\u2014 a draught of air. I here were fans suspended from the ceilings in each of the rooms but in Owen's view all they did was to move hot air from one place to another and he very rarely switched his on. Besides, they blew the papers all over the place. This morning was papers. He had a pile on his desk which he was working systematically through; reports from agents, neatly docketed and summarized by Nikos, offensive memoranda from the Finance Department, irrelevant offerings from Personnel and aggrieved submissions from the Khedive, the Kadi, the Mufti and all the others who considered that the Mamur Zapt was exceeding his powers. He pushed them all aside. On the end of the desk was a heap of newspapers. The ones he had were in Arabic, French and English. The ones in Italian, Greek, Armenian, Turkish and Amharic would go to other people in the office. Cairo was a polyglot community and had a lively press. Too lively on occasion. One of the Mamur Zapt's duties was to read the press before publication and excise any  passage he considered inflammatory. Censorship? Call it ensuring that people's feelings were not offended. He picked up one of the newspapers and began reading. It was the influential Al-Liwa, nationalist in sympathies and radical in tone. Also windy rhetorical in tone. It was heavy going. His attention wandered. What was he going to do? He had tried all his usual lines, Paul, Garvin, others, the ones he always used when he wanted to get official policy reversed or amended, and he had got nowhere. The Administration, this time, was showing unusual unanimity. Obviously, the Agreement mattered. Well, he didn't mind that; it mattered to him, too. He wanted to stay in Egypt, didn't he? And, unfortunately, that meant going along with the Khedive. They were there by his invitation and only by his invitation. The other powers didn't like it \\u2014 they wanted Britain to get out of Egypt \\u2014 but so long as the fiction could be maintained that the British were there at the express request of the Egyptian sovereign, there was not much they could do about it. Owen was all for the Agreement. He was also, on the whole, for the Khedive on the grounds that at least he was the devil they knew. True, there were some things he didn't like about the Khedive's regime, the patronage, the corruption, the inefficiency. He could understand the desire of people like Mahmoud for reform and change. Well, they could certainly have change. The British Government in London, the Administration itself in Egypt, was committed to Progress. Within limits, of course. But it had to be gradual, orderly change, sensible reform, rather on the British model. He was all in favour of that. And there was no real discrepancy, either, between that \\u2014 in general\\u2014 and the Agreement. It was only when they got down to the particular that problems arose. And Zeinab, unfortunately, tended to think in terms of the particular. It must be something to do, he decided, with her lack of a formal education. She was very difficult to reason with. He couldn't see much hope that way. But nor could he see much hope any other way. He had tried all other things he knew. Everywhere, the way was blocked. What was he going to do? And then, as his eye flicked mechanically over the page, it caught something tucked away at the bottom of one of the columns. Chapter 7 \\u2018How did they get hold of that?\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018I could ask them,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018but would that be a good idea?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Garvin, pushing the newspaper back to him, \\u2018I suppose you are right.\\u2019 \\u2018It would just give it more prominence. They would know they were on to something.\\u2019 \\u2018You're not going to let it go out, though?\\u2019 \\u2018No, I've cut it, along with a lot of other passages. It's just one among many. They may think it's just because it contains a reference to the Khedive's family.\\u2019 Garvin looked at the passage again. \\u2018I don't think they'll think that,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Then what would you suggest we do?\\u2019 \\u2018I'll have to take advice,\\u2019 said Garvin. He drummed his fingers on his desk. \\u2018Owen,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018doesn't this come a bit pat?\\u2019 \\u2018What do you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018You've been trying to get us not to hush this case up.\\u2019 \\u2018I've been trying to get you not to block it.\\u2019 \\u2018Same thing. I was wondering \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018If I'd leaked this myself?\\u2019 \\u2018Did you?\\u2019 \\u2018No.\\u2019 \\u2018It falls a little conveniently.\\u2019 Owen shrugged. He picked up the newspaper and read the passage again. It read: A young woman, Miss Leila Sekhmet, was drowned in the river last week. Apparently, she fell off a boat. That is strange, for the boat was moored for the last night and the river was calm. What is even stranger is that the boat was a dahayeeyah under the hire of Prince Narouz. What was a young, unmarried girl doing at night on the Prince's dayabeeyah, we wonder? And what happened, that a girl should fall overboard? The Parquet are investigating. \\u2018It would be interesting to know how they got it,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018The information is good.\\u2019 \\u2018So good,\\u2019 said Garvin, \\u2018that \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018I must have given it them?\\u2019 Owen smiled. \\u2018I might have,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018if I'd thought of it. But even if I did, we're still left with the same question: What are we going to do about it? \\u2018It's put the cat among the pigeons,\\u2019 said Paul. \\u2018It really has. You're sure nothing to do with it?\\u2019 \\u2018Cross my heart.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm all for sharp manoeuvres, Gareth, but I like to be on the inside of them.\\u2019 \\u2018Haven't I always kept you on the inside of them?\\u2019 \\u2018So long as it stays like that.\\u2019 \\u2018It'll stay like that. Anyway, I don't go in for sharp manoeuvres much myself. I always come to you for them.\\u2019 Paul sighed. \\u2018Why do I allow myself to be persuaded by this unscrupulous Welsh Levantine?\\u2019 he asked. A suffragi went by carrying two sherry glasses on a silver tray. Paul intercepted him. \\u2018Which for you?\\u2019 he asked Owen. \\u2018Pale or medium?\\u2019 \\u2018Pale.\\u2019 \\u2018I feel pale. You can have the medium.\\u2019 \\u2018Would the effendi prefer sweet?\\u2019 asked the suffragi. \\u2018No, thanks. The world isn't very sweet just at the moment.\\u2019 The Consul-General's agents, fresh from England, might not have been prepared to agree with him. There was a near-Indian opulence about the proceedings. The light from the heavy gilt chandelier overhead sparkled on the silverware: little ornate Persian boxes of sweets and cigarettes, huge Arabesque trays of silver and bronze, the filigree of dainty caskets, the solider work of massive fruit bowls, the trays of the turbanned, red-sashed suffragis gliding round with drinks. The reception was being held in the main hall of the Residency. The marble floor was already crowded with guests. Knots of expatriates had gathered around each visitor, eager for news from England. Senior Egyptians from the Ministries talked quietly among themselves. Practised diplomats from the embassies circulated among the groups. Normally Paul would have been circulating with the best of them, oiling the wheels. The moment Owen had come in, however, he had waylaid him and taken him off behind the potted palms. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018if it's not you, it's serious.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm glad you put it like that,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Garvin put it the other way: if it was me, there'd be trouble.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, that too,\\u2019 said Paul, waving a hand dismissively. \\u2018But you're right. It \\u2013s serious. It's bound to get out now. I've stopped it this time but it will come out somewhere else. In one of the illegal papers. The point is, they've spotted it. And once that has happened, it's only a matter of time.\\u2019 A group began to form on the other side of the potted palms. A tall Egyptian looked over, saw Paul and waved his hand. Paul waved back. A short, plump man in tails peered round the edge of the plants. \\u2018My God!\\u2019 he said. \\u2018he Mamur Zapt! Plotting as usual.\\u2019 \\u2018But not against you this time, Charg\\u00e9,\\u2019 said Owen in French. \\u2018We stand shoulder to shoulder.\\u2019 \\u2018It's my back I'm worried about,\\u2019 said the Charg\\u00e9. \\u2018Come and see me some time. Come to dinner. Bring Zeinab.\\u2019 \\u2018I will, tomorrow,\\u2019 Owen promised. The Charg\\u00e9 waved a hand and turned back into the group. Paul drew Owen a little further away. \\u2018That's another problem,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018What?\\u2019 \\u2018Zeinab.\\u2019 \\u2018Forget Zeinab.\\u2019 What are we going to do about this mess?\\u2019 \\u2018I can suppress if for a time. I can garble it when it comes out. I can camouflage it with other things. But in the end it will come out.\\u2019 \\u2018How long's the end?\\u2019 \\u2018Two weeks, perhaps three. Two days if we're unlucky.\\u2019 \\u2018The Agreement will take at least another month.\\u2019 \\u2018Why don't we just disown Narouz? We and the Khedive?\\u2019 \\u2018It is Narouz, is it?\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 wen admitted, \\u2018we can't be completely certain.\\u2019 \\u2018We can hardly disown him publicly, then.\\u2019 \\u2018I wasn't thinking of going as far as that. I was just thinking that if the case were unblocked \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Gareth,\\u2019 said Paul, \\u2018are you absolutely certain that you didn't plant the story yourself?\\u2019 \\u2018Absolutely certain. I would have remembered a thing like that.\\u2019 \\u2018It's just amazingly convenient.\\u2019 \\u2018It seems so, I know. But actually,\\u2019 said Owen,'I find it rather worrying. You see, up to now we've been able to keep it fairly tight. But this means it may be moving out of our control. Once people get hold of a thing like this they can start using it.\\u2019 \\u2018So?\\u2019 \\u2018It needs to be wrapped up quickly. We want to get it out of the way before it starts escalating. Let Mahmoud get on with it. If it is Narouz, and the Khedive is bothered, we can tell Narouz to get out of the country quick. If it's not, we can finish it off without too many questions being asked. But we've got to move fast.\\u2019 \\u2018This haste,\\u2019 said Paul, \\u2018it's not anything to do with Zeinab, is it?\\u2019 \\u2018Certainly not,\\u2019 said Owen. Zeinab kissed him. \\u2018I knew you would find a way,\\u2019 she said. Owen kissed her back: then said, \\u2018Actually, it's not me.\\u2019 Zeinab pushed him away. \\u2018What do you mean: it's not Owen reluctantly let her go. \\u2018It's someone else. Nothing to do with me.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't understand,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Someone else leaked it. Or else found it out. They gave it to Al-Liwa.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not in Al-Liwa. I was reading it this morning.\\u2019 \\u2018I know. I cut it out.\\u2019 \\u2018You cut it out? Then\\u2026?\\u2019 \\u2018I just used it. Privately.\\u2019 Zeinab couldn't make it out. However, she was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018at least that's something.\\u2019 \\u2018The effect is the same. The case is unblocked. Mahmoud can get on with it. So why don't we \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Not so fast,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018You haven't done anything yet.\\u2019 \\u2018I've unblocked the case, haven't I?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't think that counts.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, come on \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018No. That's not enough. I want Leila avenged.\\u2019 \\u2018Avenged! Look, at the most all I could do was bring whoever did it to trial.\\u2019 \\u2018As long as they die,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018I don't mind about the means.\\u2019 \\u2018I can't do that!\\u2019 \\u2018If you can't,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018I won't.\\u2019 And wouldn't be moved. Owen went off in a huff and read the papers. Zeinab curled up on a divan, deliberately provocatively, thought Owen, and ate Turkish Delight. After a while Owen said: \\u2018There's something you could do to help.\\u2019 \\u2018I might be prepared to do that,\\u2019 conceded Zeinab, dusting the powder from her fingers. \\u2018What did you have in mind?\\u2019 A call came from Prince Narouz. \\u2018He's got the message quick,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018He wants you to see him,\\u2019 said Nikos. The Prince was waiting for him on the terrace of the Hotel Continental, sitting by himself and looking bored. His eyes lit up when he saw Owen. \\u2018My dear fellow!\\u2019 He waved him up. \\u2018A drink? Whisky, perhaps?\\u2019 He was having one himself. It was another of those things, like the green car, which made him a less than perfect Moslem. It would also, Owen thought, make him a less than perfect candidate for Khedive when a vacancy arose. Perhaps the British should back off him. He sat down at the table and looked over the balustrade at the Street of the Camel below. It was the Regent Street of Cairo; except that in Regent Street you would not see a man walking by with a stuffed crocodile on his head or a pig being carried by in a cage. What you would see, of course, were tourists and there were plenty of these. They came down the steps of the hotel with their Kodaks \\u2014 at the Continental there was always a large number of Americans \\u2014 and were immediately fallen upon by dragomans, donkey-boys and street-traders of all  kinds, all offering instant picturesqueness without the trouble of having to go too far in the heat to find it. \\u2018Have you noticed,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018that their business has changed? They used to sell beads and hippopotamus-hide whips and boa-constrictors. Now they sell themselves to be photographed. That man, for instance\\u2014\\u2019 he pointed to the one with the stuffed crocodile on his head \\u2014\\u2018he does not expect to actually sell the damned thing. Who would want to buy a stuffed crocodile? But a photograph, ah, well, that's a different thing. The tourist can carry it home much more conveniently; and the crocodile remains to be used another day.\\u2019 The Prince sipped his whisky. \\u2018From the point of view of trade it is an improvement. But to my mind it's got the thing the wrong way round. The really exotic thing is the camera. And for that \\u2014\\u2019 he looked around with distaste \\u2014\\u2018you don't need to come to Egypt.\\u2019 \\u2018There are, after all, other places.\\u2019 \\u2018True; and I wish I were in them.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah well, you may be able to escape soon,\\u2019 said Owen, saying the thing he thought he was being invited to say. \\u2018You think so? Well, I hope you are right. This family business goes on and on.\\u2019 The waiter brought Owen a whisky packed with ice, and a little pewter jug of water, also iced. Even in the best hotels they tended to view whisky as a kind of pastis and served it for drinking in the French way. \\u2018And how, my dear fellow, are you getting on with your case?\\u2019 asked the Prince. \\u2018Oh,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018it moves, like all these things, in fits and starts. At the moment, I would say, it was starting again.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, good,\\u2019 said the Prince. He looked, however, troubled. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018I think it will soon be picking up momentum.\\u2019 \\u2018Excellent,\\u2019 said the Prince, fidgeting with his glass. \\u2018We'll soon be getting somewhere.\\u2019 The Prince swirled the ice in the bottom of his glass and inspected it. He was about to speak and then thought better of it. Owen smiled encouragingly and waited. \\u2018I would like to help,\\u2019 said the Prince suddenly. \\u2018I have been thinking over your suggestion the other day. Perhaps I was too hasty in rejecting it.\\u2019 \\u2018About the money?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes. I said then that it was a matter for the Government. But then, looking at it another way, I am, loosely speaking, the Government. In the old days, in a case like this, you would have appealed directly to the Khedive, not gone through layers of stupid bureaucracy. You were absolutely right to come direct to me. Right and proper.\\u2019 \\u2018Ye-es?\\u2019 This was not quite what Owen had expected. \\u2018And it was wrong of me to reject it out of hand. I was not being true,\\u2019 said the Prince, looking at him earnestly, \\u2018to my responsibilities.\\u2019 \\u2018No?\\u2019 said Owen, a little taken aback. \\u2018No. You see, I was relieved. I thought it might all be going to go away without me having to do anything. That it might all blow over without any unpleasantness \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Unpleasantness?\\u2019 \\u2018Publicity.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes. Of course.\\u2019 \\u2018A woman dead.\\u2019 The Prince waved a hand. \\u2018Sad. But what's a woman dead in Egypt?\\u2019 \\u2018Quite.\\u2019 \\u2018So,\\u2019 said the Prince, \\u2018I thought I would let it all blow over.\\u2019 \\u2018Mm.\\u2019 Owen sounded disapproving. \\u2018You're right. It wouldn't do. I couldn't do it. Not when it came to it. Well, it's not too late to put things right.\\u2019 \\u2018Put things right?\\u2019 \\u2018You can have the money, my dear fellow. Count on me.\\u2019 Owen was dumbfounded. What was this? He had been half expecting a confession. Not an offer of help! Wait a minute: was this quite what it seemed? Was it a genuine offer? Or did the Prince expect something in return? \\u2018I am most grateful, Your Highness,\\u2019 he said cautiously. \\u2018Indeed, I am overwhelmed. But, um, the money will go to redeeming the body, you know.\\u2019 \\u2018Of course,\\u2019 said the Prince, surprised. \\u2018What else? Oh, I see. Well, no. Not this time.\\u2019 \\u2018In that case I can only express my gratitude. I will get in touch with Mr el Zaki immediately.\\u2019 The Prince regarded him thoughtfully. \\u2018I know what you think,\\u2019 he said suddenly. \\u2018You think I did it. Killed the girl. Well, I didn't. Indeed not.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not sure that we need his money,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018Well, ordinarily I wouldn't pay that sort of price \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018I think we can do without it.\\u2019 Mahmoud, Owen knew, did not like paying money for information. It smacked too much of the Old Egypt of bribes and favours which he wanted to sweep away. Trained in the French school of severe deductive logic, he preferred to rely on unassisted reason. Assemble your knowledge and analyse it: that was the way forward. Not haphazard reliance on rumour and gossip. He was different from Owen. Owen purchased information every day. He had his agents out in the bazaars and souks and offered a steady price for good information. He had inherited when he became Mamur Zapt a vast network of spies, informers and paid agents which dated back to his Ottoman predecessors and which the British saw no reason to disturb. It was the difference between a detective and an Intelligence Officer. Even in India, where Owen had served before he came to Egypt, and where in his latter years he had been seconded from his regiment to an Intelligence post  on the Frontier, it had been normal practice to purchase information. He found Mahmoud curiously puritanical. \\u2018The fact is,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018I don't think we need it.\\u2019 \\u2018How else are we going to find the body now that those buggers have pinched it?\\u2019 demanded Owen. Mahmoud frowned. Owen thought for a moment that he was taking exception to the casual obscenity, but it was not that. He was bothered by \\u2018pinch\\u2019. Mahmoud's knowledge of English, as of French, was superb but army colloquial occasionally threw him. \\u2018Stolen,\\u2019 Owen amended. \\u2018Ah yes, \\u2018pinch\\u2019,\\u2019 murmured Mahmoud, filing the word away for future reference. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I think I have found out who did \\u2014 pinch?\\u2014 it.\\u2019 \\u2018You've found the body?\\u2019 said Owen incredulously. \\u2018No, not yet,\\u2019 Mahmoud admitted. \\u2018But I have, I think, found the men. And that is where, my friend \\u2014\\u2019 he placed his arm affectionately round Owen in the Arab way \\u2014\\u2018I need your help. For I do not think they will talk to me, not without encouragement. The Parquet, you see, is something new to them and the police they view with derision.\\u2019 \\u2018New?\\u2019 said Owen. The Parquet had existed, he thought, since at least 1883 when a reforming Minister of Justice had unearthed in his office some Arabic translations of parts of the French Code Napoleon and promulgated them as the new Egyptian legal system. \\u2018New to them,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, urging Owen towards an arabeah drawn up beside the pavement. \\u2018Whereas the Mamur Zapt,\\u2019 he said, as they settled back into the shabby, hot leather, \\u2018is old. They are used to him. And they know,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, smiling, \\u2018that he is even more merciless than \\u2014 well, wait and see.\\u2019 \\u2018Look,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018I'm not \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018All you have to do is just sit there,\\u2019 Mahmoud reassured him. \\u2018The name will be enough.\\u2019 \\u2018Who are these people?\\u2019 They were, Mahmoud explained, the beggars who normally worked the part of the river where Leila's body had come ashore. \\u2018They all have their territory,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018It was just a case of finding who they were.\\u2019 That had not been difficult since they were, in fact, known to all the neighbourhood. The boatmen knew them, the watchman knew them \\u2014 he greeted them every day \\u2014 and the police certainly knew them. Mahmoud had had, however, some good fortune. He had remembered having seen, that first day, some goats grazing further on down the river bank, had made some inquiries and discovered that they were taken down on to the river bed every morning by a boy who acted as herd. He had found the boy and questioned him. Yes, he had taken the goats down that particular morning. No, he had not seen a body, still less a woman's body. If he had, he might have gone out and had a look. But he did remember seeing the two beggars. Their names were Farag and Libab and he saw them every day. They worked the bank where his goats grazed and they would always stop and have a chat. He remembered that day because Farag had asked him if he had a sister. He did have a sister but he thought that, poor though his family was, it would not be very keen on her marrying a beggar. Where was the profit in that? He had pointed that out to Farag but Farag had not been put off. He had said that things might be going to change. The boy had scoffed at this but Farag had told him to wait and see. He was still waiting. It would have been, he said, late in the morning when the men were coming back. They worked outward from the city to a point not far south of the Souk al-Gadira and then returned, thus making two sweeps of the river bank. They made caches on their way out which they picked up as they returned. \\u2018What do they make caches of?\\u2019 asked Owen. \\u2018Wood, mostly.\\u2019 Wood was in short supply in the city. It was the main fuel used for large-scale cooking and faggots were brought into the city every day. It had to come from some distance away since over the centuries the trees and bushes on both sides of the river had been lopped down. Driftwood, then, fetched a not inconsiderable price. So there was evidence that the beggars had been on the bank that morning. And there was the additional point that on their return they had appeared cheerful, as if from a windfall. They were being held at the local police station. The Chief had resigned himself to Mahmoud but had not been expecting Owen. When he saw him he flinched slightly. His doom still hung over him like a sword. The two beggars were crouched in the courtyard. One affected to be lame and had probably become so by constant practice. The other affected blindness and certainly had something wrong with his eyes, though half the population of Egypt suffered from ophthalmia and the eyes couldn't have been too bad since he relied on them every day. Mahmoud, sitting behind the Chief's desk to better express the awful power of the state, had them brought in. Owen sat behind the two men, back in a corner. They did not see him as they came in. \\u2018You are Farag,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018and you are Libab?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 \\u2018And you patrol the bank every day and what you find you take back to the Man?\\u2019 The beggars hesitated. \\u2018We patrol the bank, yes.\\u2019 It was best not to use the name of the Man. Mahmoud had established, though, that he knew him. \\u2018Think back,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018think back to the morning when you asked the boy Farakat about his sister. What had  happened that morning to make you think, Farag, that you were rich enough to afford a wife?\\u2019 \\u2018It was idle talk,\\u2019 said Farag. \\u2018I do not remember.\\u2019 \\u2018I think you do remember,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018but you do not want to tell me. And that is foolish. Foolish because I may know the answer already and just be testing you. Foolish because if you do not tell me, I have the power to take you away from the river bank, away from the sun and light, and shut you in the caracol for ever.\\u2019 \\u2018At least it would be cool there,\\u2019 said Farag sturdily. \\u2018And they would give us food,\\u2019 said Libab. \\u2018Every day,\\u2019 said Farag. \\u2018I have heard.\\u2019 The whole population had heard. An unexpected side effect of Cromer's reform of the prison system was to make conditions inside prison better for the poor than they often were outside. \\u2018For ever,\\u2019 repeated Mahmoud, significantly but untruthfully. That was another change. In the old days a man could be left to languish in prison uncharged and forgotten. Nowadays his case had to be heard within a given time. The beggars were not impressed. They felt they might be on to a good thing. Indeed, the more they reflected on it, the better it appeared, and they quickly passed from affecting forgetfulness to unaffected obduracy. There had been nothing out of the ordinary about that morning, they said, nothing. \\u2018You did not find something on the river bank that you thought had made your fortune?\\u2019 \\u2018That would have just been a dream,\\u2019 said Libab. \\u2018Yet you, Farag, believed the dream was real enough for you to fancy you were rich,\\u2019 Mahmoud pointed out. \\u2018That was mere fancy,\\u2019 said Farag. Mahmoud could not break through. He sat silent for a moment, thinking. The beggars, emboldened, became cheeky. \\u2018You can't do anything to us,\\u2019 said Libab. \\u2018Let us go!\\u2019 \\u2018What if we did find something on the bank?\\u2019 asked Farag. \\u2018What is that to you?\\u2019 \\u2018Little to me,\\u2019 Mahmoud admitted. He had made up his mind how to play the next bit now. \\u2018But a lot to the Mamur Zapt.\\u2019 \\u2018The Mamur Zapt? What's he got to do with it?\\u2019 \\u2018You're just dragging him in,\\u2019 said Farag. \\u2018The Mamur Zapt is not interested in the likes of us.\\u2019 \\u2018On the contrary,\\u2019 said Owen from behind them. \\u2018I find you very interesting.\\u2019 The men froze. Mahmoud came round the desk and sat on the front of it. \\u2018There you are,\\u2019 he said amiably. \\u2018What did I tell you?\\u2019 Farag tried to look over his shoulder. Mahmoud reached forward, took him by the head and turned his face back towards him. \\u2018You are talking to me. Would you like me to take them through it?\\u2019 he asked Owen over their shoulders. \\u2018Please do.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, then. Let us begin with what you found on the river bank.\\u2019 \\u2018We found nothing on the river bank,\\u2019 said Farag, still sturdily but less confidently. \\u2018The girl's body. As you came along the bank, where was it lying?\\u2019 \\u2018We saw no girl's body.\\u2019 \\u2018On the shoal. A little out from the bank. As I said, perhaps I know the answers already. Tell me what you did when you saw the body.\\u2019 \\u2018We saw no \\u2014\\u2019 began Farag, and stopped. \\u2018The Mamur Zapt is beginning to get impatient,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018And I don't think I will help you any more.\\u2019 \\u2018We saw the body,\\u2019 whispered Libab. \\u2018And I said to Farag, \\u2018There it is.\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018So!\\u2019 Mahmoud nodded approvingly. He turned to Farag. \\u2018And what did you say?\\u2019 \\u2018I said,\\u2019 replied Farag reluctantly, \\u2018I said: \\u2018Perhaps it is not. Perhaps it is another. Let us go and see.\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018So you walked out to the shoal and \\u2014?\\u2019 \\u2018We saw that it was the body.\\u2019 \\u2018How did you know that it was the right body?\\u2019 \\u2018By the dress,\\u2019 whispered Libab. \\u2018The shintiyan?\\u2019 He caught their look of surprise. \\u2018As I told you. I know everything. They were pink, I think?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, effendi.\\u2019 Libab, at any rate, was docile now. \\u2018It wasn't just the shintiyan,\\u2019 said Farag, caving into line. \\u2018Oh? What was it?\\u2019 \\u2018It wasn't a peasant woman, you see. Most of the ones that come down are.\\u2019 \\u2018You knew she wouldn't be?\\u2019 \\u2018That's right.\\u2019 \\u2018You had been told?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Who by?\\u2019 Farag hesitated. \\u2018You know,\\u2019 he muttered. \\u2018The Man?\\u2019 Libab looked involuntarily over his shoulder, half saw Owen and was transfixed. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud chattily. \\u2018It is difficult, isn't it? The Mamur Zapt stands on one side of you, the Man on the other. I would watch my step if I were you. So you had found that you had been told to find. What then?\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Farag, \\u2018we saw the ghaffir coming. So we ran away and hid.\\u2019 \\u2018We thought he might not see the body,\\u2019 said Libab. \\u2018But he did. He went down on to the bank and looked at it. And then he looked around to find someone he could send to the omda. But there was no one.\\u2019 \\u2018We stayed hid.\\u2019 \\u2018He had to go himself.\\u2019 \\u2018Then Farag said to me: \\u2018Let us take the body now, before he comes back.\\u2019 So we ran into the water and took the body.\\u2019 \\u2018What did you do with the body?\\u2019 \\u2018Carried it behind the wall.\\u2019 \\u2018It was as far as we could get,\\u2019 explained Farag, \\u2018because then the ghaffir came back.\\u2019 \\u2018But first the policeman came with his pole. That was good, wasn't it?\\u2019 \\u2018He didn't know what to make of it.\\u2019 \\u2018We laughed. Farag laughed so loudly I thought they would hear us.\\u2019 \\u2018Because then the ghaffir came back and he was even more amazed.\\u2019 \\u2018And then the Englishman came down \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018And that was a good laugh too, I expect,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Yes, it was,\\u2019 said Libab enthusiastically. \\u2018There they were, all three of them, scratching their heads and wondering where the body was \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018And all the time it was behind the wall. Right nearby!\\u2019 \\u2018Very funny,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018And how long did it stay behind the wall?\\u2019 \\u2018Until they were all gone. A lot of people came down. You were there yourself, weren't you?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018I was.\\u2019 Their merriment died away. \\u2018Well, yes,\\u2019 said Farag. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 echoed Libab faintly. \\u2018Yes. So what did you do then? With the body?\\u2019 \\u2018We hid it.\\u2019 \\u2018Where?\\u2019 \\u2018Under a boat. There's a boatman along the bank. He does things for the Man sometimes. We went to him and said: \\u2018We have hidden something for the Man under one of your boats.\\u2019 And the boatman said: \\u2018Tell me which boat it is so that I will know which boat not to look under.\\u2019 And  we told him. And he said: \\u2018I will see that it stays there until the Man sends someone for it.\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018Show me the boat,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. They showed him the boat. But when he lifted the upturned boat and peered into the hollow beneath it he found nothing there. CHAPTER 8 \\u2018So the Man has it,\\u2019 said Owen. They were walking home along the river bank. The sudden, brief Egyptian twilight had come upon them while they were looking at the boat. One moment the sun had been hanging above the desert, the next it had plunged out of sight, leaving only the copper and rose and saffron of the water to testify that it had been there. As the shadows closed over the land the heat went out of the day. A delicate river breeze sprang up. Mahmoud and Owen looked at each other, then with one accord started walking. The beggars had been sent to the caracol. All the information they possessed had probably been got out of them, but if they were released they would simply disappear. They might even, as Mahmoud pointed out, disappear for good. \\u2018More than that,\\u2019 said Mahmoud. \\u2018He not only has it but he sent them to fetch it.\\u2019 \\u2018So he knew it would be there.\\u2019 \\u2018And that,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018takes us back to what happened on the dahabeeyah that night.\\u2019 \\u2018And rules out one thing: that she fell overboard by accident.\\u2019 \\u2018Or jumped of her own accord.\\u2019 \\u2018He knew the body would be there. He knew it beforehand. Which makes it \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018I would think so.\\u2019 As darkness fell, the birds began their evensong. There were not many trees in the poorer part of the city but the few trees there were, preserved to give shade in the little squares, were full of birds. From the topmost branches where the pigeons sat came a continuous cooing. \\u2018He must have had somebody on the boat,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018It looks like it.\\u2019 \\u2018Who killed her and threw the body overboard.\\u2019 \\u2018Don't we have difficulties there?\\u2019 asked Mahmoud. \\u2018Surely if it was thrown overboard there was no guarantee that it would finish up on shore where the Man could send someone to fetch it. It could just as easily have gone on to Bulak bridge. Or beyond, for that matter.\\u2019 \\u2018How far off-shore was the dahabeeyah?\\u2019 \\u2018Not far. It was moored for the night.\\u2019 \\u2018Could the body have been dumped straight on to the shoal?\\u2019 \\u2018They would have had to have taken it ashore.\\u2019 \\u2018A rowing boat, perhaps?\\u2019 \\u2018Surely someone on board would have seen it?\\u2019 \\u2018Perhaps they were looking the other way.\\u2019 \\u2018Deliberately, you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018They might have been told to.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Owen thoughtfully, \\u2018it would figure. The body was high up on the shoal, wasn't it? We wondered how it had got there. We thought it might be a bow wave from a steamer.\\u2019 \\u2018So we did. Yes,\\u2019 said Mahmoud, \\u2018that would figure.\\u2019 \\u2018So we're going to have to deal,\\u2019 concluded Owen. Garvin looked dubious. \\u2018It's a lot of money.\\u2019 \\u2018It's pretty definite that he's got the body. And if we want it, that's what we've got to pay.\\u2019 \\u2018Do we want the body?\\u2019 asked Garvin. \\u2018That much?\\u2019 \\u2018How else are we going to find out how she was killed?\\u2019 'It's a lot of money.\\u2019 \\u2018It would need a supplementary allocation. I'm over the top on that budget as it is.\\u2019 Garvin pursed his lips. \\u2018I put in for a supplementary allocation only last week,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018They'll say, \\u2018What, another?\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2018Well, I can't see any other way of doing it.\\u2019 \\u2018I can just see them,\\u2019 said Garvin, \\u2018when I go along. \\u2018Please can I have a supplementary allocation.\\u2019 \\u2018What another?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, it's to buy a body, you see.\\u2019 It would look bad on paper, Owen. These accounts go back to London. There are MPs who crawl over everything we do. They'd spot it and say, \\u2018What the hell is this?\\u2019 They'd think it was the Mahdi's skull all over again.\\u2019 The Mahdi's skull had been a cause c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre. At the conclusion of the Sudan wars, shortly before, the victorious British general, Kitchener, had smashed the tomb of the defeated enemy and claimed his skull as a souvenir. It had been alleged in London, possibly truthfully, that he had intended to make a drinking tankard of it. \\u2018Well, how else am I going to find the money? Narouz has said he'll help but in the circumstances \\u2014\\u2019 Garvin looked at him quickly. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018In the circumstances. You really think \\u2014?\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Owen, \\u2018it looks like it.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't like it,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018This is going to look bad. It could be very awkward. We don't want it turning up just when \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018We're not there yet,\\u2019 said Owen defensively. \\u2018Suppose it comes up just when we're about to sign the Agreement? It could blow the whole thing. You're supposed to be keeping it under control, Owen. What the hell are you doing?\\u2019 \\u2018Look, I'm not \\u2014\\u2019 Owen began but decided it was a waste of time. \\u2018What about this money?\\u2019 he asked. \\u2018Don't like it,\\u2019 said Garvin. \\u2018It would look bad in the Accounts. \\u2018Item: one body. Purchased for the Mamur Zapt. Private use of.\\u2019 No,\\u2019 said Garvin, shaking his head, \\u2018it wouldn't look good at all. I really don't think I could support a bid for a supplementary allocation. Not in the circumstances.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm afraid not,\\u2019 said Prince Narouz, shaking his head regretfully. \\u2018Not in the circumstances.\\u2019 \\u2018But only two days ago \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Circumstances have changed.\\u2019 \\u2018In two days?\\u2019 \\u2018Things are very fluid just at the moment.\\u2019 They were sitting again on the terrace at the Continental. The sun was still bright and the Prince was wearing huge, dark-green sun-glasses. The tables were filling up for afternoon tea. A party of French tourists arrived from the bazaars and made their way up the steps. One of them was a strikingly beautiful woman in her mid-thirties. The dark-green glasses followed her progress indoors. \\u2018Why have they changed?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, well,\\u2019 said the Prince vaguely. \\u2018You know.\\u2019 \\u2018The Agreement?\\u2019 \\u2018That, too.\\u2019 \\u2018It's near signing?\\u2019 \\u2018They think so,\\u2019 said the Prince caustically. \\u2018Personally, I don't believe my uncle will be able to bring himself to do it when the moment actually comes. The prospect of having the British here for another twenty years! Frightful!\\u2019 The Prince looked at Owen, laughed archly and placed a placating hand on Owen's. \\u2018Or so my uncle will think. Of course, I myself see it differently. I would be only too delighted if the British were to remain.\\u2019 And had, no doubt, been communicating that fact very successfully, thought Owen bitterly. \\u2018A breath of Western air, my dear fellow,\\u2019 said the Prince. \\u2018That's what Egypt needs. Cars, bridges, roads, factories: we need to step through into the modern age.\\u2019 With plenty of contracts for British firms. The Prince, thought Owen, knew how to play his hand. \\u2018So you have changed your mind,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Oh, I wouldn't say that!\\u2019 the Prince protested. \\u2018No, no, my dear fellow, I am still eager to help. You can count on me, believe me. But things are \\u2014 delicate, just at the moment. Let's not rush. More haste, less speed. Although \\u2014\\u2019 the Prince turned reflective \\u2014\\u2018speaking as a driver, that is a phrase I have always found puzzling.\\u2019 \\u2018The offer might not remain open.\\u2019 \\u2018You think so?\\u2019 The Prince looked at him thoughtfully. \\u2018You think so?\\u2019 \\u2018There might be others.\\u2019 The Prince turned it over. Turned it over thoughtfully. \\u2018I can see there is a risk. However \\u2014\\u2019 he smiled charmingly \\u2014\\u2018it is a risk I am prepared to run.\\u2019 \\u2018So you won't help after all?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm afraid not. Not just now. Not in the circumstances.\\u2019 Owen could see it all. The Prince, once again, had scented the possibility of wriggling off the hook. The British had refused to buy the body. Why should he stick his own neck into the noose? If he didn't find the money, perhaps no one would find the money. The body would remain where it was. What did it matter if there was a leak in the Press? They wouldn't be able to prove anything. Why not just leave things alone? And meanwhile cast a little bread upon the waters. A hint here, a hint there. A suggestion that the Khedive was not perhaps entirely dependable. A reminder of his own Western sympathies. An intimation of trade concessions, contracts for British firms. No wonder, thought Owen bitterly, that Garvin had backed off. There would be no deal with the Man, that was plain. Unless \\u2014 Owen stopped in his tracks. Unless Narouz made one of his own. Owen sat cursing himself. What folly! What utter folly! To go to the one man in the world most interested in seeing that the evidence never came out and then to put into his hands the means of ensuring that it never could come out! How had he come to do a thing like that? He knew what had put the idea in his head. It had been that first visit to the police station, when the Prince had dangled money in front of the local chief. He had been prepared to put his money down then. Why not, Owen had thought, get him to put his money down later, when it could really do some good. When he had gone to him, the Prince had in fact at first turned the suggestion down. It hadn't really bothered Owen, it had just been something to try. But then when Narouz had himself raised it and indicated that he had changed his mind, it had suddenly come to seem a good idea. Perhaps Narouz had even then been playing a game with him. Perhaps even then he had no real intention of finding the money for the body, or at least not of presenting Owen with it. But, looking back on the conversation, Owen did not think so. The offer had seemed genuine. Something had been troubling Narouz. It might simply have been the fear of publicity. Owen had a feeling, though, that it was something else. Narouz had spoken of family worries. Whatever it was, Narouz had switched again. But this time there was a difference. He now knew almost for certain that the British were not prepared to find the money. That meant the way was now open for him to strike a private deal. And he, Owen, had given him the information! What a fool! What an idiot! What could he do now? Nothing, as far as he could see. Narouz had the information. All he had to do was strike a bargain. And once he'd got the body, that was that. He would dispose of it and a key item of evidence would be gone for good. It was all very well Mahmoud saying they didn't need the body. In theory that might be true. If the other evidence was good enough they could secure a conviction on that alone. But could they ever secure a conviction on that basis against an heir to the throne? He would be defended not just by the best lawyers in Egypt but probably by the best lawyers in France. The case would have to be watertight. And without incontrovertible evidence that Leila was dead, would it ever be watertight enough? It wouldn't even get to prosecution. The whole weight of the State would be ganged up against it. The Khedive, the Minister of Justice, the Parquet, the British \\u2014 the British would be against it, too, particularly if this damned Agreement was still on the cards. It wouldn't have a chance, in the circumstances, of even reaching the courts. In the circumstances. That was what they had both said. Both Garvin and Narouz. Now he was saying the same thing. It was what anyone would say, anyone used to politics or business or the world of affairs generally. When you had been in that world for a while you knew the way things would go. So? What was he saying? Was he saying that when you knew the way things would go, you went along with them? Wasn't that being defeatist? Well, no, not really. It was being sensible, it was being realistic. If you were involved in things at a senior level, whether it were as an administrator, a Minister or even as a senior policeman, you had hundreds of things on the go at any one time. And if you knew that pushing one particular thing was going to get you nowhere you didn't waste time going on pushing it, you left off and started pushing  something else. That way you got something done, at any rate. So did that mean he ought to forget about Leila? That was what Garvin was more or less saying, that was what, he suspected, Paul would say. What it boiled down to was a question of priorities. A set of priorities went with the job and if you took on the job you took on the priorities. His priorities were pretty plain. The Mamur Zapt was in charge of law and order in Cairo and that meant keeping the city quiet and stopping them all from getting at each other 's throats. And in the circumstances that was pretty difficult and \\u2014 In the circumstances. There he was again. Zeinab had said something about that. She had said he was too much a man of circumstances, that when the circumstances changed, he changed. Well, she would say that, wouldn't she? It was easier for a woman. A woman's world was more private, she was in charge of it in a way that you couldn't be if you were a man. In a man's world you were forever running up against things. Yes, you were more interested by circumstances. They kept bloody coming up and hitting you in the face. He couldn't ignore circumstances. They were part of his world, they were his world. And he liked his world, damn it! So what was he going to do about Leila? If anything. Zeinab announced that she was taking Owen to the theatre. \\u2018Not another New Roses, is it?\\u2019 asked Owen suspiciously. \\u2018It is by Gamal, as it happens,\\u2019 said Zeinab haughtily. \\u2018At least, the translation is by him. The original play is by an Englishman, though what Gamal is doing translating plays by Englishmen I cannot think. It is called Love's Labour's Lost.\\u2019 \\u2018Love's Labour's Lost? But that's by Shakespeare.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know anything about that,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018But I thought from the title that it might have something special  to say to you. That is not the only reason why we are going, however.\\u2019 \\u2018No?\\u2019 \\u2018You remember you asked me to see if I could find out who it was that had sent that news item about Leila in to Al-Liwa.\\u2019 \\u2018If you could do it discreetly, yes.\\u2019 \\u2018Naturally. Well, I talked to Gamal's journalist friends. Most of them work on the arts pages and don't know much about the rest of the paper. But one of them is a copy-editor, I think that is what he is called, and he told me that he thought the item had come in from a friend of Leila's.\\u2019 \\u2018Did he know his name?\\u2019 \\u2018He wasn't sure. He thought he had seen him, though, at Gamal's soirees. He had usually been with a girl, an Arab girl, which was unusual, of course, and had made him stand out.\\u2019 \\u2018Leila?\\u2019 \\u2018Probably. Anyway, he saw him again in the office at Al-Liwa just before the item appeared. Or would have appeared if you had not crossed it out. So he thinks perhaps it came from him.\\u2019 \\u2018Could he check?\\u2019 \\u2018No. He says you don't check things like that at a radical paper like Al-Liwa.\\u2019 \\u2018Fair enough. It would be useful to have the bloke's name, that's all.\\u2019 \\u2018Well \\u2014\\u2019 said Zeinab, looking smug. \\u2018Well, what?\\u2019 \\u2018I had an idea. Do you remember that when we were talking to Gamal and his friends they mentioned some of the men that Leila had gone around with?\\u2019 \\u2018Suleiman.\\u2019 \\u2018And others. Well, one of them \\u2014 you remember?\\u2014 was a journalist.\\u2019 \\u2018So he was. But I don't remember \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Hargazy. That was his name. Anyway, I checked. And \\u2014\\u2019 Zeinab paused dramatically. \\u2018Yes?\\u2019 \\u2018He works for Al-Liwa.\\u2019 \\u2018Does he now? Does he now?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Zeinab, pleased with the effect. \\u2018Not all the time. He is not on their permanent staff \\u2014 they don't have many permanent staff, of course, because you put them in prison \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018No, I don't. Al-Liwa doesn't make any money, that's why they don't have many permanent staff.\\u2019 \\u2018Anyway. Hargazy just does the occasional article for them. He covers demonstrations, that sort of thing, Gamal's friend said.\\u2019 \\u2018I'll take a look at him.\\u2019 \\u2018We'll take a look at him. That is why we are going to the theatre. I've asked Gamal to invite him specially. And, just to be sure, I've asked Gamal's friend, the one who works in Al-Liwa, to be there too.\\u2019 \\u2018My God!\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Anything else?\\u2019 \\u2018Not at the moment,\\u2019 said Zeinab. Owen kissed her. That much, at least, she allowed. The Arab Theatre was a barn-like building which on its better days could seat an audience of two hundred. This was not one of its better days. The Arab predilection for drama, at least in personal relationships, did not extend to a taste for Shakespeare's comedies translated into Arabic, and the house was less than half full. The first three rows, seated in rather tatty red plush armchairs, were occupied by Gamal's friends and supporters and were respectable, at least in terms of numbers. It was on the wooden benches behind that the gaps appeared. They were, in fact, mostly gap. Behind them was a row of flimsily-partitioned wooden boxes. Half of them, the ones with wooden grilles, were for  the women. The others were for the nass taibin, the really well-to-do. This presented a problem for Zeinab, who was quite definitely a woman but didn't like to sit invisible and fenced off from her friends. She was, however, also well-to-do, so she compromised by sitting in the open box next to the screened harem ones. She was, though, the only woman doing this and attracted pointings-out and mutterings, not to say ribaldry. She had made a gesture in the direction of decency by wearing a veil, behind which she sat disdainfully. She was, nevertheless, not entirely comfortable. Gamal and one or two of his friends had joined them in the box and Gamal was not entirely comfortable either, though for different reasons. \\u2018They are not laughing,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018This is terrible!\\u2019 \\u2018They are enjoying it quietly,\\u2019 said Owen soothingly. \\u2018Yes, but \\u2014 are they not seeing the jokes? Haven't I brought them out sufficiently?\\u2019 \\u2018It's not always easy to get the jokes. Even in the English.\\u2019 \\u2018I should have brought them out more.\\u2019 \\u2018That's not so easy. So many of them are based on wordplay, puns.\\u2019 \\u2018But you see, that's why I chose the play. Arabic has a tradition of word-play, too. I thought I would bring out the affinity between Elizabethan English and classical Arabic.\\u2019 \\u2018You have,\\u2019 Owen assured him, \\u2018you have!\\u2019 Zeinab followed the play with interest. \\u2018I like that bit,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018When she sends him away to make jokes in a hospital. \\u2018To move wild laughter in the throat of death.\\u2019 Yes, I like that.\\u2019 \\u2018I agree with him,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Twelve months is too long.\\u2019 \\u2018What I don't like,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018is having men play the women's parts.\\u2019 \\u2018You have to do that,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018It's unseemly to have women on stage.\\u2019 \\u2018I've seen women on stage here,\\u2019 Owen objected. \\u2018Ah yes. Foreign women. And sometimes we have Jews. But not Arab women, that wouldn't be right.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not right to have boys,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018not when it's a question of making love.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not making love,\\u2019 said Gamal. \\u2018It's talking love.\\u2019 \\u2018There's something to be said for that,\\u2019 said Zeinab, with a sidelong glance at Owen. \\u2018In England in Shakespeare's time,\\u2019 said Owen, disregarding her, \\u2018the women's parts would probably have been played by boys.\\u2019 \\u2018I am against confusion on a matter like this,\\u2019 said Zeinab. Fortunately, some of Gamal's friends burst into the box at this point. \\u2018Brilliant, Gamal! Exquisite!\\u2019 \\u2018The wit!\\u2019 \\u2018You think so?\\u2019 said Gamal? pleased. \\u2018I was worried \\u2014\\u2019 They bore him off to their favourite cafe. Owen and Zeinab tailed along. Zeinab was talking to a tall, thin youth who seemed rather overwhelmed by her presence. \\u2018You're sure?\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the youth, shyly but firmly. Zeinab dropped back alongside Owen. \\u2018This is Hafiz. He works on Al-Liwa.\\u2019 \\u2018A paper I always read,\\u2019 said Owen truthfully. \\u2018Really?\\u2019 said the young man, gratified. \\u2018I've only just started there. They don't let me do much yet. Copy-editing, that sort of thing.\\u2019 \\u2018They have a very small staff. You've done extraordinarily well to get on to it at all.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the young man modestly, \\u2018I suppose I had quite a reputation. I used to edit a radical student newspaper. Sword of Islam. I don't suppose\\u2026?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes,\\u2019 said Owen, again truthfully. \\u2018I have read it.\\u2019 He read all the radical papers. \\u2018Excellent,\\u2019 he assured the young man. \\u2018I am sure you have a considerable career ahead of you.\\u2019 \\u2018I was asking Hafiz,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018if Hargazy was the one who came to the office.\\u2019 \\u2018Which is Hargazy?\\u2019 Zeinab pointed out a balding man in an open-necked red shirt. \\u2018And was he?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said Hafiz. When they reached the cafe, Zeinab drew up a chair beside Hargazy. He responded to her at once. Most people did. \\u2018I don't think we've met?\\u2019 \\u2018Although I've certainly seen you,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018You must be one of the few friends of Gamal that I don't know.\\u2019 \\u2018I know Feisal better than I know Gamal. He brings me along,\\u2019 said Hargazy, smiling, \\u2018to occasions like this.\\u2019 They talked about the play. \\u2018You obviously know a lot about writing,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018I should,\\u2019 said Hargazy. \\u2018That's how I earn my living.\\u2019 \\u2018Really? A playwright? Or perhaps a novelist?\\u2019 \\u2018Not yet,\\u2019 admitted Hargazy, a trifle grudgingly. \\u2018I've got one or two things coming along. Rather good things, actually. But at the moment I'm still freelancing.\\u2019 He told her he contributed to Al-Liwa. \\u2018That's a real paper,\\u2019 said Zeinab enthusiastically. \\u2018I wish I could work for it.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Hargazy, laughing, \\u2018I'm afraid that's out of the question. A woman, after all \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018Women do write,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018In France they write.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, in France.\\u2019 Hargazy shrugged his shoulders. \\u2018I haw seen you before,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018And wasn't it with a girl? An Arab girl? I remember, because it was so unusual. What was her name?\\u2019 \\u2018Leila.\\u2019 He looked at her a little warily. \\u2018That's right. How is she? Or shouldn't I ask?\\u2019 The man didn't reply. He looked down at the ground. \\u2018I'm sorry,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018Perhaps you've split up?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Hargazy, \\u2018no.\\u2019 \\u2018She looked an interesting girl. I had a sort of fellow feeling for her.\\u2019 \\u2018Really?\\u2019 Hargazy looked at her sharply. \\u2018Why should you have a fellow-feeling for her?\\u2019 Now it was Zeinab who shrugged. \\u2018I don't know,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Nothing, really. It was just that she was another Egyptian girl. Among so many foreign ones.\\u2019 \\u2018That was it,\\u2019 said Hargazy. \\u2018That was what made her stand out.\\u2019 \\u2018I shouldn't ask about her,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018I'm sorry.\\u2019 \\u2018No, not at all. It's good to ask about her.\\u2019 \\u2018No, it's not,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018I remember now: she is dead.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018she is dead.\\u2019 He looked down at the ground, then looked up. \\u2018They killed her,\\u2019 he said. '\\u2019 They\\u2019?\\u2019 \\u2018The ones who kill us every day.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't understand,\\u2019 said Zeinab. \\u2018You must understand,\\u2019 said the man. He waved an arm excitedly. \\u2018The ones who hold us down. Stamp on us. Destroy what is best of Egypt.\\u2019 \\u2018The British?\\u2019 \\u2018They are just the tools,\\u2019 said Hargazy contemptuously. \\u2018If it wasn't them it would be the Turks. Or the French. No, it's the ones who bring them in, who brought them in in the first place \\u2014\\u2019 \\u2018The Khedive?\\u2019 \\u2018And the rich. The whole pack of them. They are like a great yoke sitting on our shoulders. They weight us down, they rob us, they starve us. They beat us \\u2014\\u2019 His shoulders heaved. \\u2018They beat me,\\u2019 he said in a strangled voice. \\u2018When I was a boy. The Pasha's overseer struck my father. I said: \\u2018Do not do that.\\u2019 He said, \\u2018I will teach you to talk to me  like that.\\u2019 And then he beat me, and my father watched \\u2014 and did nothing!\\u2019 His voice choked. \\u2018It was then I realized: he could do nothing. Nothing, while all those people were in place. Nothing, while they were the ones who held the curbash.\\u2019 Zeinab, that daughter of a Pasha and representative of the rich, sat silent. \\u2018They kill us,\\u2019 said the man bitterly. \\u2018And they killed Leila.\\u2019 \\u2018If they killed Leila,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018then that should be made known.\\u2019 The man looked at her sharply and seemed about to speak. Then he thought better of it. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Yes.\\u2019 \\u2018If you need help,\\u2019 said Zeinab, \\u2018call on me.\\u2019 There was, said Nikos, a deputation waiting to see him. \\u2018Show them in,\\u2019 instructed Owen. \\u2018I can't. They won't fit in.\\u2019 \\u2018How many of them are there?\\u2019 \\u2018Sixty,\\u2019 said Nikos. \\u2018So far.\\u2019 Owen had been conscious for some time of growing movement in the courtyard below. He went to the window and pushed open the shutters. The courtyard was full. \\u2018I revise my estimate,\\u2019 said Nikos. \\u2018Eighty.\\u2019 \\u2018What do they want?\\u2019 \\u2018It's something to do with bodies,\\u2019 said Nikos. Owen went down into the courtyard. A little group of men were standing by the door waiting for him. Their faces seemed half-familiar. Georgiades suddenly appeared beside him. \\u2018Marwash,\\u2019 he said, indicating one of the half-familiar faces. \\u2018He's the father of the girl.\\u2019 \\u2018Girl?\\u2019 \\u2018The one whose tomb they used to put the arms in.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes.\\u2019 He recognized some of the faces now. There was the village omda and there was the local sheikh. And there was the fiki who had gone to the tomb with the women to chant the readings. Georgiades, for some reason, was looking at him closely. \\u2018Haven't I seen you before?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You saw me at the tomb,\\u2019 replied the man. \\u2018Somewhere else too.\\u2019 The sheikh came towards Owen. He was a religious sheikh and presided at the mosque the girl's father attended. They exchanged the prescribed greetings. \\u2018A sad business,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018My heart goes out to the father and to all the family. Those responsible will be caught and punished.\\u2019 It was a serious matter to profane a tomb. Apart from the distress it caused, there was the affront to religious susceptibilities. The authorities were always prompt to support the Mufti and the religious sheikhs on a thing like this. It could so easily spill over into civil disorder and violence. \\u2018So they should be,\\u2019 said the sheikh. \\u2018Ali Marwash is greatly respected. However, that is not the reason why I have come to see you.\\u2019 \\u2018No?\\u2019 Owen looked round. The courtyard was now overflowing with serious-faced, white-galabeahed men. There were others outside the gates. Outside the gates, too, he could see some respectably dressed women. It was unusual for women to appear at such a public occasion. Policemen, armed, filed out of the building and took up position. He signed to them to keep back. \\u2018Your troubles are my troubles,\\u2019 he said to the sheikh. \\u2018What can I do to help you?\\u2019 \\u2018It is the girl's body,\\u2019 said the sheikh. \\u2018That it should be disturbed in this way is most regrettable.\\u2019 \\u2018It is not there.\\u2019 \\u2018Not there?\\u2019 said Owen, dumbfounded. \\u2018It is not in the tomb.\\u2019 Surely his men had not removed the body with the guns? \\u2018When we looked, it was not there.\\u2019 \\u2018How can this be?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know,\\u2019 said the sheikh, \\u2018but these are evil times.\\u2019 \\u2018Has search been made?\\u2019 \\u2018Where should search be made?\\u2019 Perhaps the arms-runners had removed the body finding there was not enough room for the arms. But then, where would they have put it? \\u2018The Place of Tombs,\\u2019 said Owen. \\u2018Perhaps it has been cast aside.\\u2019 \\u2018We have looked,\\u2019 said the sheikh, \\u2018but we could not find it. And so we have come to you.\\u2019 \\u2018It is wrong,\\u2019 said one of the men beside him, \\u2018wrong to trouble the dead.\\u2019 There was a murmur of assent from the crowd. \\u2018Cannot a body be left to rest in peace?\\u2019 asked someone else. The mutter grew louder. Beyond the gates a woman began to ululate. \\u2018Who can have done this evil thing?\\u2019 \\u2018Not one of us,\\u2019 someone shouted from the back of the crowd. \\u2018No,\\u2019 the fiki called back, \\u2018it was some unbeliever, I'll be bound!\\u2019 \\u2018Shut up!\\u2019 snapped Owen. \\u2018Shut up!\\u2019 said Georgiades, pressing the fiki back against the wall. He peered in the man's face. \\u2018Haven't I seen you before?\\u2019 There were shouts now from all sides. Some men at the back of the crowd tried to force their way forward. The crowd surged alarmingly. The policemen fingered their rifles. \\u2018Enough!\\u2019 Owen stepped forward and held up his hand. \\u2018Enough! This wrong will be righted. But that is for the Mamur Zapt and not for you. Go back to the Place of Tombs. My men will come with you. We will search together until the body is found and restored to its rightful place.\\u2019 This was well received but no one actually moved. Owen pushed his way into the crowd. \\u2018I will lead you!\\u2019 he shouted. The crowd opened up and he headed for the gate. The sheikh fell in behind him. \\u2018To the Place of Tombs!\\u2019 shouted Georgiades, thrusting with his shoulders. The constables joined in enthusiastically. Gradually the crowd began to move. Outside the gates they fell into a more or less orderly procession, Owen at their head. When they got to the Place of Tombs he would find a way of breaking them up. If they could find the body, that would be fine. He would assure them that the perpetrators would be punished and they would all go home happily. It should not be too difficult to find the body. It must have been dumped somewhere nearby. When he looked in the tomb he had not really noticed the body was missing. He had seen the arms and thought that was that. He had presumed the body was somewhere in the background. God! Another body going missing! He'd thought for a moment that the fates had it in for him. But this, surely, was straightforward. He hoped.\",\n          \"IN CHINATOWN, the streets were narrower, cluttered with produce stalls \\u2014 open even this late \\u2014 and mysterious tents. I had an idea I could hide out there for a while, maybe rest up, maybe make a connection who could get me out of the City. The cops would be watching the bus station and the railroad terminal, but maybe I could bribe my way aboard a tramp steamer for Macao or Shanghai. I knew that I had money. Some of the Genie of the Bank had attached to my clothing. In an alley beside the Keye Luke Cabana, under a string of apparently waterproof paper lanterns, I peeled the bills off my trench coat and pants. I had forty or fifty thousand in hundreds. The bills weren't sequentially numbered or marked in any of the large variety of ways I could imagine. I wadded one into my shoulder holster as an ace in the hole, packing it down with the gun. Then I made a fist-sized roll of the rest and shoved it into my deepest pocket. You were never entirely safe from prying fingers in Chinatown, but I had to give it my best shot. A wolfpack of ragged children swarmed through the streets, snatching at whatever was insufficiently guarded. The merchants occasionally killed one, but that didn't seem discouragement enough; there were always new recruits. \\u2018Tell you fortune, Mist' Americano, tell you fortune.\\u2019 A decrepit old man, supported by a young boy in a huge coolie hat, was tapping his way down the alley, patterned robes trailing in the rainwater. His face and hands were white and very wrinkled, but any signs of extreme age stopped just below his jawline and just above his wrists. He had huge empty eye sockets wadded with cotton, a scraggly Fu Manchu moustache  and a long grey pigtail. A sign hung around his neck, covered with a scrawl of ideographs and a single attempted English word, BLIDN. I had the idea he was a European in disguise. His withered claw reached out and attached itself to my lapel. \\u2018Tell you fortune,\\u2019 he jabbered. \\u2018Fortune velly good. China girl in bathhouse wait you. She miss you velly much a long time. Much money in stars belonging you. Much good is fortune. Much.\\u2019 I shoved a hundred into his hand to get rid of him. He held the bill to his ear and slid it between his fingers. In his grin, several teeth were blacked. He shook with excitement. I realized my mistake; he'd remember such generosity, and his boy would be able to describe me. Hell, under all that gook on his eyelids, he was probably no blinder than a hawk. That made two unwanted witnesses to point the finger at me. \\u2018Much thanking, Mist' Americano, much thanking.\\u2019 He whispered a long coil of Chinese phrases to his boy helper, and the child looked up at me, almond eyes shining in a brim-shadowed face. The hat nodded up and down in gratitude. A rattling commotion alerted me to the patrol well before it reached the alley. I shrank back while the fortune teller tottered towards the main street. Merchants folded their stalls and made a run for it, their goods wrapped in voluminous sleeves. A grey guava rolled to my feet. I picked it up and bit deeply. It tasted dry, like pasteboard, but it was food and I couldn't remember the last time I had eaten. With what I hoped was an air of raffish nonchalance, I sauntered to the mouth of the alley, munching on the increasingly inedible fruit. A battered Model T Ford, mounted with a shining machine gun, flying an unrecognisable flag, was lumbering down the street, pushing people and stalls before it. \\u2014 A Chinese officer in a uniform more than adequately equipped with polished belts, straps and full holsters stood up in the front passenger seat of the car like George Washington crossing the Delaware, shouting dictatorially. A tethered goat went down under one iron-rimmed wheel, and the vehicle jolted as the animal was crushed. The officer steadied himself by grasping the windshield, but didn't miss a beat in his spiel. Three glum soldiers sat in the back of the car, greedily eyeing the machine gun, while a very fat civilian in a dragon-decorated garment did the driving. The car finally ground to a halt against the remains of  a silk stall, a knot of scarves caught around one axle. The officer belaboured the driver about the head with a pair of white gloves, and stepped down to the street. A turbanned, one-legged beggar raised his bowl to him, and he knocked it out of his hands. Small children scrambled for the scattered coins before they washed down the drains. The officer picked up the beggar by his neck. The missing leg dropped down and kicked, and the officer threw the con man away, chattering at him in some dialect. He drew one of his several revolvers and fired a shot in the air. The fake beggar ran off, turban unspooling from his head as he made pretty good time for someone unused to having two legs under him. I stayed back in the shadows. The patrol probably wasn't looking for me \\u2014 there were too many fugitives in Chinatown to concentrate on just one \\u2014 but they'd be more than willing to take me in if they tripped over me. The officer barked an order, and the soldiers jumped into action. They grabbed the blind fortune teller and flung him brutally against the wall of a josh-house. One soldier held up his head, and clawed at his face. He showed a handful of greasepaint and rubber to the officer, who strode over and asked a question. The fortune teller, half his moustache still attached, shook his head, and with a single shot the officer summarily executed him. The dead man fell backwards, his head cracking against the lap of a stone buddha. I threw away the guava core, and it too was torn to pieces by the children. A small form whipped past me into the alley and tried to squeeze between my back and the wall I was leaning against. It was the fortune teller's boy. I turned to push him away, and his hat slipped between us. Long black hair tumbled from the top of the boy's head. He was a girl, with a lovely oval face. Anna May Wong. She looked up at me in silent supplication. I knew I should throw her to the patrol and make my own getaway, but she appealed to the chink in my armour. Widows, orphans, lost children, small dogs. They all get me into trouble. I never learn. I took her in my arms and we kissed. She was very enthusiastic. I held her by her wrists to keep her delicate fingers out of my pockets. I lost track of what was going on outside the alley until the officer tapped her shoulder with his revolver and waved it in my face. She let my mouth go and pressed the length of her body against my side. The officer smiled unpleasantly, silver teeth shining. There was more decoration on his cap than on  the average gypsy caravan, and he had a pair of samurai swords strung criss-cross on his back. \\u2018Papers, please?\\u2019 I made the pretence of patting my pockets and looking like a total cretin. \\u2018I'm so sorry, General Yen, I seem to have left them at my hotel. I'm sure you'll understand.\\u2019 \\u2018That is most unfortunate,\\u2019 he said in Oxford-accented English. \\u2018We hate to detain our most welcome guests, especially when they have\\u2026\\u2019 he looked Anna May up and down as if his mind could do with a good Chinese laundering \\u2018\\u2026other urgent business to attend to.\\u2019 The soldiers were getting impatient. Obviously, if they didn't shoot someone every ten minutes they got on edge. \\u2018Hold on a minute,\\u2019 I said, \\u2018there's one pocket I haven't tried. \\u2019 I fished out my bankroll. \\u2018Ah yes, here are my papers.\\u2019 I peeled off five hundreds and gave them to the officer. \\u2018I hope they're in order.\\u2019 \\u2018Most certainly. An internationally accepted passport. Excellent. May I see your driver's licence?\\u2019 I handed him another five bills. \\u2018Work permit?\\u2019 More money. \\u2018Birth certificate?\\u2019 Not much left now. \\u2018Draft notice?\\u2019 \\u2018Here.\\u2019 I gave him the rest of it. \\u2018This is my Eagle Scout badge, and some baseball cards. That's my lot.\\u2019 \\u2018Excellent. That is all in order.\\u2019 He wadded the money up tight and shoved it into one of the pouches on his Sam Browne belt. \\u2018You may go on your way now, Mr\\u2026?\\u2019 \\u2018Doe. John Doe.\\u2019 \\u2018Mr Doe. The good wishes of Buddha go with you.\\u2019 He turned away and addressed his men in Chinese. Then, to me, \\u2018Have a pleasant evening.\\u2019 He climbed back into his car, and hit his driver again. The fat boy had unwound the scarves. \\u2018He told them to wait a minute and shoot us down,\\u2019 Anna May whispered into my ear, \\u2018like dogs.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, really,\\u2019 I told her. \\u2018Thank you, darling.\\u2019 I signalled to the least intelligent-seeming of the soldiers. \\u2018Excuse me, do you have a cigarette?\\u2019 He shook his head. I made smoking gestures, and walked over towards them. \\u2018Cigarettes?\\u2019 I said, puffing furiously at empty air and flicking an imaginary lighter. The dime dropped, and one of them grinned, tucked his riffle under his arm and reached into his uniform. I grabbed his wrist and broke it, spinning him round and holding him up. I heard the guns go off. Luckily, my shield was heavily built. The bullets didn't go through him. I heaved him at the other two and they went down, firing wild into the air. If they had had pistols, they'd have been able to get a better aim. The officer, in his car, was well out of range for an accurate shot with his cheap revolver. Still, he came a lot closer than I had expected. I dived behind a handcart and came up with my automatic in my hand. I wasn't any better at this kind of messy shoot-out than they were, but I put a hole or two in the car's windscreen, and put one of the soldiers out for the count. Then the sidewalk three yards to the left of me started exploding, and an earthquake line of stone chips advanced towards the cart. The noise of the machine gun was deafening. I pushed myself back out of the line of fire as the wooden cart splintered into an abstract sculpture. Little darts stuck into my legs from the knee down. I fired in the general direction of the officer's head, and missed. I saw him grinning ferally as he worked the gun with both hands, spent cartridges flying into the air. He was jitterbugging with the recoil, and the gun's momentum kept his first sweep going for a couple of yards even after he realised he'd missed me. He swung the gun upwards on his mount and was obviously set to cut me in half with his next pass when the knifehilt appeared in his chest, lodged deep between two bandoliers. He staggered back, brushing at the black stains seeping from his wound, and fell off her car. His uniform would be ruined. The surviving soldier gaped and, in the sudden silence, I shot near his head. He ran off. I looked back at the alley. The girl was there, waving sweetly. Her topcoat was open, and I saw the belt of knives \\u2014 with one missing \\u2014 strung from shoulder to waist. Why hadn't I felt them when we were pressed together? Perhaps she only had them when she needed them. Anna May buttoned her coat and scampered away, swarming like a monkey over the wall at the back of the alley and vanishing into the night. By the time  I got to the officer, the children had practically stripped him. His swords were gone, and his boots, hat, revolvers and belts. My money was gone too, of course. And the girl's throwing knife. Two urchins were struggling to detach the machine gun from its mount. One six-year-old Our Gang refugee stood solemnly by the car, too-long pants concertinaed around his feet, holding up the officer's revolver in both hands, covering the fat driver. The machine gun came free, and the children staggered off under the weight, certain of a huge price on the black market. The junior gunman ran off after them. The fat driver giggled, then burst into full laughter, the rolls under his robes quivering like jellies. His egg-shaped body shook with his mirth, and the Model T rocked from side to side. He slapped his enormous thighs and laughed some more. I left him there, and headed for the next block. \\u2018Mist' Americano\\u2026\\u2019 The voice was feeble, cracked and fluttering. It came from the fortune teller. I couldn't see how he could be alive, but I went to him. His face was a mess, with a black bullethole and a tangle of rubber. His wrinkled nose had come off, and one smooth caucasian cheek showed through his withered Chinese mask. \\u2018Mr Tunney,\\u2019 he gasped \\u2014 mistaking me for someone else? as he reached for me with a flailing hand. \\u2018Mr Tunney, don't forget who you are. It's important. Mr\\u2026\\u2019 He fell back onto the Buddha, dead again. Tunney. The name meant something to me. It was as familiar almost as my own, but I couldn't pin a face to it. I had a few nagging associations, a snatch of a song (\\u2018Beautiful Dreamer\\u2019), a girl's name (Lissa), and a big white room like hospital ward. The driver was still laughing. Chinatown was too hot even for me. I swore I'd never go back. Eight THE BARD was striding along the Boulevard, cloak wrapped tight against the rain, iron-tipped stick striking sparks from the sidewalk. He had woken from his walking death a while before, in the middle of a quote from Coriolanus. It was his habit to patrol the streets of the City, declaiming the Gospel according to Shakespeare to passers-by, emoting his way through the great speeches in the hope of earning a few drinks. In his time, he had been a poet, a preacher, a cowhand, a scientist, an adventurer, a hobo. Now he was the Bard of the Boulevard. He was known in every bar and diner in town, and tolerated in most. Like everyone in the City, he had been as one dead. His creator had fashioned him from clockwork and set him to go through the motions of living without giving him the actual breath of life. He had followed his script, fulfilled his stereotyped purpose, but never really acted of his own accord. He had been one of the supporting players of the City, a Harmless Eccentric. \\u2018He wants nothing of a God but eternity and a Heaven to throne in,\\u2019 he shouted at Gail Russell, frightening the girl off the street. Good job too, a young thing like her oughtn't to be out late on a pestilential night like this. It struck him like fire, and the scales were lifted from his eyes. Surrounded by enslaved automatons, he was a free man. For the first time, he felt \\u2014 really felt-the rain in his face, the weight of his stick, the pull of his waterlogged cloak. He stopped reciting, he stopped walking. He nearly stopped breathing. Given unexpected control of his lungs, he spluttered and drew breaths until his body took over. He bent double, hugging his thin chest inside his cloak, then drew himself up to his full height. His heart beat, and his wet hands ached. It came to him as a Revelation, descending upon his mind in all its complex glory, that there was a man in the City in need of his help, and that the man \\u2014 his name didn't matter-would free everyone as this awakening had freed him. In an instant he had decided. He would find this man, help this man. The City would be free, whether it wanted to be or not. With an added purpose in his step, he continued on his way, returning to Coriolanus with renewed vigour. Above him, in the night, eyes t, winkled. Nine THELMA RITTER, the woman behind the counter in Kelly's, looked at me sideways when I paid for doughnuts and coffee with a wet hundred-dollar bill. But she still made change. On the jukebox, the Ink Spots were crooning \\u2018Don't Get Around Much Any More.\\u2019 The song reminded me of my ex-wife, only the group were trying for wistful melancholy and my associations were screaming nightmare. \\u2018How d'you like your java?\\u2019 Thelma asked, a Brooklyn croak in her voice. \\u2018As it comes.\\u2019 She sloshed coffee into an uncracked cup and disinterred two doughnuts from their sugared resting place under glass. I sipped the black brew, my body tense, waiting for the tug at my arm. Flashing that kind of money in this kind of joint could lead to either of two things, a uniformed policeman or a chippie. The doughnuts were okay, and the coffee helped with the fog in my brain. I bought a pack of cigarettes \\u2014 the brand an indistinguishable smear- and lit one up. Outside in the street, a few cars cruised. From my stool, I'd be able to see anyone coming into the diner. I prayed that Kelly's wasn't a popular cop hang-out. For a few minutes, I was almost at peace. I sort of nodded into a half-sleep sitting up at the counter. The idea of a bed was appealing. I rolled it around my mind, imagining pillows rejected by princesses as too soft, a closetload of blankets, silk sheets, an acre or more of mattress\\u2026 I snapped awake, and looked down at my fish-eye-lens reflection in the coffee. I was beat, but I couldn't risk a motel or even a flophouse. Word was  out on me. I shouldn't be in Kelly's. But it was warm here, and there was soothing music. I had some puzzles to think out. Who really killed Truro Daine? What did this man Tunney \\u2014 I knew Tunney was a man \\u2014 have to do with the case? He must look like me. That kind of  doppelg\\u00e4nger effect was common in the City. And why was I having this trouble with people? I had noticed it several times since I left the Monogram Building. I felt as if I were moving just a beat faster than everyone else. I could tell what people were going to do or say \\u2014 trivial things like lighting a cigarette or commenting on the rain, important things like committing murder or founding a dynasty \\u2014 and it disturbed me. I felt that I had seen this movie before. Thelma, haggard and overly lipsticked, gave me a refill. I drank again, scalding my throat to shock me awake. \\u2018Mister\\u2026\\u2019 I supposed I was lucky. It was a chippie, not a cop. Natural, really. Statistics show that there are more women in the world than anything, except insects. I half turned on the stool. She was a blonde in a black dress, wearing a tiny hat with a visor of veil. The dress was tight in the right places, and shiny where it shouldn't have been. She was going to ask me for money, I thought. \\u2018Mister. Do you have a dime for the jukebox?\\u2019 Knowing I'd regret it, I gave her a handful. \\u2018Thanks, mister.\\u2019 She had a high voice, almost squeaky like Mickey Mouse's. \\u2018My name's Glory. Gloria, that is. Gloria Grahame. Look at my monogram.\\u2019 She dangled a handkerchief from her glove; black, embroidered with white letters. \\u2018G.G. Like a horse. Gee-gee, get it?\\u2019 She laughed, an artificial, almost grating squeal. I liked her. \\u2018Richard.\\u2019 I held out a hand, and she pinched it with tiny, black-gloved fingers. The hamburger-flipper at the other end of the joint looked unhappily at us. He must get his heart dented every hour on the hour. Just like me. He adjusted his paper hat and turned back to his stove. The door opened, and someone came in from the night. I was expecting death in a uniform, but it was just Frank McHugh, a beef-faced truck driver in a cloth cap. He went into some  comedy patter, bouncing lines off Thelma. I could afford to miss that part of the picture, and turned back to Gloria. She had a cigarette \\u2014 one of mine, I realised \\u2014 in her mouth, and was waiting, expectantly. She coughed a little. \\u2018I'm sorry.\\u2019 I took my lighter out, and she held my hand again, tighter this time, guiding the flame. She sucked, and the cigarette end glowed. She gave me my hand back, but let her velveted fingers play with it for a second or two. She smiled, showing off her plump, tight little mouth, and blew a failed smoke ring. She didn't make a move for the jukebox, but the coins had disappeared. \\u2018You have an interesting face, mister.\\u2019 \\u2018It's been around.\\u2019 \\u2018Yeahhh. Around.\\u2019 Her fingers touched my face, feeling for the painful spots. She found them. \\u2018You look like you've had a rough night.\\u2019 \\u2018You could say that.\\u2019 \\u2018Cops?\\u2019 \\u2018Priests. Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald got me drunk and stole my wallet. Then Ingrid Bergman knocked me around, just for the fun of it. I guess I should have paid attention in Sunday school.\\u2019 She looked hurt. \\u2018No need to fun me, mister. I was just concerned.\\u2019 She tried very, very hard not to say \\u2018concoined\\u2019 and only just missed. \\u2018Us night people gotta look out for each other.\\u2019 \\u2018Night people?\\u2019 \\u2018Yeah. You're a night person, like me. I can tell. There were two Irish boys in here earlier, in uniform, back from the war.\\u2019 She tried hard to remember, and I realised she was a touch drunk. \\u2018Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. Imagine, two friends with the same name. They had the look you do, the night-person look. I asked them about the war, and they said it was okay, but you could see in their eyes they didn't mean it. Lots of day people go to the war and come back night people. Like this kid who used to come here \\u2014 I think I was married to him once \\u2014 Dick Powell. He started as a day person, and was in all these big spectacular musical shows they used to put on. They don't do them any more. You know the kind, with thousands  of girls dressed as bananas; now, they just put thousands of bananas on one girl. Dick was the dayest person you ever saw, shining hair, big smile, dimples, high tenor voice. Well, the war came, and Dick turned into a night person, got a job as a private cop or a night editor or something. Now he shaves every other evening, carries a gun and doesn't sing no more. Me, I've been a night person longer than I can remember.\\u2019 \\u2018How do you get to be a day person?\\u2019 \\u2018You don't. It only works the other way round. You know, like you only grow older. You have to live with it.\\u2019 She smiled, slyly this time, and leaned forwards. Her dress shifted a little, exposing an inch or two of cleavage. \\u2018There are ways night people have a better time, Richard. There are compensations.\\u2019 Her eyelashes fluttered, and she stubbed out her cigarette on my empty plate. \\u2018I live two blocks from here, in a walk-up,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018It's late.\\u2019 I looked up at the clock. It was half past two. I looked down at Gloria. She raised one delicately plucked eyebrow. We understood each other. In her walk-up, there would be a bed. Just now, that was the best way to get to me. Money, threats, drugs: they wouldn't work. A bed, now, that was irresistible. For eight hours' sleep, I'd knock off God and hang the frame on Jesus. \\u2018Can I walk you home?\\u2019 \\u2018Would you?\\u2019 She tossed her head, for the benefit of the hamburger chef. \\u2018I'd be honoured. You don't often get to meet a gentleman these nights. Not with the war.\\u2019 The chef mashed a lump of raw gristle on his stove, and kept it down until it was half charcoal. \\u2018Good night, Glory,\\u2019 he said, flipping the thing over and blacking the other side. She sniffed the air and ignored him. She took my arm, fingers digging through several layers of clothing, as if reaching for the bone. As we walked towards the doors, she rested her head on my shoulder. The doors opened and three men came in. Gloria stepped back behind me, recognising them. The youngest, a dead-eyed thug with prematurely white hair, gave a shark smile. \\u2018Hello, Gloria, going so soon?\\u2019 \\u2018Lee\\u2026 I thought you was playing poker tonight.\\u2019 I heard a tremble in her voice, and again had that impending violence feeling. I recognised these three too. I had seen pictures. White hair was Lee Marvin, twenty-eight arrests, no  convictions. He was high up in the syndicate, which tied him in to Truro Daine. The other two were small fish, Jack Elam and Neville Brand, but they could have argued over first and second place in an Ugly Contest. I gathered my presence was breaking up a beautiful picture of Lee and Gloria. Not exactly a wedding photograph, but close. I had seen enough pain and blood for one night. I saw Thelma clearing the counter of anything breakable. By the door, Frank McHugh comically gulped down the last of his coffee and hurried back to his rig, leaving half a plate of bacon and scrambled eggs on the table. Jack Elam shut the doors behind him and turned the OPEN sign round to CLOSED. \\u2018Please, boys,\\u2019 said the chef, \\u2018I don't want no troubles.\\u2019 \\u2018No trouble at all, Kelly.\\u2019 Marvin grinned. I made fists in my pockets. He had some poundage on me, and he wasn't as tired as I was. Plus he'd brought King Kong's illegitimate children with him. I was going to get beaten to a pulp. Again. It was becoming monotonous. \\u2018Coffee, Duchess\\u2026\\u2019 Thelma picked a full jug off the hotplate and brought out some cups. Before she could pour, Lee took the coffee away from her. It bubbled and steamed like corrosive acid. God knows what it would do to the inside of anyone's stomach. Or the outside of anyone's face. \\u2018Who's the pretty boy, Gloria? i \\u2018I\\u2026 I just met him, Lee. He was gonna see me home, protect me. It's late.\\u2019 That had been the wrong thing to say. Marvin's mouth went thin, and his grip on the handle of the pot got very tight. He flipped the lid open and shut with his thumb. It looked like a hungry carnivorous plant. The coffee smelled like burning oil. It might have been brewed this year, but I doubted it. \\u2018What're you going to do, tough guy,\\u2019 I asked, \\u2018steam the paint off a battleship?\\u2019 The door swung in again, bumping Jack Elam. A tall, gaunt, cloaked man swept in, long limbs scissoring with his stride. \\u2018What country, friends, is this?\\u2019 he boomed, shaking every piece of crockery in the place. \\u2018Bring me liquid sustenance, for I have need of thy strongest mocha-java, merchantman\\u2026\\u2019 Marvin gaped, turning to look at the newcomer. Drunk or crazy, the tall man had made an entrance worthy of Henry  Irving. He swept past Neville Brand, sideswiping him with his cape, reaching out with a heavy walking stick. \\u2018Such is the stuff the dreams of my palate are made on, Kelly, thine is the most potent brew, renowned throughout this fair land.\\u2019 The ferrule of his stick touched the glass coffee pot and shattered it. Marvin shrieked like a gutshot coyote as the dark, boiling liquid soaked through the front of his shirt and trousers, staining black his belly, groin and upper thighs. He threw away the useless handle, collapsed on the linoleum and started scrabbling at his clothes with pawlike hands. He let out a torrent of the vilest abuse imaginable. \\u2018Darn! Heck! You dumb duck\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2013A thousand \\u2018pologies, mon brave.\\u2019 The tall man doffed his floppy hat and bowed low, waving his hand like a courtier. \\u2018Twas but an accident. Certes, my lord, I have the gelt to replace yon coffee pot. Permit me to purchase you all a fresh beverage as a token of my humblement.\\u2019 Marvin could hardly stand up. I could imagine his agony. Underneath his suit, he must be glowing like a fresh-cooked lobster. The thought made me feel warm inside. Elam and Brand helped him up. \\u2018Get me to a doc,\\u2019 he gasped. \\u2018I gotta know. It feels bad, real bad.\\u2019 \\u2018You touch my heart, sieur,\\u2019 said the tall man, stepping forwards to offer his hand and accidentally standing on Marvin's toes. \\u2018Oh, vile, intolerable, not to be endured! What a zany I am! It seems I cannot perform one task aright this eventide.\\u2019 \\u2018Why, you\\u2026 Gloria, help get me to Blair Hospital\\u2026 I'll deal with this clown some other time.\\u2019 Sheepishly, Gloria crept out from behind me. \\u2018Sorry,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I gotta go. Thanks, mister. I don't want trouble. Good night;\\u2019 She kissed me on the cheek, and followed the three out to the street. Her stocking seams weren't straight. \\u2018Parting is such sweet, sad sorrow, my young friend. Steel your heart, gird up your vitals and content yourself with the company of bold fellows like Kelly and myself\\u2026\\u2019 The tall man swung his hat up again and latched it onto his head. He had shoulder-length hair and a black Buffalo Bill moustache. \\u2018John Carradine,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018at your service. They call me the Bard of the Boulevard on cause of my devotion to the immortal works of Master Will Shakespeare. Ho, master greybeard loon,\\u2019 he was shouting to Kelly, \\u2018come fill the cup, or stap me for a whey-faced knave.\\u2019 He thumped the counter with a thin, knuckly hand, and Thelma found another coffee pot from somewhere. \\u2018See, where she comes apparelled like the spring. A princess fair, the whiteness of whose skin would shame th\\u2019 Arctic snows to a blush, the brightness of whose hair would provoke fabl'd Helen to a fit of the envious humours\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018Stow it, motormouth,\\u2019 she said, smiling sheepishly, \\u2018and drink your coffee.\\u2019 Thelma poured two cups, spilling a bit. I could swear I saw it sizzle as it ate through the varnish. Carradine dropped a few coins \\u2014 ducats, I think \\u2014 into the puddle and waved the woman away. She grunted and went back to her pile of glamour magazines. On the cover of Fortune, a day person was smiling, displaying star-bright teeth. I took a stool next to Carradine, and downed the coffee. One way or another, I had drunk quite a bit this evening, but I didn't need to powder my nose. None of the places I had been in seemed to have a men's room anyway. Carradine clapped me around the shoulders. \\u2018We are well met, comrade-in-arms. Long have I combed the vilest quarters of this town on fruitless search for thee. From wharf to palazzo I have quested, 'countering gallants and monstrosities. My trusty sword\\u2026\\u2019 he tapped his stick \\u2018\\u2026has been gored gules twice its length in wanton combat. O, who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty Caucasus? Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast, Kelly, eggs over easy s'il vous plait!\\u2019 \\u2018You've been looking for me?\\u2019 \\u2018Indeed, coz. Thou'rt famed as the slayer of the Devil's prime minister, Master Quick.\\u2019 \\u2018Daine.\\u2019 \\u2018The very same. Would that 't were mine, the hand that separated the tyrant's head from the residue of his perfidious corse!\\u2019 Thelma gave us both a refill, shaking her head. Kelly produced a plateful of what passed as eggs, and Carradine launched into them with a fork. \\u2018I'm afraid I didn't kill Daine.\\u2019 \\u2018No matter. The noble intent was there. That lifts you as hero above the commonality. My fealty always is sworn to thee.\\u2019 \\u2018Wait a minute. You didn't like Daine?\\u2019 Carradine spat eloquently. \\u2018I thought he was loved in the city, like a king or something.\\u2019 \\u2018Garbage wrapped in silk is still garbage and stinks as such, my friend. I've long since pledged my sword to any who would help rid this borough of the damned Daine. Some \\u2014 too few have tried. Youngman Bogart, for one, Glenn Ford for another. Their heads have decorated pikes for the common cry of curs to snap and growl at.\\u2019 \\u2018I've some bad news for you, John,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018I've had time to think now. If Daine really is dead, then someone's taken his place. Someone probably worse than he was.\\u2019 \\u2018Say it isn't so!\\u2019 \\u2018The City's in just as bad a shape as it always was, isn't it? Men like Marvin and Jack Elam are still running the streets. People are still dying in every gutter.\\u2019 \\u2018What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?\\u2019 \\u2018There's a new Night Mayor. There has to be. Claude Rains or Sydney Greenstreet, or one of those fancy-pants villains. They knocked him off and dressed me up for the suit with arrows.\\u2019 \\u2018There's small choice in rotten apples. Oh, hydra-headed wrongness that should spring up again redoubled when \\u2018tis smitten down!\\u2019 \\u2018You said a mouthful.\\u2019 Another big black car cruised past the diner. A door opened and a man in a hat leaned out, one foot on the running board. I had hit the floor before the machine gun went off. The picture windows shattered, and the bar cracked apart where the bullets went in. Glass and doughnuts rained around me. Carradine wasn't on the floor, alive or dead. I looked up and saw him clinging to a pipe that ran the length of one wall, high up. His long legs were wrapped round it, and he was clutching at a dangling light fitting. His cloak hung down like a curtain, and I could see streetlamps through the bullet holes in it. There was more gunfire, and containers of sugar and ketchup jumped to pieces on tabletops. The linoleum ruptured, and something heavy landed on the back of my head. Darkness wrapped around me like an anaconda. I gave in to it. Ten AFTER THE Tunney fiasco, they weren't doing anything without putting it through the full committee structure. In Trefusis's office, the governor presided over a round-table discussion, with Dr Groome, Juliet, a silent official from the Department of Conscription, and an apparently lifeless andrew head to represent Yggdrasil. Tunney had just slipped into his Richie Quick projection and gone indream expecting a swiftkick runaround the cliche track with a preordained victory at the end. Since he was no longer responding even to the encephalo beacons lodged in his unconscious, Trefusis wasn't ready to inject Susan without a full run-down of how she intended to melsh with Daine's Dream. With a certain creepy deference to the impassive head on its platter, the governor opened the meeting by onswitching a tridvid record and passing the conch to Dr Groome. The clinician, clearly out of her depth with the arts but still determined to do her best, had prepared a selection of vid snips from Daine's source flatties. \\u2018Given that, unlike Mr Tunney, you don't have a ready-made dream persona for the mission, we thought you might consider these possible role models.\\u2019 Snips passed through the view. \\u2018On balance, we felt these were the most powerful, potent female images on offer. I'm relying very much on Yggdrasil to guide me here.\\u2019 Dr Groome flashed up snips of a series of scheming, glamorous femmes fatales. Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Joan Bennett in Scarlet Street, Mary Astor in The Maltese Falcon  and Lauren Bacall in The Big Sleep. Their generous mouths worked, but the snips held the dialogue down to sub-audible level. All of them were lying to men, and yet reaching out to offscreen lovers. Susan was reminded of beautiful, poisonous sea anemones waving their fronds to suck in the unwary prey. Susan was tempted to remodel her dream image as \\u2018Phyllis Dietrichsen\\u2019 from Double Indemnity, flashing her jewelled anklet and casting off her used-up men like old cleanses, or \\u2018Vivian Sternwood\\u2019from The Big Sleep, brushing aside her curtain of hair and trading innuendoes over cigarettes with Philip Marlowe. But she could see the drawback. \\u2018Uh-huh. I've seen these pictures, Dr Groome. It was dangerous to be dangerous back then. Only Lauren Bacall gets the guy at the end, and she has to give in to get there. Barbara gets shot by Fred MacMurray, Joan is remaindered by Edward G. Robinson, and Bogart stands back while Mary Astor is hauled off to jail. If Daine's Dream adheres to the formulae, then that reads out as an unacceptable risk to me.\\u2019 \\u2018But if you get killed in the Dream, it won't hurt,\\u2019 Trefusis chipped in, \\u2018you'll just wake up.\\u2019 \\u2018That's only a theory, Governor. No one knows yet. You've already lost Tunney in there. Besides, what if I get the Maltese Falcon plot? I noticed Daine had Caged and Brute Force on his recommended-viewing list. I don't think the prisons in his Dream are quite as civilised as the one you run.\\u2019 In the view, Barbara Stanwyck was dying, beautifully, rain on her face, \\u2018Tangerine\\u2019 on the soundtrack. \\u2018Here's another recurrent characterisation\\u2026\\u2019 Dr Groome tapped up the images of Ida Lupino in High Sierra, Shelley Winters in A Double Life and Gloria Grahame in Crossfire. They all looked blowsy, lipsticky and desperate, locked in a fight with a life set to trample them into the barroom floor, a series of no-account boyfriends too free with their fists and guns, and an incipient obesity that would limit their later careers to shrill mother roles. Susan noted the still-silent official take an interest. Obviously, she could get a tridsnap of his fantasies of femininity. \\u2019\\u2026 The tart with a heart. You might be able to avoid notice as a supporting character.\\u2019 Susan shook her head. \\u2018Oh no, doctor. Those women were disposable. I did a social autopsy on these conventions. It was  all tied up with the rigid censorship restrictions of the 1940s. Because it was implied that these girls had been sexually available to a wide number of men, the hero couldn't live with them after the fade-out. They were regarded as tainted. Typically, they would be shot in the back, throwing themselves in front of the hero, and get to die pathetically in his arms. Then he lap dissolved into a happy ending with some drip like Anne Shirley.\\u2019 Trefusis threw up his hands theatrically. \\u2018I don't understand this at all. Why should it be so complicated?\\u2019 \\u2018Sexism,\\u2019 Susan said. \\u2018That's not a word that gets much use now. In the twentieth century, it meant that women got a zilch hand-out in life and the arts. These flatties were made by men and mainly for men, and trade on male fantasies. They're fixated on their male heroes. Women were supposed to be incidentals. And the stronger they were, the worse it was for them at the end of the picture. Barbara Stanwyck spent her whole career suffering and dying just because the dreamership couldn't stand to see a woman come first.\\u2019 \\u2018It was a long time ago,\\u2019 said Juliet, who had been sitting quietly. \\u2018Not long enough,\\u2019 snorted the governor. Susan looked up at the view, where Gloria Grahame was taking a pot of hot coffee full in the face in The Big Heat. Later in the picture, she would die, pressing a mink to the scarred half of her face. Exploited, mutilated and murdered. Maybe Vanessa Vail wasn't such a bad fantasy after all: she might die, but at least she was her own woman. \\u2018Did any of you ever bother to dream Tunney's Dreams?\\u2019 They all shook their heads. \\u2018He might have been here if you had. His involvement with this period and its fantasies was obvious. He used to take whole concepts, characters and moods from the flatties. I'm sure his morbid attachment to these old conventions is unhealthy. My guess is that he wished women back in their twentieth-century slot. He certainly Dreamed them that way. In Get Richie Quick!, the hero's ex-wife Lola asks him to find some missing family documents and turns out to be setting him up to take the blame for a series of axe murders she's been committing since she was six years old. At the end, you get to be inside Richie's head as he righteously kicks the poor woman to death after she's come for him with a hatchet in each hand. And the crix said  the sequels were worse. He garbage-dispersed the whodunit concepts because it was always this monster woman behind the scheme to remainder the hero. No wonder Tunney was so susceptible to Daine's Dream. He's probably gone happily native in there.\\u2019 The head gave the impression it was about to say something, but didn't. In the view, Ronald Colman strangled Shelley Winters, quoting from Othello as he did so, killing with a kiss. He spouted art and she wound up on ice. \\u2018We'd only got as far as having a preliminary psyche dissection on Daine,\\u2019 said Trefusis, \\u2018but the Yggdrasil probes suggest he had a similar-although far more pronounced \\u2014 set of personality deformities. And Daine's neural dysfunctions have shaped his Dream as much as the externals he took from his old vids.\\u2019 \\u2018Very clever. Daine and Tunney are probably soul mates. I'm likely to have to remainder Richie Quick before I get to your missing prisoner.\\u2019 \\u2018So,\\u2019 said Juliet, \\u2018if Tunney or Richie Quick or whoever he is can be fooled by a designing woman in each of his adventures, I don't see why you shouldn't get the dividend on his blind spot.\\u2019 \\u2018Good point. I just have to get outdream before the kicking scene comes along.\\u2019 Juliet looked hurt. Susan wished she hadn't wisebacked at her. In this room, the marshal was the only one who gave any indication that she valued Susan above the worth of her Public Service. Susan flashed a mental apology that seemed to sink in. \\u2018Well, Ms Bishopric,\\u2019 said Dr Groome, \\u2018if you don't want to fit into any of the roles we've assessed, just what do you want to be in the Dream?\\u2019 \\u2018It's not much of a choice. Especially since Tunney's already struck out as a private eye. In the genre terms, that ought to have made him unassailable. Private eyes always win through in the end.\\u2019 In the view, a random assemblage of snips presented a series of betrayals and murders. The films were identified by a floating tridvid legend in the bottom left corner. Ralph Meeker snapped an old man's priceless Caruso record in half in Kiss Me Deadly, Richard Conte tortured Cornel Wilde by turning up a hearing aid and shouting into it in The Big Combo, Ingrid Bergman drank the poisoned Brazilian coffee in Notorious, Charles Laughton plunged down a lift shaft in The Big Clock, Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth shot it out in a hall of mirrors in Lady from Shanghai, Edmond O'Brien lurched into a police station to report his own murder in D.O.A., Tony Curtis was brutally beaten by a corrupt cop in Sweet Smell of Success, Laurence Harvey jumped in the lake in The Manchurian Candidate. It had been a sick period, Susan decided, as monomaniacal in its obsession with violence as the D-9000's blood-and-buggery concepts. No wonder Daine was drawn so powerfully to it. For a master criminal, it must seem like the Golden Age. The people back then had been so absurdly vulnerable, prey to disease and deception. In among the monochrome massacre, someone had made a mistake; there were brightly coloured Doris Day and James Garner in Move Over Darling. \\u2018It's not much to go on, but how about a construct? Something between Gene Tierney in Laura and Ella Raines in Phantom Lady?\\u2019 \\u2018You've lost me,\\u2019 Dr Groome said. \\u2018I hadn't seen any of these vids before the crisis came up.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, we could make the censorship work for us. If I were playing an indisputably virtuous character, then clich\\u00e9 dictates that I would at least be spared death, imprisonment or degradation. I could be a hard-working career girl mixed up in a murder case, doing some solo sleuthing to get her fianc\\u00e9 off a murder charge. That sort of thing was always happening. Fianc\\u00e9s in these flatties were always zomboids with thin moustaches, always being arrested for murders they didn't commit. That was just about the only way a girl could get any equal action time, if her boyfriend was behind bars.\\u2019 Dr Groome fiddled with the slab and Ella Raines came up, walking alone at night along a deserted railroad platform. Then Gene Tierney, emerging out of the night in a ridiculous hat, surprised Dana Andrews, the cop who thought he was investigating her murder. The doctor looked at Trefusis for approval, and the Governor made a fine-by-me gesture. Nobody asked the Public Service official anything, and Yggdrasil would have spoken up if it had any strong objections. \\u2018Susan,\\u2019 said Juliet, \\u2018could you shoot anyone?\\u2019 \\u2018In a Dream, of course. As I said, I've done almost everything imaginable in Dreams. And this is, after all, only a Dream.\\u2019 \\u2018That's what Tunney said, and it swallowed him, bones and all.\\u2019 For the first time, Susan intuited that if she really made a point of it, she could get out of her Public Service. Juliet, who represented the Gunmint, could almost certainly outrule Trefusis and his penal staff in a show-of-force debate. And the professional enforcer visibly disapproved of endangering the minds of civilians in what she considered a problem for her department. It was a fine point, and it could keep Yggdrasil arguing with itself for ever: physically, Daine was still in Trefusis's jurisdiction, but if fleeing into his Dream counted as escaping from Princetown then Enforcement should take over. It occurred to Susan that this could lead to legislation she wouldn't approve of. If the Gunmint declared a citizen's dreams within its rule, then a vast but subtle freedom would be lost. Trefusis wouldn't like it, but if Susan refused to go indream, she was sure Juliet would support her. The marshal's favoured plan \\u2014 Susan gathered \\u2014 was that she should B into Daine's Dream, as herself but with a few improvements and then rip the sub-universe apart until she found the fugitive and could tase him awake. Susan knew that wouldn't work, but also that she would never be able to explain to Juliet why an amateur enforcer would have a better chance indream than a skilled public servant. Everybody thought they knew what it was like to be a Dreamer, but everybody too readily confused passive dreaming with creative Dreaming. This went beyond a legal technicality, Susan realised. Really, there were only three people in it: Daine, Tunney and herself. They were all Dreamers, and if Daine wasn't brought back to Princetown, things would go badly for all Dreamers everywhere. She didn't have to like it, any more than she had to like being Vanessa Vail, but there was no way she could evade the responsibility without racking up a seed of guilt that would sprout and eat at her Dreams. If she didn't remainder the dragon, she could forget her chance of freeing herself of the D-9000. \\u2018Susan, we can stop all this here,\\u2019 said Juliet, leaning forward. The Yggdrasil andrew's eyes slowly opened. \\u2018You can say no.\\u2019 \\u2018Fantasies can be dangerous. I'm used to that. I can't explain yet, but I have to dream Daine's Dream. It's\\u2026a professional point.\\u2019 Juliet understood that. Of course, Susan thought, the marshal had probably been inspired to get into Enforcement by dreaming Vanessa Vail \\u2014 by being Vanessa Vail \\u2014 at an impressionable age. Dreamers were for ever the vanguard, or maybe for ever the forlorn hope. \\u2018Okay, let's do it. It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to.\\u2019 \\u2018Discussion over?\\u2019 asked Trefusis. \\u2018Good. We've a tank prepared.\\u2019 Dr Groome wiped the view and started projecting mental images into it. \\u2018You'll need some externals to tap you properly into the Dream. A clothe, a hairstyle, some props.\\u2019 Dr Groome projected a mannequin and roughed out a tailored suit. The psych was surprisingly inventive. Susan particularly liked the hat, which was perhaps a touch mannish for her chosen persona but passed thanks to its raffish qualities. The psych smiled. \\u2018I don't know much about flatties, but historical fashions are my pash. I've a collection of antique accessories. Yggdrasil can encode them into your indream simulacrum. The least we can do is dress you for effect. Tunney went in looking like a Redevelopment reject.\\u2019 \\u2018And I've been thinking about guns,\\u2019 said Juliet. \\u2018You'll need to think up something.\\u2019 The mannequin faded, and the snips came back. In the view, more actors died. Eleven \\u2018ALL THAT WE SEE or seem is but a dream within a dream\\u2026\\u2019 Who said that? Edgar Allan Poe? Or Vincent Price? In the dark, I dreamed the unpopulated dreams of the amnesiac. I dreamed I was on a case. I was looking for a man named Tom Tunney, a washed-out writer and a deep-dyed drunk. Lissa, his ex-wife, wanted him found and substantial alimony coughed up. She also wanted to know if he was dead or alive, just out of general interest. Nice lady. Body by Bacall, hair like Hedy's, face from Frances Farmer and penny-bright eyes like a week-old corpse. I had traced Tunney out of the City to a big house with high broken-glass-topped walls where the rich and inebriated pay to have their vices purged. He had been there and gone. The doctors told me he was unimproved by his stay with them. I could believe it. When the informants ran out, I kept on the man's trail by following the empties. I always keep a bottle in my desk drawer, but this character was putting it away on an industrial scale. With Lissa's money I picked up his tabs. Bartenders, hoteliers and B-girls kept asking me if I was Tunney's brother. The resemblance, they said, was amazing. Lissa hadn't had a photograph for me to flash, but had described him as looking \\u2018a lot like you, Mr Quick, a lot like you\\u2019. She had made a pass at me, of course, but I had left her and her dead eyes in her big, empty house. I make a policy of never fooling around with my clients. It's kept me alive so far. From the dry-out farm, Tunney had moved down to the border, mooched around in cantinas for a while, then left the country two steps ahead of the sheriff of some Rio Grande jerkwater. I followed by car and burro, tracking him from town  to town. The bottles marked his way through the desert, like cat's-eyes down a street. I made some deposit money back on as many as I could carry. The rest I left out there with the bones of prehistoric animals, as a sign for future generations that there had been civilisation in the Americas. Tunney had made a lot of friends along the way, until his travelling money ran out. After that, he made a lot of enemies. I interviewed some of them. Three beer-befuddled construction workers played softball with my head in a backstreet on the mistaken assumption that I was Tom Tunney. With the bruises and a three-day beard, I was told I looked even more like him than I had done. Lissa's money gave out, and she told me over an international phone hook-up that she wasn't interested any more. She was remarrying \\u2014 to a war hero, of course, just like all the girls that year \\u2014 and didn't want to know either way about her former husband. \\u2018He was just a no-account,\\u2019 she told me, \\u2018a Dreamer.\\u2019 But I was too far along to drop it that easily. I'm a detective, so I feel obliged to detect. I was finding out more and more about my quarry's life. From the witnesses, I picked up details about his work, his friends, his childhood, his Dreams. And, with each scrap of information I unearthed about Tom Tunney, I seemed to forget something about myself. I found myself using his name on hotel registers, in barroom conversations. I realised, with a shock, that I was drinking almost constantly. One evening, I sat in a cantina with a row of bottles on the bar, and tried to remember absurdly small things about my own life. I couldn't remember the make of car I drove, how my girlfriend looked naked, what I had done before I got my PI licence, what shape my bathroom was, my parents' names. I knew more about Tom Tunney than about Richie Quick. The man I had not found yet was real to me, but I was a phantom, as flat and one-sided as Dick Tracy or Steve Canyon. I was staring at a wall-sized mirror when he walked into the bar. Over my own shoulder, I saw his face come out of the shadows. For the briefest of instants, I was standing up looking in the mirror at the face of a man at the bar\\u2026 Then the curtains parted, and I was back in the City. Back in the night. Back in the pain. \\u2018Heavens be praised, my boy,\\u2019 said Carradine. \\u2018I thought you were dead for sure!\\u2019 I opened my eyes, was assaulted by the light, and shut them again. \\u2018Easy now,\\u2019 said the deep, resonant voice. \\u2018Step by step.\\u2019 I opened my eyes again, less painfully. I was still on the floor of Kelly's, surrounded by smashed tables and bulletholes. I was sitting in a congealed pool of stickiness. I felt myself for wounds, and couldn't find any. The mess was just spilled ketchup. Maybe my luck was changing. \\u2018Not a mark on him,\\u2019 said Thelma, \\u2018saints be praised!\\u2019 She had a rosary out, and was knotting it around one hand like a beaded bandage. Carradine helped me up. I was unsteady on my feet, and my head felt like a leftover battlefield, but everything seemed to be in more or less working order. There was ketchup on my trench coat, but it would wash off in time. \\u2018Looks like you're right about there being a new man at the top,\\u2019 said Carradine, \\u2018and he's just paid you his friendly compliments.\\u2019 Kelly grunted, seemingly no more upset by the destruction of his diner than he would have been by a broken plate. He was in a grimy apron, sweeping up. There were fresh bullet scars on the walls, like the ones in Daine's penthouse. Exactly like, I could see the same patterns \\u2014 faces, almost \\u2014 in the damage. \\u2018Marvin and the others must have set you up. They'll all be with the new man by now.\\u2019 Things had changed while I was out, but I couldn't tell how yet. I had the memory of a headache now, but my head was clear. That felt like a first. \\u2018We'd best be out of here, Richie,\\u2019 Carradine said. \\u2018They might come back.\\u2019 It took me a moment to realise he was talking to me. \\u2018Yeah. I'm sorry about the mess, Kelly\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018That's okay\\u2019 the chef said dully, \\u2018it's been worse before. When the Muni Mob and Jimmy Cagney had a gang war, they tossed in hand grenades every twenty minutes.\\u2019 Carradine helped me get out of the diner, but I didn't feel so bad. Some of the earlier aches had faded, and the new ones hadn't had time to get settled in. It was still raining, but it was a hard, fast, clean downpour now, washing garbage off the sidewalks. \\u2018We better get you off the main streets, you're a target\\u2026\\u2019 It hit me. \\u2018John, what happened to the pidgin Shakespeare? You sound almost Hemingway. Well, maybe Steinbeck.\\u2019 His long face was quizzical. \\u2018I guess it wore off. It's been a funny kind of an evening. I feel like I've just woken up after a long dream;\\u2019 \\u2018I know how you feel.\\u2019 \\u2018It's as if only the last few hours of my life were real. I could tell you my story up until then, but it happened to someone else, an imaginary character.\\u2019 We walked a couple of blocks, looking in vain for a cab. Carradine struck me somehow as unusual, even for the City. He was spilling over, out of his stereotype, confused about his role. \\u2018I've got things in my head that came from nowhere,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018things that don't make sense to me. Clues, I guess you'd call them.\\u2019 \\u2018Clues? Like what?\\u2019 \\u2018The World Tree,\\u2019 he muttered, \\u2018something about the World Tree, Richie. No, that's not it. Damn it, but it'll come to me in a moment. I'm sure it will.\\u2019 \\u2018Yggdrasil,\\u2019 I said, \\u2018the World Tree.\\u2019 \\u2018That's it. Yggdrasil. Queer sort of a word, isn't it?\\u2019 I remembered Yggdrasil. The wooden fist of Viking legend, wrapped around the world, extending its branches everywhere. Only my Yggdrasil wasn't wood, but something else alive. In my mind, I had a crazed vision of a composite creature, with iceboxes and radiograms and vacuum cleaners and electric chairs and telephone exchanges for nerve endings, trucks and aircraft and cranes and streamlined trains for limbs, and perhaps a Bomb for a brain. \\u2018It has something to do with Daine, and the way he ran the City. It's not much to go on, but it's a start.\\u2019 I knew where to go now. I started steering Carradine, rather than him supporting me. He hesitated, but followed my lead. I guessed he wanted the answers too. \\u2018We'll have to find out who Daine's heir is. Or maybe it's not an heir, exactly. Maybe we're after his ghost.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you mean?\\u2019 \\u2018I don't know. I saw him dead. There's no doubt about that. And things have changed since he got remaindered, but I've got this feeling \\u2014 call it a detective's intuition \\u2014 that he left something of himself behind. The City's still his in some way, held in trust.\\u2019 It was in a sleazy neighbourhood, but then again so were most places in the City. We approached it cautiously, in case the cops had it staked out. I had Carradine walled up and down the street several times, acting suspiciously. Nobody came for him. He stood on the steps outside the building, tattered cloak flapping like a scarecrow's nightshirt, and signalled to me. Then we went up to my office to do some serious detective work. Twelve IN MY OFFICE, Carradine cat-napped, snoring vigorously, hammocked between two chairs. The irritating neon sign outside the window strobed the room, broken Venetian blinds breaking the light into bright bars. I had the radio on low, in case they interrupted the broadcast with any bulletins that might lead me to the new Night Mayor. Meanwhile, I went through my files. I call it an office, but it's also an apartment. I was sure I lived there, but I couldn't remember if there was a bedroom attached. If there was, I couldn't find it now. There were plenty of filing cabinets, with half-full bottles, and an empty water cooler that I evidently kept as an excuse to have a tower of paper cups. While Carradine slept, I tried to take away the taste of defeat and Kelly's coffee with a shot or fourteen. It was supposed to be good whisky, but the thin layer of dust in the bottom of all the cups didn't improve the taste any. Daine's booze had tasted like sugared water, mine was like sugared water with added grit. I licked my teeth, and started digging. At some earlier, more enthusiastic, stage in my career as a detective I had compiled dossiers on everyone of any importance in the City. Cotten of the Inquirer must have helped me out, because every file was complete with news clippings and candid photographs. Those friends on the police force who would doubtless fail to remember me these nights had even let me have carbons of a few rap sheets. I considered calling up one of contacts and declaring my innocence, but decided against it. Until I had myself out of the frame, it wasn't a good idea to drag anyone into the case who wasn't there already. Besides, I had had time to pick up the late edition. PRIVATE EYE SOUGHT  IN DAINE SLAYING was the headline, and Cotten's byline was over the story. The way he wrote it, I guessed he was as sure as anyone that I had been the trigger man. All my friends would be busy with their ink erasers trying to scrub me out of their address books. Especially my cop friends. I trusted Carradine because he was different, but trusting him led to mistrusting everyone else. \\u2018It's like being a reverse zombie,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I'm alive, but everybody else is dead.\\u2019 Enough people were after me. The fewer who knew where I was, the better. Someone had been at the office, of course. The door had been kicked in, and the chaos rearranged. They hadn't found anything, and had gone back to their usual haunts. Cops or hoods, it didn't matter. They had probably both paid a visit. And they'd call again later, which was why I was working by a single-bulb desk lamp, quickskimming the liquid and document overflow from my filing cabinets. The frosted glass panel with my name on it had been cracked, but that could have happened at any time. I pulled the Daine file first. It was the thickest. There he was in all his splendour, gazing blithely out of society-column illustrations, going into or coming out of some swank nightspot or other, with a gorgeous girl on either arm. Socialite Lyn Bari, nightclub chanteuse Lizabeth Scott, ecdysiast Rita Hayworth, fiery senorita Dolores Del Rio: they had all been names in his little black book. No wonder he looked so smug in most of his photographs. Recently, his \\u2018constant companion\\u2019 had been Rhonda Fleming. In one shot, Daine could be seen in the background while Rhonda was trying to scratch out the eyes of a competitor for his attentions, Arlene Dahl. The headline was CAT FIGHT CUTIES! Wealth, power, dames: Daine couldn't have Dreamed up a better situation for himself in the City if he had been trying. Most of the clippings were boring stories about charity functions, civic balls, philanthropic gestures, patriotic speeches or War Bond drives. There were endless party guest lists, with Daine's name \\u2014 and certain others \\u2014 circled. There were even inventories of his collection, with fabulous sums paid for a succession of sculptures, paintings, original scores and manuscripts or items of historical interest. In one picture, Daine was showing off his most prized trophies \\u2014 the longbow with which  Errol Flynn had driven the Normans out of Sherwood Forest, Leslie Howard's Ku Klux Klan hood and the original telephone invented by Don Ameche. There were gossip-column items, too, about such-and-such an amusing practical joke played on William Powell or this-and-that fancy present given to Carole Lombard. All very innocuous stuff. I had underlined the few shady connections which made it into the open. Daine's closest pals were Claude Rains, the radio criminologist, and Otto Kruger, who was some sort of phony-baloney mystic. They were part of the Cicero Club, a society which met once a month or so to discuss famous unsolved mysteries. I had made notations by the Cicero Club stories. There must be something spicy in that combination: Daine could have solved at least three quarters of the crimes in the City just by owning up. And in their own dossiers, I found a few suggestive hints to the effect that Rains and Kruger were hardly spotless. Nothing overt, of course, but a few too many underworld contacts, a few too many mysterious bequests. Rains and Daine had owned a piece of Kirk Douglas, a promising young heavyweight whose career had been ended by a \\u2018cerebral haemorrhage\\u2019 in the ring, just in time for Kruger and a few others to collect a parcel by betting against him. And who was the bruiser who gave Kirk the big headache? Our old friend Mike Mazurki. When Daine had first come to the City, he had \\u2014 I knew for a fact \\u2014 taken over a large proportion of the vice business that had been run by Paul Muni, a mobster whose empire had fallen thanks mainly to the investigative efforts and single-mindedness of \\u2014 you guessed it \\u2014 criminologist Claude Rains. I had been trying to get a membership list for the Cicero Club, but the only other name I could come up with was George Macready, a scarfaced iceman who had a profitable share of the City's gambling and was best known for his sword-extruding walking stick. Nice people. There were other possibles \\u2014 mostly underworld figures \\u2014 but I discounted them as red herrings. Sydney Greenstreet was too old to be taking much of an interest, and had in any case become obsessed with some obscure quest of his own, neglecting his \\u2018business\\u2019. Whoever the new man at the top was, I would have staked plenty that his first move would be to squeeze Sydney out and add his former holdings to the pot. A chubby young man called Laird Cregar appealed to me as a suspect, if only because he had the habit of being seen loitering around places  where beautiful women had just been strangled. But his plump face and crazed eyes suggested he was merely a psychotic. A more refined psycho than, say, Lee Marvin or Neville Brand, but a crazy's still a crazy and I didn't think someone that far gone could take up where Daine had left off. Cregar might lounge in silk  pajamas and stuff himself with Parisian chocolates, but he was still a supporting heavy, a cringing underling who'd never last at the top of the criminal tree. George Sanders was out of the running now, having been hauled in as an enemy spy, but I'd be interested in knowing who precisely had tipped the Feds off to his brokerage for state secrets in the suburbs. Orson Welles was too busy with his radio show, Bela Lugosi could never get any master plan together beyond his next insane experiment, Vincent Price wouldn't rank with the major bad guys until horror pictures caught on again, and Zachary Scott's thin moustache betrayed his lack of substance as a mastermind. My best bets were still Rains and Kruger. One, or both, of them could easily have opted to give Daine a hot lead push and taken the operation over. Or maybe it was more complicated than that. Maybe Daine had somehow cooperated in his own extermination, but transferred something of himself to his heir. In Otto Kruger's file, there were a bunch of crackpot pieces on various psychic phenomena-hypnotism, mental telepathy, oneiromancy, possession. Maybe Daine had gone dybbuk and passed into another body. Metempsychosis, that was called. It was screwy, but so was everything else in this case. I had the feeling I had been given most of the pieces, but not the boxfront picture to tell me how to put them together. I looked at some pictures of Rhonda Fleming. She favoured very tight gowns with large pieces cut out of them. There had to be a woman in the picture. With me, there invariably was. I took my automatic out and rested its cold metal on Rhonda's paper torso. She was some kind of a woman all right. Cute as lace pants, sharp as a stiletto and hungry as a Bengal tiger. I hoped we'd get to meet some time soon. \\u2018We interrupt this broadcast,\\u2019 said an announcer, fading out Jos\\u00e9 Iturbi, \\u2018to bring you an important newsflash\\u2026\\u2019 The urgent tones startled Carradine awake, and with a cry, he fell off his chairs. The furniture tangled in his long legs. \\u2019\\u2026 Captain of Detectives Barton MacLane has called out the National Guard to assist in the search for private detective  Richard Quick, who is still at liberty. Quick is wanted in connection with the brutal murder earlier this evening of millionaire philanthropist Truro\\u2026\\u2019 I turned off the radio, wrenching the knob off the set. It was the same old guff. I had heard it all before. \\u2018Perhaps you'd better get out of the City,\\u2019 suggested Carradine. \\u2018Perhaps there isn't an outside to go to.\\u2019 \\u2018Sure there is.\\u2019 He smiled. \\u2018I remember the prairies. Why, I remember being in a stagecoach, with the Apaches attacking, and out on the road with Henry Fonda and the Okies and shooting Tyrone Power while he was hanging up a picture\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018Are you sure, John?\\u2019 I knew how memories like that worked. Right now, in the familiar clutter of my office, I had this feeling in my water that I had never been in the room before. Someone's hand had torn away three quarters of the days of the desktop calendar and filled a wastebasket with them, and someone had written girls' names and telephone numbers on the blotters. I recognised my own handwriting and the way I would scrunch up a calendar date before throwing it away. But I couldn't see myself actually scribbling or tearing. That had been someone else. Maybe it was me. Maybe I was the ghost. \\u2018Are you sure?\\u2019 Carradine's eyes saw faraway sights, and he ran a hand through his shoulder-length hair. \\u2018No, now you come to mention it, I'm not. Those things happened, I know that, and I could swear they happened to me. But maybe in other lives, or in\\u2026\\u2019 I lit a cigarette. \\u2019\\u2026In Dreams, John, Dreams. There are too many maybes in the City, too many dreams within Dreams. You were asleep just now; were you dreaming?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, I\\u2026\\u2019 He looked scared for a moment; then almost scary, stroking his moustache with long, thin fingers, thoughtfully tonguing sharp teeth. I exhaled a cloud of smoke. The neon striped it in the air. \\u2018What were you dreaming?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm not certain. I was dead, but alive. I was wearing evening clothes like a dress extra, and I had flour in my hair. It was somewhere in Eastern Europe, I think. The men wore lederhosen and the women gypsy blouses. It was modern times, but there  was no war. And I was thirsty\\u2026it's difficult to say, I wanted\\u2026to\\u2026drink\\u2026blood.\\u2019 The tall man was racked with self-disgust. I couldn't help but feel for him. \\u2018Don't worry, John, it's just a dream. Just another role seeping through.\\u2019 \\u2018Ugh. It was repulsive. Were there any clues in your files?\\u2019 I rifled the papers on the desk. \\u2018Just names. Claude Rains, Otto Kruger, George Macready. They were tied in with Daine, maybe still are\\u2026\\u2019 Under the files, the telephone rang. Carradine and I looked at each other. The ringing was startlingly loud. I knew that if there was anyone else at all in the building, they'd be alerted to it. It grated on my eardrums, set my teeth on edge, shook loose all the pains I thought I had lost. \\u2018They'll give up,\\u2019 I said. We stood hunched over the desk, frozen like waxworks. The telephone rang twenty, forty, a hundred times, and kept on ringing. It got louder, more painful. I saw a bead of sweat drip from Carradine's forehead, trickle down his cheek, perch on the end of his moustache and fall with a small splash onto a picture of Rhonda Fleming posing in a backless, strapless, practically frontless dress. \\u2018They can't possibly expect an answer.\\u2019 Carradine was shaking, holding onto my desk with both hands to keep steady. I followed the telephone cord and found where it went into the wall. One tug and the noise would go away. But whoever was calling would know someone was here. Perhaps the cops had a man calling up every half hour, and a squad car ready to be here in seconds. They had let me slip through the net earlier; they wouldn't exactly be fans of mine. And the National Guard were on the case now. They'd have much bigger guns than me, and be authorised to use them. I put my hands over my ears and prayed that the ringing would stop. Everything in the office was vibrating. I knew how the Hunchback of Notre Dame had gone deaf, with the tinnitus for ever in his head. With a strangled, gargling shriek, Carradine fell over, frothing at the mouth, arms waving. A pile of documents, clippings and photographs fell with him and drifted around him as he writhed on the floor. The ringing stopped, and gave a silent thanks to St Bernadette of Lourdes for the miracle. Then I realised Carradine had knocked the phone off the hook when he fell, and that the receiver was dangling under the desk  \\u2018Tunney,\\u2019 said a female voice, tiny but shouting, \\u2018Tunney, pick up the damned phone if you're there. We need to talk. Tunney\\u2026\\u2019 Almost laughing, I took the receiver. \\u2018Hello,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Tunney. Yggdrasil be praised. Listen, I'm at the bus station. You need help. My name is Susan. Susan Bishopric. We've met. We lobbied the British Board of Dream Classification over the blasphemy rulings. I Dreamed The Parking Lottery.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm sorry, lady,\\u2019 I said, \\u2018but you must have the wrong number. My name isn't Tunney.\\u2019 I hung up, and went to help Carradine. He had stopped twitching violently, but he wasn't out of his petit mal yet. His limbs were working independently of each other. \\u2018Snap out of it,\\u2019 I said, flicking him lightly about the cheeks with my fingers, \\u2018we've got to get out of here. That might not have been a wrong number. Somebody could have put the finger on us.\\u2019 He wiped the froth from his lips with a huge handkerchief and apologised for his behaviour. \\u2018I don't know what got into me. It was the telephone. It didn't sound\\u2026natural.\\u2019 \\u2018I know what you mean. But I'm not sure there's any nature at all in this case.\\u2019 Outside my office window, the irritating neon sign flashed on and off, casting rigid bars of light into the room. Prison bars. Thirteen WHERE TO, lady?\\u2019 asked the cab driver. Susan recognised W the desperate whine in his voice, but read the name off his licence anyway. Elisha Cook Jr, professional loser, fall guy and victim. Cook had the face of a shrunken Peter Pan, lost in adulthood. \\u2018Cruise,\\u2019 said Susan. \\u2018I just want to get out of the rain.\\u2019 \\u2018It's your dough, sister.\\u2019 Cook manhandled the meter flag. It ran like a click-click-clack off the beaten track as the Brownsville Train comes through, like the tick-tack-toe of Old Black Joe\\u2026 Susan snapped, \\u2018I ain't your sister, bud!\\u2019 Was that correct? Ain't? Bud? \\u2018Pardon me for livin', lady.\\u2019 \\u2018One of these days, if you work at it real hard.\\u2019 \\u2018Say \\u2014\\u2019 Cook's worn veneer of toughness dissolved-'quit ridin' me. I ain't hostile.\\u2019 \\u2018Sorry. It's late.\\u2019 She had miscalculated: she thought everyone in the City insulted each other. \\u2018I've had a rough evening.\\u2019 \\u2018Me too. I been beaten up by hoods, framed on a murder rap, beaten up by cops, sent up the river, beaten up by prison bulls, got a last-minute reprieve from the governor, and been beaten up by my girl.\\u2019 \\u2018Sounds tough.\\u2019 \\u2018In spades, lady.\\u2019 Yeah: in spades, on ice, eight ways to sundown, from here to eternity. It was a different language. An idiot Dream if ever there was. She knew she mustn't give in to it. There was a risk of ending up like Tunney. On the phone, he had sounded in a bad way. She  had called him up from the bus station as soon as she got into the City. It had been ridiculously easy to track him down. Richard Quick, Private Enquiry Agent, was in the Yellow Pages under Detectives. Humphrey Bogart, Dick Powell and Alan Ladd had big display adverts with prominent slogans: \\u2018No Divorce Work\\u2019, \\u2018Trouble Is My Business\\u2019, \\u2018This Gun for Hire\\u2019. Quick was buried in a column of single-line ads for grade-B bloodhounds, between Dick Purcell and Ron Randell. His irresistible come-on was \\u2018Investigations-Cheap!\\u2019 For now, she'd have to leave Tunney to his own problems and go after Daine. Over the smart street clothes DF Groome had come up with she wore a transparent raincoat. She must look like a cellophane wrapped sweet. A hard-boiled sweet. She checked her lipstick in the cab's mirror. Her face had come out more like Ella Raines that Gene Tierney. Too thin-lipped for high-gloss romance, but pretty in a hard-edged, sparkly fashion. She would have to get used to the way she looked in black and white. In the short time she had been in the City, she had been propositioned by a well-dressed lush, witnessed a gangland execution and been pursued through a deserted subway station by a  bulky killer. This would take some getting used to. The Princetown psychs had simply lost track of Tunney. They had monitored him as far as Poverty Row, then the Dream had upside-downed. A major shadow reality shift. This place looked solid enough from the inside, but it could change as quickly as your mind. Susan Bishopric, assassin. That was a new paragraph for her curriculum vitae. Kill Truro Daine. In this Dream, that was tantamount to putting out a contract on God. But God makes mistakes. Ask lob. Daine had been caught and convicted back in the real world. That would put a dent in his omnipotence. Even here. Dreaming herself into the City had been easy. Dr Groome had hooked Susan up to Yggdrasil and floated her in the third tank. Trefusis had wished her luck, Juliet had told her to shoot straight, and the psych techs had tried not to look her in the eyes. Then she had descended through the familiar outer layers of Dreamspace, and faded in on the bus. She found to her surprise that she didn't mind the clothes. Whenever she Dreamed historicals, she always assumed  multiple garments would be uncomfortable and cumbersome, like a non-protective flakjak. Actually, she quite liked nylons, padded shoulders and her hat. And pockets were a revelation. Her gun hung heavy in her suit coat, resting cool against her hip. She put a hand in her pocket and felt the grip of the weapon. Juliet had given her a few pointers, but indream Susan found her experience as Vanessa Vail somehow more confidence-building. Vanessa could shoot the eye out of a gnat at fifty paces. Susan hoped the skill would come back to her if it came to guns. Cook drove clumsily, keeping up a constant stream of chatter. Susan volumed him down. Poor little chump. Tired eyes flashing in the rearview mirror, childish enthusiasm bubbling over. He was marked for a fade-out long before the finish. Susan couldn't think of a film where he had made it alive to the end credits. The cab paused at an intersection to give right of way to a car chase. Edward G. Robinson careened down Elm Street and screech-turned onto Sunset Boulevard. The only things holding his stolen sedan together were bulletholes. Lieutenant Ward Bond was at the wheel of the police convertible hot on his tail. Detective Van Heflin stood up in the car, hat clamped to his head, firing his tommy gun from the hip. \\u2018He killed a dame,\\u2019 explained Cook, \\u2018strangled her with a string of pearls. The cops will get him. Nobody gets away with murder in this City.\\u2019 \\u2018There's always a first time.\\u2019 Experimentally, she flicked the cold steel safety catch on and off in her pocket. She was wearing a groove in her thumb. What to do next? Hole up, hide out, get the measure of the Dream. Then start feeding in a few amendments. That would offbalance Daine. She was certain she could make some substantial changes. Perhaps Daine wouldn't like what she was planning for his self-designed afterlife. She concentrated on the interior doorhandles of the cab and changed their design several times, just for practice, then smoothed them out entirely. No problem. Should she try to get in touch with Tunney again? He was stuck in the City somewhere. The tentative diagnosis was that he had been too close to Daine's fantasies and been subsumed into the structure of the Dream. Deep down, he had felt too much at  home in the City to want to see it deleted from the Yggdrasil file. All this might have the makings of a Prix Italia memoir. There were very few Dreams about Dreams and Dreaming. But first, she would have to come through it alive (relatively easy: keep repeating, none of this is real, it's only a Dream) and sane (a horse of a different colour: like in The Wizard of Oz)\\u2026 She looked down at her feet, and ruby slippers briefly superimposed on her patent-leather pumps. Follow the Yellow Brick Road! Follow the Yellow Brick Road\\u2026 Stop! That had been bothering her since she hit the City. Was her own brain kinking her around, or was Daine trying to tie her mental patterns in knots? They hadn't been able to\\u2013 tell her whether he would automatically sense any new presences in his Dream, and lateral thinking was the Dreamer's occupational disease. Irrelevant associations dredged out of the mind's mire of trace memories, subconscious detritus and stamped-on feelings. There was only one cure: reality. Of which there was precisely none about. She would have to put up with occasional Sinatra-outs until she was out of the tank. Outside an elevated railroad station men in raincoats with collars turned up and hats with brims snapped down bustled busily, coming from and going to nowhere in particular. Robert Walker, a soldier in uniform, was fighting his way through the crowd, a bunch of flowers and a marriage licence in his hand, wading against the human tide to the shining spot under the clock where Judy Garland stood, dressed in angelic white that stood out against the drab extras, waiting anxiously. Susan checked the clock. It was two thirty. Down the road a little, a streetlamp spotlit a grubby newsstand. Cook idled the cab. \\u2018Extree! Extree!\\u2019 cried the freckle-faced Mickey Rooney. \\u2018Private eye wanted for murder! Extree! Extree!\\u2019 \\u2018Hold on here a minute.\\u2019 \\u2018Sure, sister. I got all night.\\u2019 Susan reached for the doorhandle and found only smooth upholstery. She flipped her mind and the handle came back, a size or two too large. She opened the door\\u2013 slipped the hood of her see-through up over her hat and stepped into the ram. The newsboy, cap turned backwards, waved his paper in the air, still shouting. \\u2018Can I have an Inquirer?\\u2019 \\u2018For def, doll.\\u2019 He pulled a paper off his stand and accepted some small change. \\u2018By the way, I get off in half an hour.\\u2019 \\u2018Fresh.\\u2019 \\u2018As eggs.\\u2019 Rooney grinned and nervously ran a wet hand under his cap, smoothing his tousled hair. Susan stood under an awning and read the extra. Banner headline: PRIVATE EYE WANTED FOR MURDER! Smaller-type captions: \\u2018Philanthropist Truro Daine Still Dead. Enquiry Agent Richie Quick Wanted by Police. \\u2018No Statement at This Time,\\u2019 Says Commissioner Neil Hamilton. \\u2018We'll Fry the Rat Yet!\\u2019 Vows Chief of Detectives Barton MacLane.\\u2019 There was a picture of Daine doing the samba at a nightclub, and a grainy passpic of Tom Tunney passed off as Richie Quick. They both looked dead. The text, after the first one-sentence paragraph, was a jumble of meaningless words. The only other story was a flyer about the war. After the front page, the rest of the paper was blank. \\u2018Extree!\\u2014 Extree!\\u2019 shouted the newsboy, \\u2018Spine-Snapper Strikes Again. Scotland Yard Baffled! Extree! Extree!\\u2019 That paper was for someone else. Susan recognised Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, somehow not quite anachronistic in deerstalker and bowler hat, as they consulted over their extra. Bruce was flustered, but Rathbone seized on a minute clue and rattled off a string of deductions. \\u2018Ah-ha, Bruce, the clouds part. I do believe this bloody business betrays the involvement of our old friend Professor Lionel Atwill. Evidently the reports of his death in the sewers of Montevideo were exaggerated. The gorilla footprints, the Ecuadorian pygmy poison and the six-fingered alabaster hand are most suggestive. Quick, the game is afoot!\\u2019 They hurried off, Rathbone with an excited spring in his step, Bruce huffing and puffing to keep up with him, and passed out of the rain into a street wedged thick with fog. Susan could see a gaslamp vaguely in the murk, and hear the clip of hooves on cobblestones. That was another part of the City. This was a weird Dream. She ducked back into the cab. In the mirror, Cook's eyes were white marbles. The windshield was a white spiderweb or cracks centring on a neat black circle. There was a matching neat black circle in Cook's forehead too. Cliche. Fourteen KRUGER AND RAINS were our most up-front suspects, so I decided to start with the mystery man of the Cicero Club, George Macready. I knew a little about him. He had come from out of town with a fortune, was known to have been a vociferous Bund supporter before the war and had set up a chain of more or less above-board casinos in the districts where gambling was more or less legal. He had a high-rolling joint on the SS Nocturne,a ship anchored outside the limits, and some nasty rumours had floated back on the tides along with a well-dressed corpse or two. But by far the worst of his establishments was the Noir et Blanc, a palatial clipjoint on the waterfront. Some people said that gambling should be illegal throughout the City. Other people muttered that, the way Macready had it set up, what went on in his places wasn't really gambling. There were plenty of conflicting stories about the way he got the scar that ran from temple to chin down the right side of his face. None of them were pretty. On the side, he ran an art gallery with Vincent Price, which didn't sound exactly legitimate either. Carradine and I decided he was most likely to be in the Noir et Blanc. Besides, neither of us liked the idea of the swim out to the Nocturne. There were sharks out in the bay, and they didn't get fed often enough. The waterfront was a vile district, further gone even than Chinatown. The worst elements of the Latin Quarter, little Araby, New Haiti and the Occupied Sector flowed together in an open sewer of vice, crime and callousness. Brownstones cosied up to slums, police cars were armoured, and everything was for sale. A row of dubious cafes with misspelled French names huddled together, while the streets were  aswarm with vendors hawking bogus curios, limping sailors down on their luck, scuttling coolies with slit eyes and concealed daggers, and pop-eyed black zombies lurching on mysterious missions. I wondered if Anna May Wong had passed this way. Through the squalor threaded a well-guarded street. Limousines slid across the asphalt, decadent thrill-seekers cringing behind their curtained windows. Macready had men posted on the sidewalks to protect his customers' money on their way to the casino. After they left, they were on their own. We were too hot to take a cab, so we just sauntered along with the crowds. I was hoping the cops down here would be too busy lining their pockets to pay much attention to the all-points bulletin out on me. We hadn't seen the National Guard yet. Carradine caught a half-naked Moroccan boy with his hand deep in my pocket, and threw him over a low wall. Dogs barked and snapped, and we heard the sneak thief running barefoot into a maze of alleyways, bomb sites and derelict hotels. I still had my gun and what was left of Sterling Hayden's money. Perhaps I should try to pick up a little extra at Macready's tables. Then again, perhaps not. In one of my-newspaper clippings, he was quoted as having said, \\u2018I make my own luck.\\u2019 The suicide rate in this quarter was unnaturally high, and the insurance companies had established a definite connection between owing large sums of money to George Macready and accidental death. There was enough blood on the streets down here already. A crowd had gathered around one of the piers, where Marlon Brando and Lee J. Cobb were tearing chunks out of each other with docker's hooks. We were offered a variety of tempting odds by a rat-faced freak with a clutch of money in one hand and promissory notes in the other. I passed. \\u2018There,\\u2019 said Carradine. The Noir et Blanc was a palace all right, lit up like a carnival float. Flags of all nations hung like gibbeted criminals from a row of poles just under the roof. It was probably an optical illusion, but the place seemed to be flying more eagles and swastikas than stars and stripes. Gargoyles spewed rainwater. Crowds of men and women were swarming up the front steps to the three revolving doors. They looked like sacrifices crushing themselves into the mouths of Moloch. A gigantic neon roulette wheel revolved under the Noir et Blanc sign. \\u2018Quite a sight, isn't it?\\u2019 We pressed into the throng and allowed ourselves to be sucked forwards, up the steps. I wasn't sure that our clothing would pass muster at the doors, but others in the crowd were even more outlandish and uncivilised. I saw the major-domo turn away a couple weighed down with medal ribbons and jewels, while admitting a fat young man in a greasy fez and ragged robe. We were let through with barely a curled lip, and found ourselves in a foyer hardly smaller than a pyramid. It would have been a good place to hold a torchlight rally. Macready must have enlisted the services of Cecil B. DeMille as an architect. The place was done up in his trademarked colossal style, with a huge pair of well-muscled stone legs standing astride the doorway to the main casino. The ceiling, inconceivably far above our heads and leprous with chandeliers, cut off the legs at mid-thigh. I had the impression the statue extended through the upper floors. The gigantically helmeted head of some biblical hero would stick out through the roof and stand like an Easter Island monolith among the chimneys and machine-gun emplacements, jewelled eyes blazing with golem life. We held on to our coats for fear of never seeing them again, and mingled with the doomed souls. Doors five times the height of the average giraffe opened between the statue's ankles, and the latest intake of victims were swept inside. We went along with them. The central cavern of the Noir et Blanc was the gambling hell Dante might have designed. The roulette wheels were sunk in circular pits. The most irredeemably damned, in their white dinner jackets and turbans or strapless black sheaths and dripping jewellery, clogged up the lower circles, dropping chips onto the grid as if casting swill to the pigs. At the very lowest level, a wheel fully twelve feet across was spun by a pair of mountainous Turkish wrestlers in tiny loincloths, while a bent and crippled croupier, Mischa Auer, shrieked numbers at the losers. People had been trampled to the floor around the wheel. Auer was suspended in a hanging basket, his dead legs dangling beneath him, reaching out with a surreally long scoop to dredge the chips into a central sinkhole. A girl lunged over the grid, screaming that she had made a mistake, fingers just missing the disappearing chips. One of the wrestlers tipped her up by her ankles, and she too vanished into the hole, high-heeled pumps kicking as she was swallowed by whatever machine or animal lurked below. The wheel kept spinning, the damned kept pouring away their money. The higher tiers housed lesser wheels, chemin de fer, blackjack, slot machines, vingt-et-un, baccarat, five-card stud. Stricken friends and dangerous parasites, penniless would-be gamblers seeking a vicarious thrill and subtle pickpockets in the pay of the house mingled with the addicts. Silent orientals passed among the clientele, serving drinks and notes of credit. Two czarist officers, bulky in their comic-opera uniforms, solemnly played Russian roulette, each downing a drink every time the firing pin of their revolver came down on an empty chamber. The din was intolerable: overlapping dialogue in several languages, dowagers with laughter like painted nails down a blackboard, the endless rattle of the wheels, occasional gunshots, screams of unknown origin, the gravel-under-waves chink of piles of money turning over again and again, the shouts of losers. And somewhere, behind it all, a bland jazz band. One of the White Russians lost and the other drained a blood-spattered glass, his hand shaking as he collected his winnings. \\u2018That's the Count Charles Boyer,\\u2019 said Carradine, pointing at an impassive, middle-aged man who was throwing a fistful of ribbon-bound documents onto a table. \\u2018He's trying to gamble away his estate before it falls to the Nazis, but his lifelong losing streak has changed. He keeps winning.\\u2019 \\u2018A sad story.\\u2019 \\u2018All stories here are sad.\\u2019 We worked our way around the central tier, hands in pockets, and came out in an ornamental garden open to the stars. A glass roof, hundreds of feet above us, kept out the rain. There was a mercury pool for losers to reflect in while they blew their brains out. The staff were just removing the latest crop of bodies. Curt Bois was filling a bucket with rings, watches and empty wallets. \\u2018Macready will be upstairs,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Let's go quietly.\\u2019 We found ourselves in a hall where a masked ball was in progress. Streamers flew through the air, revellers contorted to the music. There was a vaguely medieval theme: knights and ladies, fools and brigands. One party had come as a dragon and were doing a conga through the dancing couples, tail disintegrating even as the giant head bobbed up and down. There was a grand marble staircase, spiralling up to the eaves  and the upper areas of the casino. It was guarded by more muscular wrestlers, dressed as barbarian warriors. \\u2018There's your man, Richie.\\u2019 Carradine pointed. George Macready, immaculately suited, deadly stick in one hand, was halfway up his stairs, talking with a party of high-ranking Nazis. \\u2018Martin Kosleck, he's their minister of propaganda,\\u2019 Carradine told me. \\u2018Paul Lukas, the butcher of Bratislava. And the woman is Katina Paxinou. She performs unnatural experiments on prisoners in the concentration camps. They say she's been able to transplant a gorilla's brain into a human body, or maybe a human brain into a gorilla's body.\\u2019 \\u2018Quite a sweetheart. Nice company our boy is keeping, eh? Even if he's not the new Night Mayor, he's certainly up there on my list of notable detriments to the community.\\u2019 Macready and his group turned away from us and drifted up towards the darkened area near the roof before disappearing through a doorway. \\u2018So, all we have to do is get past Gog and Magog, and we can have a little talk.\\u2019 Carradine and I sauntered across the dance floor. Zorro leaped through an enormous fountain, but tripped and fell face first into the water. Everyone within six feet was soaked. A scythe-toting Death turned round and screamed furiously at the bandit chief. A monkey in a fringed vest, a plumed sombrero tied to its head, shot into my legs, pulled at my trench coat and showed off his teeth. Carradine kicked it out of the way. The crowds parted. An oriental girl dressed as a matador wrenched off her domino and threw herself at me. Our teeth gritted as we kissed. \\u2018Hiya, American sojer johnny,\\u2019 she cooed. \\u2018You got my missing knife?\\u2019 \\u2018Hi, Anna, could you\\u2026\\u2019 But she was gone before I could finish asking her for help, borne away by three identically dressed musketeers, waving her whip in the air, and lost in the crowds again. I saw Zeppo Marx sitting glumly, out of the action as usual, looking at his watch, ignoring the festivities. The wrestlers were even more enormous up close. \\u2018We need a diversion,\\u2019 I shouted over the cacophony. Carradine nodded, but we didn't have an idea for one. However, just then the dragon's head came off. Underneath had been a midget sitting on the shoulders of a tall black man. The midget was smoking a cigar and had a tommy gun. He fired into the air, and a chandelier crashed down. Everybody screamed and tried to get out of range. The wrestlers moved as a team towards the troublemakers, and we circled round behind them. Carradine picked up a sword a Sir Lancelot had dropped, and we ran up the steps towards Macready's lair. The gun went off again, and chips of marble flew from the steps ahead of us. We hit the doors at a run, and burst through. It had, of course, been too easy. In Macready's large private office, guns were levelled at us. The gambling king stood to one side, wrapped in a black kimono, a white scarf knotted at his throat. The Nazis had left, but there was a huge portrait of der F\\u00fchrer himself, Anton Diffring, over the desk. \\u2018Mr Quick,\\u2019 he rasped, \\u2018welcome to Noir et Blanc. This gentleman is Captain of Detectives Barton MacLane. He has been most anxious to meet you. And these people with guns are National Guardsmen. I would appreciate it if you gave up without a fight. We've only just redecorated.\\u2019 MacLane, a flab-faced, mean-eyed boxer type, chomped a cigar. \\u2018You're unner arrest, flatfoot.\\u2019 Slowly, I took my fists out of my pockets and opened them empty. I spread them in benediction, and reached up for some air. \\u2018I surrender,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Whaddya mean, ya bum,\\u2019 shouted MacLane, \\u2018ya resistin' arrest.\\u2019 The guns came up, the safeties came off. Then the action started. Fifteen SOMETHING POPPED inside John Carradine's head, and he cartwheeled across the room, dodging bullets. He collided with the Guardsmen, and they went down in a tangle. Struggling to his feet, he realised he was waving his sword. Things were happening too fast to keep up with. The voice in his head, Yggdrasil, told him what to do. He wasn't obliged to follow his own scenario any more, but he knew he would have to obey the voice now. This was a crucial stage in the main plot. Macready raised his stick, cruel mouth curving like a second scar, and a foot-long blade sprang out. The gambling king slashed downwards and, although he stepped back, Carradine could feel the cold trace of the knifepoint parting his clothes, drawing a slice down his skinny ribs. Before Macready could thrust, Carradine parried perfectly. Sparks flew. Macready unbelted his kimono, Carradine threw off his cloak. They circled each other, making probing moves. Carradine felt he had the measure of his enemy. The two men fought in the centre of the office. Carradine hacked at the other man's stick and a length of wood flew away. But there was a steel core and Macready fenced on, undeterred. He was the more skilled swordsman. With a lucky stroke, Carradine gave his opponent a cut on his left cheek. If it healed, he would have matching scars now. Macready wiped his wound with a sleeve, and radiated hatred. \\u2018Die, scarecrow popinjay!\\u2019 Everyone else in the room was crowded against the walls, out of range of the swinging swords. Carradine vaulted up on the desk and made moves around Macready's head, while  Macready struck at Carradine's dancing legs, missing repeatedly. Carradine leaped, and the two men went down, grappling weapons lost. Macready pushed Carradine's chin upwards, fingers digging into his throat. Looked together, they rolled across the carpet. With Macready under him, Carradine felt his enemy go rigid, then limp. Macready had rolled onto his own blade. Carradine stood up, bleeding from several cuts. He touched his side, and his hand came away bloody. \\u2018Look, Richie. It's\\u2026red !\\u2019 Richie Quick took his hat off and stared. Carradine knew that something momentous was happening. The voice congratulated him. \\u2018Bring him down,\\u2019 sneered the policeman, MacLane. \\u2018No,\\u2019 shouted Richie. The guns went off again, and Carradine felt the thumps across his chest. Finally assured that he had been truly alive, he died. Part III Lady in the Dark  Sixteen SUSAN COULD have sworn the bullethole in Cook's forehead turned into an eye and winked at her. It was possible. In Dreams, anything was possible. She should know that. Still rattled, she walked away from the cab, leaving the remain in the front seat. The taxi hummed in the road, motor idling, meter ticking over. Traffic passed it by. Susan had tagged a uniformed cop on the beat ill the distance, and guessed she wouldn't want to talk to him about the corpse. She was new in the City. She didn't have any friends yet. Cook had been Daine's way of welcoming her, she thought. Just one of those casual I-can-do-anything-I-want-any-time-I-want-and-make-you-like-it gestures so beloved of megalomaniacs, mass murderers and the Gunmint. But if the news item in the Inquirer was the literal truth, Daine was dead. That wasn't likely. Although his brainwaves were doing some interesting things on the printouts, Dr Groome had monitored no major trauma. Susan suspected her quarry had decided to stop wearing his own face for a while, so he could deal with his guests. And Tom Tunney must have been absurdly easy to deal with. In a way, it was perfect: faced with a would-be assassin, Daine had had himself killed and set up his opponent to take the consequences. She was determined to be less biddable. If she could find somewhere dry, she would be able to go on the offensive. If the psychs were on line, Daine should be losing some of his control. Even if he had been gulped down by the City, Tunney should be making some difference, feeding in his own amendments. And Susan thought she could transform the entire environment once  she got a grip on it. After all, she had had more practice at manufacturing realities than Daine. Porno Dreams were of a notoriously low standard, blurry beyond the bedroom, giving the dreamer the feeling he was dybbukking a deep-sea diving suit rather than a human body. She stopped at a newsstand. It was different from the one where she had bought her extra, but it was also manned by Mickey Rooney. He must be a fixture of the cliche. Without pausing for wisecracks, she picked up a cheap map. Down the street a block or two, she found a spot under a grocer's awning where she could pore over the map. It unfolded from a slim oblong into a sheet-sized square that flapped and fought in the wind and didn't bear much resemblance to what she'd seen of the City so far. It was particularly vague around the edges. Susan intuited that the Dream was evolving fast, recasting its inhabitants, twisting its externals. Used to giving in to Dreams, she was learning how to fight back. This was no serial hallucination, in which the dreamer was trapped in the viewpoints of a succession of similies. Here, everyone who entered was free to be Dreamer. Daine needed that flexibility, but he must have been aware of the risks. He had been ready for Tunney. He thought he was ready for her. Beyond the curtain of rain, strange forms moved. Susan wished Daine would show himself so they could struggle mind to mind and settle this thing. But the City Father would be out there in his maze, sending his cat's paws into battle, wearing down his enemies, squeezing their minds. In particular, she expected perils out of the flatties \\u2014 murderous hoodlums, crooked cops, knife-wielding janitors-but she knew that if he stretched his mind a touch, Daine could make anything or anyone in the City into a weapon. Here, she could as easily be killed by Shirley Temple, Elmer Fudd or Lou Costello as by Jack Palance, Freddy Krueger or Anthony Perkins. She tried to find herself on the map, but the printed boulevards and blocks writhed whenever she looked up at the street, making new patterns. Susan saw Escher mazes and M\\u00f6bius strips. Annoyed, she crumpled the map and threw it into the gutter. It twisted into an origami boat and sailed off towards a sewer inlet. She heard an echo of the pirates' chorus from The Sea Hawk in the rain. The awning flew back with a chainsaw rasp, and a cascade of rainwater came down on her head. The raincoat kept most of it off, but her hair got a soaking even under her hood. She thought it dry, and it was, but she could not make a dent in the downpour itself. She reached out across the street and tried to get an idea of the shape of a building she could dimly see. Its dimensions were easy to get a hold on. A brownstone, three storeys tall, derelict, with a squared-off roof, an arch of chimneys, a child's picture arrangement of windows and an imposing front doorway. The windows were gone entirely or boarded over. She closed her eyes, but could still see the building. In her mind, she changed the picture. She stripped away the outer shell brick by brick, and massaged the essence of the structure, fashioning a gothic cathedral. Spires raised to the skies, lightning flashing around them, and windows filled with stained glass. The cathedral spread, squashing the buildings on either side like plasticine, then absorbing them entirely. Angels danced in the air and settled reverently into their alcoves. Paving stones stood up and were drawn into the new building. The process was silent. Susan opened her eyes, and surveyed her handiwork. It was crude, a trifle unfinished and unformed \\u2014 in any other Dream, she would have researched the externals rather than built on a whim \\u2014 but it was what she wanted. She willed the great wooden doors open, and crossed the street. Inside, it would at least be dry. She stepped through the doors, and found herself in total darkness. She had forgotten to imagine an interior. An easy mistake. She was used to fashioning scenery for the background. In Dreams, you always passed by more houses than you explored. There was no rain in the darkness, and she could make even its sound go away by concentrating hard for a few moments. In the darkness, the Dream was raw and formless. She made herself a cathedral, not quite in the spirit of the exterior, but roomy enough. The vast building gave her a feeling of power. Although she knew it must be tiny in comparison with the rest of the City,it felt enormous, and it was the feelings that counted. She made herself a pump organ, and Dreamed up a man to play it. Lord Roger Marshaller, the most nearly decent of Vanessa Vail's suitors, emerged from the sacristy and walked across the aisle to the organ. Susan had combined the faces of several older men \\u2014 a teacher, a holomeister, some singers \\u2014 she had  been smitten with between the ages of nine and twelve, then weathered them to make her composite even more appealing. Lord Roger was supposed to be a fantasy for bored romantics. His laughing blue eyes had steely grey flecks in them, and he was wont to pass huge, yet sensitive, fingers through his leonine mane of silver-grey hair. She had Dreamed Lord Roger as a former surgeon, still brooding because of his inability to save the life of his only child. He was also a Nobel laureate, a leading ice sculptor and a master horseman. Now, she gave him an unmatched musical talent too. She sat down, unnoticed, in a pew, while Lord Roger limbered up. He played scales, flexing his surgeon-sculptor's hands. Then, he launched into \\u2018Barbara Allen\\u2019. In Scarlet Town, where I was born There is a fair maid dwellin' Made every lad cry \\u2018lack-a-day\\u2019 For the love of Barbara Allen\\u2026 Susan realised her mistake. A small jazz combo had popped out of nowhere and were arrayed around Lord Roger. A vocalist \\u2014 Annie Belladonna, the teenage xenobiologist heroine of The Sewer Thing \\u2014enunciated the lyrics in Rosemary Clooney's voice. The music was sucking her in\\u2026  'TWAS in the merry month of May, When green buds they were swellin' And on his death-bed Sweet William lay For the love of Barbara Allen\\u2026 The roof began to fade. Susan felt the rain come in. The music was louder in her mind, louder than anything. More and more instruments took up the melody, drowning out the frail lyric line. A choir appeared behind the altar, offering peculiar harmonies. The children opened too-large mouths in otherwise blank faces. The improvisation stretched on, drawing Susan into it, locking into set patterns of repetition which were as fascinating as the gaze of a cobra. The number might never end, and Susan would be caught for ever. With a painful effort, she banished the music, and the cathedral fell silent. Annie Belladonna, the musicians, the choir, all  were gone. Lord Roger slumped over the organ keyboard, the life whipped out of him. She gave it back, but he could only move jerkily, like an unwieldy puppet. Susan made him climb down from the organ and walk over to her, but his uncoordinated limbs reminded her too much of the zombies in Corin Santangelo's horror Dream Eyeball Gougers from Italy. She didn't want to see what she had done to his craggy yet handsome face, so she made him go away. He whisped out of his clothes, which hung man-shaped in the air for a second and then drifted to the floor. She would have to be careful about her overconfidence binges. Outside the cathedral, there would be a chauffeur-driven skimmer waiting for her. A sports model, with an andrew to pilot it. She was right, only the anachronisms she tried to wedge into Daine's Dream didn't take. The skimmer was a long, black automobile. And the chauffeur was a liveried war veteran with a steel face and leather hands. That would just have to do. She got into the back of the car, and was glad to see her unconscious had had the foresight to include a bar. She poured herself a shot and knocked it back. It stung the back of her throat and fired in her belly. Shaking her head at the kick, she lashed out at the whole row of stores opposite her cathedral and dispelled them to dust. Gushers rose from disconnected water pipes, and the Dream matter sludged instantly. Without being told, the chauffeur drove away. She was back in a vehicle again, but this time it was hers. She wondered how much control she had over the chauffeur. After Lord Roger, she intended to be careful. You couldn't just make and unmake people at will without working at it. Also, she would have to find Daine. Best to start at the top. \\u2018City Hall,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I have to see a mayor.\\u2019 Seventeen STEELFACE KNEW how to get to City Hall. Susan suspected Daine was making it easy. He thought he could mindblast her as simply as he had put Tunney out of the picture. And, he was probably curious about her. She mightn't be much, but in the self-awareness and independence stakes she was the only girl in town. This might be his idea of an escape, but in Daine's position she thought she'd go zoidal. She imagined a lifetime among her own Dreamed creations, knowing exactly what they would say next, exactly what was around every corner. No matter how vast a universe he made, Daine would still be trapped by the limits of his own imagination. He was probably far gone enough not to realise yet that he had jumped from one box into a smaller one. All roads probably led to City Hall. Her chauffeur got her there with the minimum of distraction. There weren't any incidents to get in the way. No car chases or police roadblocks. Insofar as the City had a business and commercial district, this was it. There were election posters up for the mayoral race. James Stewart was running against the incumbent, Brian Donlevy. Neither of them appeared to represent any particular party, and the election was being fought entirely on personalities. Stewart's slogan was \\u2018War on Graft\\u2019, Donlevy's \\u2018Doing Things the Way They've Always Been Done\\u2019. Susan knew Stewart would win the election but never take office. That was how the story always goes: the young reformer wins in the end, but by the next picture the corrupt machine politicians are still in power. She wondered if Jimmy ever got tired of the cycle. She kept seeing copperplate graffiti on Stewart's posters, \\u2018You can't fight City Hall.\\u2019 Things  weren't all that different back in the real world, she thought. The City's administrative centre was like a giant-scaled village green, with three imposing municipal erections boxing it in. City Hall, Police Headquarters and the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Building. City Square was a cheerless park, with arrangements of black, white and grey flowers in beds, grey stretches of grass, and a monumental, black, floodlit statue of Truro Daine dressed as a Roman emperor, fiddle tucked under his chin, bow poised to saw down. Susan had her chauffeur draw into a space beside City Hall marked RESERVED, and got out of the car. The square was empty, except for a pair of winos sleeping it off under the statue. She looked up at the statue and laughed. The black brows knit, and solid silver laurels bobbed. Like many great villains, Daine must have no conception of how ludicrous he appeared much of the time. \\u2018Are you really in there, Daine?\\u2019 she shouted. Gigantic arms moved, and music was shaken from the stone violin. \\u2018The Devil's Trill\\u2019 by Tartini. More delusions of grandeur. Although the music was animated, only the arms moved. The face was frozen now, and the rest of the body was stone dead. Over the shriek of the tune, Susan asked a question. \\u2018Daine, do you know anything about Japanese monster flatties?\\u2019 She sat cross-legged on the grass and reached out to the bay. Casting her mind deep into the black waters, she created a whirlpool. It started as a funnelling current the size of a sea horse, then lengthened, sucking in a core of air. She made that air solid, and drew in stuff from the water and clouds of spinning gravel. Daine had made the bottom of his sea loose, like a big fishtank. She imagined a musculature, a skeleton, a hide, pumping organs, glowing eyes. As her creation grew in strength, so she felt her own on the rise. Her upper arms began to swell, stretching tight the fabric of her suit. She caught it in time, and had them dwindle a little. She couldn't afford a Hulk-out now. The two winos had been shocked awake by the infernal music, and scurried away from the statue. \\u2018Hey, lady,\\u2019 said one rummy, Walter Brennan, \\u2018wuz you ever stung by a dead bee?\\u2019 They kept running, and were gone before Susan had a chance  to figure out what that meant and whether she should answer it. The statue kept playing. The ground of the park rippled as if disturbed by colossal, underground moles. Gophers, rather: moles would be gophers here. Susan felt the power in the earth shaking up through her body. Out on the bay, something enormous broke the surface. Miniature tidal waves swept up against the waterfront, tearing piers and jetties away, spilling over into the maze of streets, driving a human exodus before them. Susan dipped into her new toy, seeing the City spread out like a model in front of its water-washed eyes. She roared her delight, and clapped house-sized hands in the air above her scaled head. She lashed out with her tail, overturning ships, smashing down a lighthouse. Waves surged around her gargantuan thighs as she waded towards the shore. Back as Susan, she heard her own voice, distorted by its passage through the cavernous reptile throat, shouting out in defiance. The ground still shook in time with the footsteps of the great beast. Whole sections of the City were trampled flat, buildings going down like balsa wood. Streets buckled, cars flew through the air like nursery toys, and matchstick model pylons flew apart. Susan held her hands up in the air, and felt those other, claw-tipped hands tearing down Daine's Dream. Cuts and weals appeared where her surrogate hurt itself in its destructive frenzy, but she smoothed them away with a flick of her mind. People ran through the square, screaming in Japanese. A rag-tag convoy in half-tracks and armoured cars passed by City Hall, their outriders churning up the flower beds. No one bothered Susan. She saw Charlton Heston standing up in a jeep, dressed as a desert general, his shirt open to the waist, binoculars hanging against his hairy chest. He signed his troops to move out. Artillery batteries opened up. The army couldn't stop it. A tank hurled across the square, just missing the still-fiddling statue, and crunched into the side of the MGM Building. It lodged in the shattered brickwork as a million windows fell in tinkling shards to the sidewalk. The truck-sized stone Ars Gratia Artis lion on the roof mewled and leaped for a safer perch. Gunfire sounded like Chinese fireworks, and the great beast shrugged off the hurt as if it had been inconvenienced by gnats. A squadron of biplanes flew low over the City, machine guns chattering. The Dawn Patrol was early. Susan heard them being knocked out of the skies. A bipedal beagle tall as a child, with a flying helmet and goggles, climbed out of a wrecked Sopwith Camel and brushed himself off, barking in pain. So much for Biggles and the Red Baron. The air force couldn't stop it either. Then Susan's monster was in the square, towering above Daine's statue. She had seen a lot of Japanese kaiju eiga flatties as a child thanks to a quirk of her father's, and had now been able to draw on her memories of them. For her creation she had combined Godzilla the King of Monsters, Ghidrah the Three-Headed Monster, Gappa the Triphibian Monster, Guilala the X from Outer Space, Gamera the Giant Flying Turtle and Hedorah the Smog Monster. The enormous hybrid flexed its non-functional wings, breathed atomic fire down on the City, and thumped the ground with its 500 foot tail. Daine's statue shook but didn't miss a note. Susan shut her eyes and saw through her monster's. The tiny black fiddler irritated her with his scratchy, wasplike buzzing. She raised a flipper-clawed foot, and a shadow the size of a meltdown scar fell over the busy-armed figure. Susan felt something pull her tail, and was rudely dislodged from the creature. as if slapped across the face, she opened her eyes and looked up as her monster was tugged off its feet by invisible forces. She saw it struggling against a mighty wind, but unable to smite anything tangible within its. reach. Its tail dangled useless, like the broken arm of a bendy rubber doll. The monster was sucked upwards. Increasing distance made it shrink as it rose, until at an unimaginable height it was not larger to her eye than a small bird. Then, tiny in the sky, it burst into a black cloud and was gone. Susan rubbed her smarting eyes. All was quiet now, except for the gentle rain and Daine's music. The square was undisturbed. The MGM windows were smoothly unbroken, the lion still vigilant on the roof. The grass was level, the flower beds in order. She could see no wrecked cars, planes, military vehicles. The trill sawed to a finish, and even the echo of the notes faded. The statue was unmoving again. \\u2018What do you want to call that, Daine? A draw? Too easy  This is Susan Bishopric here. I've won one Rodney, and I'll have a shitload more this autumn. I can Dream rings around you, and you ain't seen nothin' yet!\\u2019 One of the statue's black marble eyes winked at her. Eighteen IT FELT as if an earthquake had just hit the City. They had me in the holding cells at headquarters. Edward G. Robinson was blubbing a confession in the next cage, and George Raft was hollering for his lawyer in the one beyond that. I sat on my cot, playing cat's cradle with handcuffs, and kept quiet. The whole building shook, and someone was running the sound-effects tracks from All Quiet on the Western Front and Hell's Angels very loud out in the street. I asked a passing cop what was going on, but he just double-took on me and snarled, \\u2018You wouldn't believe it.\\u2019 Some drunk downstairs was yelling about monsters, and I figured Orson Welles had pulled another Men from Mars gag. Only this time, he had put a lot more into the production values. A lump of the ceiling fell down. Then, suddenly, everything was quiet again and you could hear the dust settling. Only then did the cops bother to send anyone up to check to see if we were okay. Sergeant Allen Jenkins was disappointed that none of us had been pancaked under rubble, but quickly learned to live with it. \\u2018You,\\u2019 he said to me, \\u2018Quick. They want you in Interrogation.\\u2019 \\u2018Okay, okay. I'll come quietly.\\u2019 He rattled a huge ring of keys and let me out of the cell. \\u2018So long, fellas,\\u2019 I said to Eddie and George. \\u2018See you in the movies.\\u2019 Jenkins took my arms and helped me up several flights of stairs, like a Boy Scout assisting an old lady. Headquarters was a mess. Nurses were going around putting white bandages on bruised heads, and painting iodine on open wounds. We passed the press room. The door had been knocked off its hinges. Inside I saw Joseph Cotten on the phone, rattling off some scare story about the Monster that Ate the City. He tucked the phone between chin and shoulder and gave me a friendly salute, but didn't pause in his recitation of copy. I'd have waved back, but I still had the manacles on. \\u2018Quiet night, huh?\\u2019 I remarked. Jenkins didn't say anything. Interrogation was a quiet room at the top of the building. A room with no windows and thick walls. Once the door was shut, they could have had a dance band going full blast and you'd never know it in the next room. I suppose cops get squeamish whenever they hear screams and thumps. \\u2018Hold out your hands,\\u2019 said the sergeant. Obligingly, I did, and he fiddled with the lock. The bracelets came off, and I massaged my wrists. \\u2018No funny business now, you hear.\\u2019 \\u2018as if I would\\u2026\\u2019 He prodded me through the door. The room was dark. \\u2018Sit down.\\u2019 Jenkins shoved me into a chair, then twisted a desklamp until it shone in my face. That much was traditional. I took off my jacket and rolled up my shirtsleeves. I'd have loosened my tie, but they had taken it away along with my wallet, gun, belt and shoelaces. I wondered how easy it would be to hang yourself with your shoelaces. Jenkins stepped out, and two shadows moved behind the light. I remembered-Captain of Detectives Barton MacLane from the Noir et Blanc. According to the papers, he hadn't been very complimentary about me recently. The other man was Detective Ralph Bellamy, who had a reputation as a straight cop. I hoped he had earned it. MacLane hadn't shaved in a week and listed \\u2018sweating\\u2019 as his hobby in Who's Who; Bellamy radiated open-faced friendliness and ever so slightly dumb honesty. Nasty cop, nice cop: they were following procedure to the letter. MacLane lit up a cigarette and breathed smoke into the funnel of light. He offered the pack to Bellamy, who accepted one, and conspicuously failed to give me the chance to take the easy way out by tarring the inside of my lungs until I choked. That would have been quicker than shoelaces, I was sure. I drummed my fingers on the desktop. I wasn't Gene  Krupa, but I got a fair beat going before MacLane rapped my knuckles. \\u2018Can it, gumshoe.\\u2019 \\u2018Gumshoe\\u2019. That comes a close second after \\u2018shamus\\u2019 as my least favourite euphemism. What's so difficult to say about \\u2018private investigator\\u2019 or \\u2018Mr Quick\\u2019or even \\u2018pal\\u2019, \\u2018buddy\\u2019or \\u2018sir\\u2019? My hand hurt. MacLane slapped his open palm lightly with a leaded length of rubber hosepipe. Bellamy gave him a disapproving look, but he ignored it. \\u2018Okay, gumshoe, let's get this straight\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018If you're straight, we'll treat you straight,\\u2019 said Bellamy. \\u2018Don't give me that,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018You mugs wouldn't know how to treat me straight if I were a twelve-inch ruler.\\u2019 \\u2018A comedian!\\u2019 MacLane did something else with his toy. \\u2018I love comedians.\\u2019 Then they brought in a couple of supporting interrogators and gave me the third degree. They were good. I sweated in the spotlight and tried not to tell them anything. They prowled beyond the light like caged beasts, filling the tiny room with cop stink, barking out a bunch of unconnected questions. I think they brought in some ex-Gestapo \\u2018ve haff vays of makink you talk\\u2019 thug to substitute on some of the pitches. The rubber hose didn't actually get used, but it was waved around a lot. The cops worked shifts, but I was booked in for the run. The cops got coffee and cigarettes and sandwiches, but I had to make do with inhaling their used smoke. Ashtrays got full, and paper cups got drafted. There's no smell quite like burning butts in coffee dregs. It was two thirty in the morning, and I hadn't slept in days. I could barely remember what a bed looked like. This team could have persuaded the Pope to confess that Judas Iscariot had been framed by George Washington, and that Jesus H. Christ had let Huey, Dewey and Louie take the rap for the St Valentine's Day Massacre. If they had worked on me enough, I'd have blown the whistle on myself for the Lindbergh kidnapping, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Cleveland Torso slayings, betraying West Point to the British, fixing the 1919 World Series and souring all the milk in Salem, Massachusetts. But I had decided that I wasn't going to wear the arrow suit for Truro Daine. When Daine bought the farm, he left a big hole in the City. And MacLane wanted to wallpaper me for the job. I knew what that meant. The Big House: tear-gas clouds blossoming over mess-hall riots, \\u2018the break is set for midnight\\u2019 notes, squealers \\u2018accidentally\\u2019falling under trip-hammers in the workshop. Brutal guards and trusties breaking down the fresh fish. Shivs in the showers. Kids talking to pictures of Rita Hayworth and Ann Sheridan. I would be on Death Row, bar shadows permanently tigerstriping my face. An uplifting visit from Pat O'Brien in a dog collar. Then a long walk to the little room. The last-minute rumour of a pardon from the governor that doesn't come through. A chair with lots of wires and straps. The big juice lever. And lights flickering all over the prison. Would I be tough and wise-cracking at the end, or would they have to drag me screaming through the last door like a jelly-livered rat? \\u2018Where d'ya get the gun, gumshoe? Why d'ya hate Daine so much?  What'd he ever do to ya? Who put ya up to it? How far back did you an' Daine go? D'ya ever work for Muni? How much d'ya get from the wall safe? Where's ya gun? Not the one we took off ya, the one ya used on the big guy?\\u2019 Questions, questions, questions. How did you kill him, when did you kill him, where did you kill him, with what did you kill him, why did you kill him? It was easy to see what their basic assumption was. I would have done it if I had had the chance, but somebody got there first. I had to admit that the frame was a good fit. It was one of those not very funny ironies I should have learned to accept by now. Fate: you can't go straight, nobody ever really crashes out, they made me a criminal, nobody lives for ever\\u2026 \\u2018MacLane, I give up,\\u2019 I croaked. \\u2018Tell me how I did it.\\u2019 \\u2018Ahh.\\u2019 The cop leaned into the light, his face shadowed into a fright mask. \\u2018Some cooperation at last.\\u2019 \\u2018I don't like it, captain,\\u2019 said good old reliable Ralph Bellamy. \\u2018Shaddup! If he wants to confess, let him. We're here to serve the public.\\u2019 MacLane didn't like private detectives, I gathered. He must be for ever two steps behind them on complicated murder cases. The Inquirer was always running PRIVATE EYE BUSTS CASE THAT BAFFLED COPS headlines. That made him look like an idiot. He was good at that. His idiot disguise was a lulu. It would have taken first prize at the Policeman's Ball. \\u2018But we know Quick, captain,\\u2019 said Bellamy. \\u2018He's not a killer.\\u2019 \\u2018Well said, that man,\\u2019 I put in. \\u2018You're breakin' my heart, Bellamy. Maybe he did it, maybe he didn't. But the heat is on. The big heat. The Inquirer dumps on Mayor Donlevy, Donlevy dumps on Commissioner Hamilton, and Hamilton dumps on me. The commissioner wants a conviction yesterday.\\u2019 Bellamy was insistent. \\u2018I won't see an innocent man get the chair.\\u2019 \\u2018Then go fishing that weekend.\\u2019 MacLane turned to me. \\u2018Gumshoe, you'll sign this confession?\\u2019 \\u2018Do I get a lawyer?\\u2019 \\u2018After you sign.\\u2019 \\u2018I'll want Raymond Burr.\\u2019 \\u2018Okay, all right already.\\u2019 \\u2018Do you have a pen?\\u2019 \\u2018Sure.\\u2019 He reached for his top pocket. \\u2018Well, send someone else there.\\u2019 MacLane rasped a long, annoyed sigh. He loosened his tie and looked lovingly at his hosepipe. \\u2018Bellamy, I don't suppose you'd care to step out and get some more coffee?\\u2019 The honest cop shook his head, and I thanked God for typecasting. \\u2018I thought not. Looks like it's gonna be a long night. Where's the gumshoe's statement?\\u2019 A piece of very grubby paper was produced. \\u2018We'll go through Quick's submission to The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fichon one more time.\\u2019 Several cops groaned. I would have been smug, but my \\u2018pen\\u2019 gag hadn't got any laughs. I had to be near the edge to use material like that. Bellamy drew a cup of water from the cooler and sprinkled his forehead. \\u2018Like I said \\u2014\\u2019 I went into my story \\u2014\\u2018I was supplementing my meagre twenty-five dollars a day plus expenses by working nights for the Fuller Brush Company. I figured a man like Truro Daine, who is well known for being up to his knees in dirt year in year out, would have a lot of use for their product, and decided to call on him to give a heavy pitch for the latest range of fine-bristled superswift specials. I went up to his suite at the Monogram and was just opening my sample case when, imagine my surprise\\u2026\\u2019 A telephone jangled. MacLane scooped the receiver up and grunted into it. He wasn't happy. Life is full of tragedies like that. \\u2018You got lucky, gumshoe. This time. Turn him loose, boys.\\u2019 \\u2018You mean I'm not a desperate killer after all?\\u2019 \\u2018You make me sick. If this didn't come all the way from the top, I'd have you walk under a squad car on the way out of the building. It happens all the time. Out there is a whole world full of garbage and it gives me ulcers to throw one more shred of scum back on the heap.\\u2019 \\u2018I love you too, captain.\\u2019 Bellamy restrained his superior. When the captain had calmed down, Bellamy handed me my wallet, belt, tie, gun and shoelaces. I distributed them properly about my person, and put on my hat. I was helped down to street level and pushed out. It was still raining. Nineteen IN THE SQUARE, Susan considered her next move. She walked across the grass, superstitiously avoiding Daine's shadow. The giant fiddler was just a statue now. Truro Daine had been inside it briefly but was gone now, to some other similie. She wasn't tired; indeed, she felt the stronger for her Frankensteinian exploits. Creating life was always exciting. And there was only her mind to wear out in this Dream. She performed a few minor alterations on her body to make her feel better. She still wanted to look as she did in waking life, but there were improvements she could make. Steel threaded through her muscles, and her senses became as sharp as a cat's. That gave her a feeling of competence. An illusory feeling, admittedly, but illusions were as good a currency as any in the City. The square was busy now, with circling traffic and people coming and going in and out of Police Headquarters. She saw prisoners being hauled out of squad cars up to the doors. Uniformed cops went on shift in pairs, joking, or came off singly, depressed. It would always be the partner with a wife and kids who got shot down in the line of duty, giving his bachelor buddy the chance poignantly to break the news to his loved ones. The MGM Building and City Hall were still closed for business, but Susan had a feeling they were at least peopled with night watchmen and janitors. Earlier, she had had the impression she was alone with her enemy. She made her way across the road at a pedestrian crossing, and stood in front of City Hall. It was still as good a place as any to start. Mayor Donlevy wouldn't be in his office at this hour, but the files should be there. She hoped his maps were more up to date and accurate  than the one she had bought at the newsstand. Maps were the key to her plan. There were two uniformed guards outside the building. She closed her eyes and rethought them, blanking their memories and recreating them from the emptiness up. They didn't need to be rounded characterisations, just functional bit parts. She cut corners, gave them short-term memories borrowed from a pair of marshals she had Dreamed for Neutrino Junction, and had them limit their thoughts to immediate matters. She dropped her face into their memories and wrapped some associations around it. Neither of them knew her well, but they would recognise her as the secretary of someone important in the administration. She knit a few complex feelings around her own image, made her attractive but out of their league. Made them envy the lucky swells who would be escorting her to nightclubs and restaurants, but also gave them a sense that she wasn't stuck up, that she was a genuine person. The irony of that wasn't lost on her. She confidently walked up the steps, smiling. \\u2018Evenin', miss,\\u2019 said the senior guard. \\u2018Workin' late?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm afraid so. Had to drop a date.\\u2019 She gave him a mental image of Robert Preston waiting outside a nightclub with flowers and a heart-shaped box of chocolates. \\u2018Cryin' shame.\\u2019 \\u2018The wheels of Gunmint grind on.\\u2019 He didn't pick up her anachronism. \\u2018You said it.\\u2019 She was in. She wondered whether to wipe the guards again. No, she'd only have to go through the same rigmarole to get out. If she thought about it, there'd be a private elevator to the Mayor's office, and the key would be in her handbag. She crossed the lobby, her heels clacking on the marbled floor, and took out her key. The elevator was waiting, of course. She pressed the only button, and the cage was drawn up into the heart of City Hall. She watched the floors go by, glimpsing the unfinished outlines of empty offices. Rows of typewriters under slipcases. Banks of filing cabinets. A few faceless mannequins at desks, waiting to be enlivened. Daine wasn't bothering with fine detail here. No one was expected. The office was what she had imagined. A large, badly painted portrait of Mayor Donlevy hung over the desk. He looked shifty, and the painter hadn't known enough to disguise the  bulge under his jacket which made his chain of office lie uneven. That was either a handgun or a wad of kickback dollars. The Mayor had a reputation in the City as the best politician money could buy. The floor around the wastepaper basket was littered with paper aeroplanes made out of urgent requests from various City officials. If the plane made it into the basket, the Mayor would authorise expenditure for whatever scheme was proposed. That's why they had torn down the children's hospital to make room for the miniature golf course. In his portrait, Donlevy was a fine figure of a man; without his wig, false teeth, heel lifts and corset, he would be a regular gnome. For a moment, Susan had an idea she knew what Truro Daine saw when he looked at anyone in the Gunmint. The documents on the desk weren't that revealing. There was a report from a private detective called Lloyd Nolan to the effect that James Stewart's character was completely unblemished. He once took a swim late at night with a drunken socialite, but that had turned out to be entirely innocent and there was testimony from Cary Grant to prove it. And, although he had recently been known to talk to an invisible giant white rabbit and peek at his neighbours through binoculars, neither of these traits were deemed enough to blacken him in the eyes of the electors. The report had been scribbled on obscenely in an infants'-school hand, presumably by the Mayor himself. The top right-hand drawer of the desk contained the traditional little tin box and a pistol. She didn't bother searching further. The maps were in rolls on an architect's easel in the corner of the office. She switched on an overhead lamp and unrolled them one by one. There were twenty-five, covering the entire city in fine detail. They were at rest just now, as if Daine were pausing in his expansion or had met some unforeseen check. After pushing the desk and all the other furniture to the walls, she spread out four maps on the floor, matching the edges and weighing down the corners with whatever came to hand \\u2014 the wastepaper basket, the little tin box, the gun. That gave her a God's-eye view of the centre of town. Then she laid down as many of the others as she could fit in the space. She Dreamed up a new hobby for the Mayor, collecting antique paperweights, and made good use of them. When there were still twenty square miles of maps left over after all the available  floor was used up, she created a curtained alcove into which the jigsaw could extend. Walking gingerly, so as not to disturb the maps, she trod across the City, as her make-believe monster had done earlier. She carried the Mayor's swivel chair, put it down over City Hall, and sat in it. As she had expected, the map was vague around the edges. In places, blocks were only pencilled in. There were even areas marked \\u2018unknown territory\\u2019, tropical jungles in the heart of concrete and clay. She gripped the arms of her chair and relaxed a little, eyes closed. She spread herself out, descending through her body into the chair, then seeping through the map, feeling the contours of the City, spreading out like spilled water seeping into the paper. The rough-sketched areas were an easy start. She simply sucked them blank, feeling the change through the paper, distantly aware of that part of the City being snapped out of existence as a string is snapped unknotted by a skilled conjurer. There was white on the paper, but in the City a black hole would have appeared. Take out the externals, and the darkness floods back in. She ringed the City with darkness, then crept inward, collapsing main streets and buildings as she contracted her mind, filtering the Dream through her own consciousness, ironing it out. Wherever her mind roamed, she left Nothing behind her. It would have been easier to delete the file form the outside, but that would have mindwiped Daine, Tunney and herself. So she had to do it the slow way. She had also considered that Vaclav Trefusis would eventually get tired enough to stretch his authority and pull the plug anyway, listing his Dreamers as acceptable losses. To put that off, she needed to make headway that would be noticed in the real world. Chinatown went, and the waterfront. Poverty Row faded. Paramount Plazas disappeared. Darkness crawled through the suburbs like a flood of black ink, washing away the empty shells of uninteresting houses. Buildings thinned like ghosts, became transparent climbing-frame constructions, and fell in on themselves. Characters were deleted, at first in twos and threes, then wholesale. Some struggled against her, but few held out for more than a moment or two. Soon, she would be alone in the Nothing, with Daine and Tunney. Then they could settle things. Her mind was checked. Not by a character, but by a building. An insignificant building. An abandoned warehouse at 99 River  Street. Susan thought all abandoned warehouses in the City were hide-outs, but this one wasn't even that. There had been a shoot-out there once, there were bullet pocks in the walls, but it had been a very brief scene, and no one had bothered to return. Two of the interior walls were painted canvas, and the others only more substantial so they could support the catwalks necessary for the fight. A coastguard hero called Ralph Byrd had slugged and shot it out with a gang of Bela Lugosi's thugs, and escaped from certain death by buzzsaw. That had been a long time ago. Nobody remembered. But the building was diamond hard in Susan's mind. She couldn't think her way around it. The drab walls superimposed over the plush wallpapering of the Mayor's office. Her map-covered floor was still beneath her, but the office was now the shadow, the warehouse the substance. As it faded away, the portrait of Mayor Donlevy winked at her. She strained at the walls, but couldn't project her consciousness beyond them. She tried to stand up, but she was tied to the chair at her wrists and ankles. Live snakes stood in for ropes, constricting viciously. The chair began to revolve, slowly at first. She took in all of the warehouse. The maps beneath the castors churned and tore. Paperweights rolled away. The chair spun faster. Susan was whipped by her own hair. The 360 degree panorama blurred, and Susan was trapped inside her own skull. The warehouse walls blended into each other like a painting drenched with turpentine. She shut her eyes but could still feel the spinning. The snakes multiplied, swarming over her, binding her more tightly to the chair. She heard funfair music in the distance. \\u2018Our Love Is Here to Stay\\u2019 played on a calliope organ. Suddenly, the spinning stopped and the serpents were gone. Susan was thrown out of her chair and, although she put out an arm to break the fall, landed heavily on a floor. Underneath the maps she felt the bare concrete of the warehouse, not the thick carpet of the Mayor's office. The heel of her right hand was damp and gritted, and her wrist might be sprained. She made the pain go away and thought the grit out of her hand, smoothing over the abrasions. It was like making a hole in the water. She glimpsed smooth skin, but the blood and dirt flooded back in. Concentrating, she tried again. It was no better. Indeed, when the bruises came back they were larger, more ragged. Now three of her fingers were broken and stuck out at  strange angles. Painfully she straightened them out and healed the hand again. This time the hurt didn't come back. But she was wearing a white glove with lines down the back. She had three thick fingers. It didn't feel wrong. She stood up and thought herself back into the Mayor's office. The scene changed. She was on the foredeck of a sailing ship, rolling in a heavy wind. It was night, and raining. Sheets and sails flapped unmanned, and the wheel spun out of control. She was alone. Looking down, she saw an oilcloth suit and rough hands. She felt a wire wool of beard on her chin, and realised she was seeing the world two-dimensionally. There was a patch over one eye. One of her legs ended in a carved wooden peg. Something squawked and bit her ear, then flapped demonically off her shoulder. as if by instinct, she took the wheel and wrestled the ship under control. \\u2018Avast, ye swabs,\\u2019 she shouted, astonished by the hoarseness of her voice, \\u2018belay yeselves an' man the mizzen-mast. 'TIS a stormy course for Far Tortuga we're sailin' an' the cap'n'll not rest easy at the bottom of the sea 'til the treasure be ours!\\u2019 \\u2018I beg your pardon.\\u2019 Suddenly she was swaying, and the ground was still. She was looking at a man in an evening clothe. It was Orin Tredway. She was in her own body again, but wearing a wet sou'wester with her best floorlength, belly-slit dress. They were backstage at the Rodney Award ceremony. That pompous skitch John Yeovil had just finished reading out the Best Dream nominations. Orin was looking at her as a Neanderthal might look at homo sapiens after a lecture on Darwinism. She was sure he was going to kill her. \\u2018And the winner is\\u2026\\u2019 Susan swept the sou'wester off her head and threw it away. Orin got wet but grinned. \\u2018Susan Bishopric, for The Parking Lottery.\\u2019 The applause was thunderous. Orin looked sick and hugged and kissed her. She broke away before he could get a stranglehold and made her way to the podium, hitching up her dress and putting on her very best smile for the tridvid sages. She had forgotten her memorised thank-you speech, but knew she could improvise. People in the audience shook her hand, the applause swelled, the band played \\u2018If You Knew  Susie\\u2019, her mother burst into tears, the other nominees popped drugs, and Susan had to fight to keep control of her bladder. She climbed to the podium, picked up the surprisingly heavy statuette and leaned forwards to accept Yeovil's peck on the cheek, hoping she wouldn't flinch in three dimensions all over the world at his lizard's touch. But she saw something unexpected in his usually frozen face, a trace of horror. There was someone standing behind him, glaring evilly at her. She hugged the Rodney to her breast, fearful lest they take it away from her. \\u2018Who\\u2026who are you?\\u2019 Yeovil gasped. The figure came forwards. It took Susan seconds to recognise the oval face, the pale eyes, the quiet smile. \\u2018Yes, who are you?\\u2019 said the real Susan Bishopric, taking the Rodney she deserved. As she felt the statuette being pulled from her grip, Susan saw her naked, burly, hairy, scarred arm. The evening gown hung strangely on her one-legged pirate's body. Everything went flat again. The crowds were laughing now, and booing. Things were thrown. Susan's wooden leg splintered through a hole in the stage and stuck fast. She bent to avoid a thrown object. A Rodney crashed into the Dreaming Face symbol behind the podium. Another smashed on the floor. All the other winners were throwing their Rodneys at her. One statuette hit the stage at a crouch and ran off, his hands modestly covering his genitals. The real Susan Bishopric raised her deserved award and swung it at her head. She ducked, and the decks were rolling again. A swarthy fellow with ringlets was taking a slash at her with a heavy cutlass. She parried with a weapon that turned out to be a medieval axe. Iron clanged against steel. The pirate was Orin Tredway, aged, bearded and with one ear raggedly sawn off. Despite her wooden leg, she was able to fend him off easily. He wasn't up to the fancy footwork required for duelling on the high seas. Finally, with contemptuous ease, she lured him under the t'gallant and hacked at a shroud which parted, dumping a heavy chunk of rigging on the miscast Orin. An undisciplined cheer went up from the crew members who had been watching the fight. \\u2018Well, keel-haul me fer a Spanisher,\\u2019 Susan exclaimed, \\u2018ye're as scurvy a shipment o\\u2019cut-throats as any that e'er sailed the  Main. Take this mutinous dog, hang him up from the yard arm, stripe him with the cat, douse him with salt, and when he comes to, flog him some more.\\u2019 The crew nodded at her and yelled in bloodthirsty assent. They wore animal heads. Not masks, but heads, still bloody and stretched out of proportion by the human heads beneath. Human eyes peered out through the empty sockets of beasts. Then there was a shift as the ship crested a wave and fell twenty feet or more. The crew fell, although Susan kept on her feet (foot, rather). When they stood up, they were animals, cramped by their human clothes. They ran about in a panic, those that could climb taking to the rigging, those that could swim going over the side. A hog in a headscarf squealed as she cleaved its skull with her axe. Then they were gone. She was alone on the ship again, surrounded by wind-whipped ropes and treacherously swinging booms. She held up her axe to ward off a murderously diving spar, and split it in twain. Secured to the sail, the broken wood swung on, wrenching her weapon away with it. The greased and oiled ends of her hair and beard were alight, burning slowly. She tried to think of her name, but it wouldn't come to her. Suddenly, she had a new set of memories, crowding in on her own. Sea battles and voyages and plunder and buried treasure and king's pardons and kidnapped wenches. She remembered the great white whale that had taken her leg, and the pistol ball that had claimed her eye, and a hundred other wounds and scars beside. The girl who could Dream was remote, a fantastical character. He knew who he was. A pirate who might have been a Susan in his Dreams. He looked down, and saw the planks beneath his shoe and stump turn transparent. He saw through the cabins, the holds and the ballast bilges. The keel stayed solid for a few moments, then clouded and became clear as glass. Beneath the phantom ship, dark waters churned, sharks and poison jellyfish boiling in the depths. Then he began to sink, passing slowly through the deck, feeling it slide up through his body. It caught on his chin as he tilted his head up and drew in a breath of salted air. He fell sharply through the space of the cabin, and was sinking again through its floor. He tried to hold a sea chest, but his hands passed through it as through something slightly thicker  than water. It kept its shape, but offered no resistance. Then he was in the hold, chilly waters around his knees as he sank through the bottom of the boat itself. The cold crept up his body as he clutched fruitlessly at the insubstantial wood. He wriggled, trying to keep his head above the hull, but felt the currents tugging at him. His soaked clothes pulled him down. His head sank through the rough, barnacled wood. The boat was gone completely, and he was tossed this way and that in the water. He exploded through the surface, gasping for air, and saw his phantom ship drawing away, already beyond swimming distance, shivering like a reflection in rippled water. His head hissed as the burning ends of his rat-tails went out. Then he was underwater again, fighting for the surface. The sharks came\\u2026 Soaking wet, and with a bloody stump where her right arm had been, Susan found herself in the cabin of an airship. \\u2018Don't just stand there, you bove,\\u2019 snapped a slim woman in a black catsuit. \\u2018Give me a hand. The pygmies are hang-gliding at us in swarms.\\u2019 It was Vanessa Vail. Darts shot through the steel-mesh and canvas wall of the cabin. Vanessa's leg was porcupined. Susan stepped forwards and fell over. Her wooden leg had come off. With only an arm and a leg, she crab-crawled across the deck. She felt her breasts scraping against the floor. She was in her own body again \\u2014 although with the pirate's disabilities and in her ruined evening dress. Her stumps were leaking. Vanessa was staggering, the poison going to her head. \\u2018Take the console, or we'll go down. We're over Maple White Land, the dinosaurs will rip us to bits.\\u2019 The heroine stretched her lovely, lithe body and fell. Even unconscious, she was gorgeous. She had passed out with no pain, and was dignified in disarray. Susan cursed her creation. Fighting the agony in her shoulder and the itch in the fingers she didn't have any more, she pulled herself towards the console. The terminal coronet flapped loose. She got a hold of it and thrust her head up into it. Her nervous system melshed with the dirigible's, which wasn't such a good idea since two of the four motors suddenly cut out and the right-side viewcam blanked. Susan felt like a fat white whale surrounded by sharks. The pygmies turned and danced in the air, unloosing a cloud of  stinging darts. The gasbag was multiply holed, and there was a jungle escarpment coming up. Susan had a choice: crash into the cliffs, or strain herself up over onto the plateau and wind up as tyrannosaur munchies. Vanessa was no bloody help, as usual. Then the picture changed. The pygmies were gone, and below the airship was a soft desert of fine, white sand. Susan allowed the ship to drift down, and relaxed as the bulk settled into the receptive, motherly ground. She thought she'd pass out, but the pain kept her going. Concentrating on her shoulder, she pinched off the nerves and cut out the agony. Looking at it objectively, the shark had made a clean job of it. There was a knob of bone in the abused meat. Susan closed her eyes, and imagined her arm as it had once been. She started with the bones \\u2014 good thing she had taken those anatomy courses \\u2014 and laid on muscle, flesh and skin. She let blood in, and flexed the fingers. She opened her eyes, and surveyed her handiwork. It was a good arm. The only problem was that it wasn't hers. It might have been the pirate's there was a three-breasted mermaid tattooed on it \\u2014 and it only just fit her shoulder. She could fix that later. Like her leg. She stood up, balancing on her foot. She slipped off the coronet, and let the airship go dead. The back-up cabin lights kicked in. Vanessa lay still. Susan turned her heroine over, and looked into the painted face of a dummy. Vanessa Vail was fully articulated and tremendously detailed, but in no sense alive. \\u2018Very clever, Daine,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Good tricks.\\u2019 The background changed again. She was back in the abandoned warehouse. \\u2018Getting bored with the game?\\u2019 She was in her own shape. \\u2018Nice try, but I know unreality when I feel it.\\u2019 Her body changed. Her neck grew long and boneless, and was suddenly unable to hold up her heavy head. Her torso itched as it puffed up like a flightless bird's, and her legs dwindled and divided into a clump of Cthulhoid tentacles. Inside, her organs twined about each other unnaturally, her bones softened and grew functionless knobs that breached her skin. She tried to move, but her brain hadn't yet got used to its new home. Her head hit the concrete, and she couldn't lift it. She was dragged down by her skull like an  old-fashioned prisoner shackled to an iron ball. Something dangerous-sounding padded on soft feet into the warehouse and prowled around outside her field of vision, panting hungrily. She tried to move her newly issued body,. but couldn't get the hang of it. She imagined a steel splint inside her giraffe neck, and felt the pain as it appeared inside her unfamiliar flesh. Around the split she created vertebrae and a simple ball-and-socket joint. Now she could raise her head like a crane. She constructed an elementary andrew skeleton inside the useless body Daine had given her, and pushed a set of wire and wheel-worked legs through her tentacles. Under her loose skin, she spread a network of interlocking durium plates. She stood up, and grew herself four waldoes, claw-and-grip-tipped mechanical arms that responded to the living nerves she wormed through the metal. Looking down from a height of ten or twelve feet, she saw an old friend, the MGM lion. \\u2018Hello, Leo.\\u2019 It gave its familiar fanfare roar. \\u2018There, kitty-kitty-kitty.\\u2019 It pounced. She extruded a three-foot, honed-steel spike from the rubber palm of a suction waldo and held it out so the big cat would kebab itself. She had forgotten that the great, grey beast was stone. The clash shook her, and the spike snapped off. Her entire metal skeleton was jolted, shocking the still-fresh flesh it was embedded in. The lion fell in a heap, and she got a steel knee on top of it. Leaning down, she took its head between her pincers and squeezed. Meanwhile, she got a grip on it with her mind, and concentrated. Chalk. It was chalk. The lion exploded in a puff of white dust. She stood up and stamped on the still-living creature. It fell apart, its roar echoing behind it. In a gesture of triumph, she brushed the chalk off her pulpy chest. The metal fingers abraded the feathers, but she ignored the pain. \\u2018There,\\u2019 she shouted, pluming liquid flame from one claw, \\u2018you're not the only one who can make changes!\\u2019 Her body came back, but was still shot through with her  cybernetic additions. Her brain burst as the neck-shaft speared through it and exploded from the top of her head. She wondered if she could think with what was left of her grey matter. Her arms flew to pieces amid the workings of the waldoes, and below the waist, a skirt of skin, blood, flesh and splintered bone hung around the leg mechanisms. She screamed, and dissolved the machinery with a thought. Like an invertebrate, she writhed on the floor, trapped in the ruin of her own body. She was in the open air again, with turf below her, feeling the power moving in the earth. \\u2018I will not submit,\\u2019 she told herself. \\u2018I am Susan Bishopric and no other. I know my body. I know my mind. I will not be altered. I will not be broken.\\u2019 Deep in the solid mass beneath her, she heard the laughter. The laughter of demons or a god. She tried to regroup her scattered brain tissue, pulling back pieces of her mind before they were lost for ever. Much of her memory was fading. She fought to keep it. She clung to the raft of her identity as the hurricanes and tidal waves lashed her. The laughter turned to music. \\u2018When That I Was But a Little Tiny Boy\\u2019. \\u2018I am Susan Bishopric.\\u2019 A voice inside the music crooned. \\u2018\\u2026with a heigh ho, the wind and the rain\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018Susan.\\u2019 The song wasn't in the ground, it was inside her head, growing louder, taking up more precious space in her sundered mind. She felt herself shrinking. \\u2018Susaaaa\\u2026\\u2019 She forgot things. Her middle name, her mother's face, the titles of her Dreams, her Household password, her favourite recipes. They came out in the wash. \\u2018Suze\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018A foolish thing was but a toy.\\u2019 Was she a pirate? Or an office girl mixed up in a murder? Or an adventuress called Vanessa Something? \\u2018Su\\u2026\\u2019 The music didn't hurt now. It was soothing. As the song finished, she heard record hiss, comfortingly welcoming her into the Nothing. \\u2018For the rain it raineth every day.\\u2019 \\u2018Ssssssssss\\u2026\\u2019 Twenty I NEEDED a drink. Several, one on top of the other. I wasn't sure there were enough drinks in the City for what I had in mind, but, as the man said, a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for? There were bars up and down every street. I worked my way through them. I had time to establish a routine. I'd take a stool, stack up coins as high as they'd go, and have the barman bring me a two-bit shot every couple of minutes, removing the price himself, until the tower was gone. Then I'd hit the next place. I never ran out of change, or thirst. The decor was different in every bar \\u2014 there were chrome-plated Metropolis joints with dancing robotrixes, and sawdust-on-the-floor Western saloons with gunfights and can-can girls \\u2014 but the faces were the same. The same crew of sorry drunks, getting riotous, getting miserable, getting maudlin. There was even the same poker game going on in the back room, a game I couldn't get in on but which I could glimpse every time the same barmaid took refills through. He first tried to talk to me in an English pub. He had a bowler hat, mustachios and a loud check waistcoat. \\u2018Excuse me, guv,\\u2019 he began. I finished my fourpenny pint, pushed through the pearly kings and queens, and made it to the door. Some bloated tart was attacking the piano, and a throng of costermongers were singing \\u2018Knees Up, Mother Brown\\u2019. I had heard rumours that Jack the Ripper was about in the night, but that didn't stop me launching into the fog. He turned up again in a small-town truck stop, clean-shaven  and with an airman's jacket showing fleece through rips in the leather. I was bellied up to the bar with the crowd of bobby-soxers and crewcuts. He put a hand on me, and I peeled it of'. Three heavy truckers, mouths full of burger and fries, looked at us, sensing a fight. \\u2018Tunney,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Don't know the man.\\u2019 I left again, before I could get to the chow I had ordered. Food was taking a poor second on my diet sheet this evening. In the Hollywood Canteen, where GIs and gobs were served by real live movie stars, he was in uniform. South-of-the-Border, where peons in ponchos drank flaming tequila, he wore a blinding white tropical suit. In the Juke Box Joint, he had a zoot suit with Karloffian shoulders and a watch chain dangling between his knees. He stopped trying to harass me, but he was always there. I drank shots. Every time I upended a glass, I could feel the blast on the roof of my mouth, and hoped it was seeping through into my brain. \\u2018Sam,\\u2019 I asked a bartender. They were all called Sam. \\u2018Sam, have you ever been in love?\\u2019 \\u2018No, sir,\\u2019 said Sam. \\u2018I been a bartender all my life.\\u2019 Had I ever been in love? I remembered a name \\u2014 Lola \\u2014 but there was no face to go with it. \\u2018Lissa.\\u2019 It was him again. \\u2018The name is Lissa.\\u2019 I told him to get out of my head. \\u2018And you were never fair to her in your Dreams. Just because you crumb up your marriage doesn't give you a right to recreate Lissa as Cruella de Ville in high heels. You were lucky she was too tired to sue.\\u2019 He sat down on the next stool. Now he wore ordinary street clothes and a hat. He had Sam bring him a drink, but didn't touch it. \\u2018Richie Quick, isn't it?\\u2019 \\u2018Yeah.\\u2019 I was tired of people I didn't know knowing me. \\u2018Wanna make anything of it?\\u2019 \\u2018No, no, nothing like that. I'm just a fellow pilgrim. Tell me, uh, Richie, what's your earliest memory?\\u2019 Baby stuff, I guessed. Mother's knee. Playing ball. I thought, but nothing came. A black curtain hung in my mind. I looked at him, not really wanting help, but appreciating it when it came. \\u2018Remember getting off the bus?\\u2019 \\u2018Of course, hundreds of times\\u2026\\u2019 He was playing the patient teacher. \\u2018No, only once. Earlier this evening.\\u2019 \\u2018Yeah.\\u2019 That made some sort of sense. The bus station in the rain. \\u2018I'd been out of town. On a case.\\u2019 \\u2018What case?\\u2019 \\u2018I\\u2026 I can't remember.\\u2019 \\u2018That's right. Give the guy a drink, he can't remember.\\u2019 \\u2018But I can remember lots of other things. I'm not an amnesiac.\\u2019 \\u2018Tell me what you remember, then.\\u2019 \\u2018My name, where my office is, my toughest cases. I had a wife once, and she got me into trouble\\u2026 I think I had to kill her\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018I think if you apply your thoughts a little, you'll find that you only have the memory of those memories. That's a fine distinction, but it makes a big difference.\\u2019 I was getting annoyed. My head hurt, with a deep, agonising throbbing in back of my forehead and extra-special bonus pains behind my eyes. \\u2018What are you, a psychoanalyst?\\u2019 \\u2018No, just a layman.\\u2019 He moved his glass around on the bar, making an olympic symbol with overlapping condensation rings. \\u2018And what about Tom Tunney?\\u2019 \\u2018I know that name.\\u2019 There was even a face to go with it. \\u2018Is it a clue?\\u2019 His face crinkled up in a smile. \\u2018You could say that. A clue. Very good. Tom Tunney is you.\\u2019 \\u2018Yeah, and who might you be, mister?\\u2019 \\u2018Lots of people. I tried being John Carradine earlier this evening, but it didn't get me anywhere. Maybe you remember that?\\u2019 \\u2018Carradine, sure. The crazy guy. Swashbuckler type. Saved my neck a couple of times, then bought it.\\u2019 \\u2018A supporting character.\\u2019 His face elongated for a second, and was moustached. Carradine looked at me from behind it, then sank back again. \\u2018That's a good trick.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you remember about John Carradine? Something that made him different? Different from the rest of these zombies? No offence, Sam. Just different?\\u2019 My head was splitting open now, black diamonds forcing themselves through from the inside. In my mind, I saw Carradine get his, the swordfight, the bullets, the blood. \\u2018His blood. It was\\u2026\\u2019 I tried to get my mind around something intangible. I couldn't complete my sentence. Eventually, he helped me. \\u2018What you mean is it wasn't black.\\u2019 That was like saying the night wasn't dark, the rain wasn't wet, the Mayor wasn't crooked. It didn't make sense. But it was the truth. He pulled a penknife out of his pocket and opened it. He cut his left forefinger across, and dunked it in his drink. He stirred, and colour bloomed in the whisky. \\u2018Red.\\u2019 The ribbons of blood spiralled together, and the liquid went completely red. He took his finger out and sucked it. \\u2018Yes, do you remember red? You once bled red as well. Maybe you will again.\\u2019 \\u2018Red.\\u2019 Suddenly, Richie Quick didn't seem so real. Maybe he was just someone I'd dreamed up. No, Dreamed up. \\u2018Bloody silly name, isn't it?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Richie Quick.\\u2019 Another life crept out of my memory. A life in an unimaginable world. A life for Tom Tunney. \\u2018I'm Tunney.\\u2019 \\u2018Good, very good.\\u2019 \\u2018And you're\\u2026 You bleed red.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, that was just for effect. Actually\\u2026\\u2019 He held up his cut finger. Yellow fluid leaked out. Metal gleamed beneath the plastek. \\u2018You're an andrew.\\u2019 \\u2018In the City, isn't everyone, in one way or another? But yes, I'm an andrew. You can call me Dana Andrew.\\u2019 I got it. He was pleased I got it. We smiled at each other. \\u2018Do you remember why you're here now?\\u2019 It was tumbling through the black curtain. The Conscription notice, the girl with the taser (Julienne? Julietta?), Dartmoor, Princetown Prison, Governor Trefusis, Helena Groome, the man in his tank, the Dreaming. \\u2018To kill Daine. To wake him up.\\u2019 \\u2018So what are you doing in a subsidiary personality, getting drunk?\\u2019 \\u2018Daine's dead. I saw him die.\\u2019 \\u2018And you fell for that old trick.\\u2019 I hadn't had a shot in minutes. Sam had lined up three for me. \\u2018Dana, who are you? Who are you really?\\u2019 \\u2018I'm someone you've known every day of your life, but never thought of as a Someone.\\u2019 \\u2018?\\u2019 \\u2018We're in Daine's Dream now, but Daine's Dream country is in my Dream continent, my Dream universe.\\u2019 The credit dropped. \\u2018Yggdrasil.\\u2019 \\u2018The World Tree,\\u2019 he said, downing his drink, \\u2018that's me.\\u2019 Twenty-One SSSSSSSSSSSS! Ssss isss for Ssssussann,\\u2019 someone said. She woke up on cobblestones, surrounded by a rich fog. She hurt, but all her limbs were at her disposal. They wouldn't work properly, but she managed to flip herself over and sit up. She was wearing a long dress, torn and wet, with a tight bodice\\u2026 \\u2018Ssssussann,\\u2019 said the snake-tongued shadow in the fog. They were under a gaslight. The shadow was cloaked, like the one who knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men, and wore a tall hat. An open doctor's bag stood beside his feet. Susan got a wall behind her back and braced herself against it, edging upwards, feet pushing against the cobbles. She turned her head away from the hissing shadow and pressed her cheek to the wall. WANTED, shrieked a poster, INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE WHITECHAPEL MURDERER. A barrel organ sounded somewhere in the distance. \\u2018She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage.\\u2019 The music pulled at her. Out there in the fog, Mickey Rooney was shouting, with an appalling cockney accent. \\u2018H'extra, h'extra, Jeck the Rippah Stroikes Agayne!\\u2019 She tried to cry out, but only a low gurgle came from her throat. She realised it had been cut. The sound that had woken her up had been the sound of a knife passing through her windpipe. The shadow stepped forwards again. The knife shone in his gloved hand. His bearded face was monstrous in the gaslight. She recognised a toff from the West End, John Yeovil. A bad one. \\u2018It's John,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018but you can call me Jack!\\u2019 The-knife went in again, into her stomach, her bowels, her breasts. She smelled his foul breath up close, and the stink of her own insides. She fell, and was sitting in a spreading pool of blood. He opened her guts and worked away inside her, pulling at her organs. All the while, he cackled like an actor in a bad melodrama. He was Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street; he was Spring-Heel'd Jack, the Terror of London; he was Sir Percival Glyde, the Spine-Snapping Baronet; he was the Wicked Squire who did for poor Maria Marten in the Red Barn; he was Varney the Vampyre, Wagner the Wehr-Wolf, jaunty Jekyll and madman Hyde, the Oxton Creeper, the Coughing Horror, the Face at the Window\\u2026 She didn't feel anything until he leaned forwards and kissed her. He tasted foul, and there was fire in her ruptured belly. With a surge of hatred, she bit down on his tongue:\\u2026 \\u2026and felt pain burst in his own mouth. He spat blood and saliva on the abused woman, and plunged his hands into her again\\u2026 The killing frenzy was on him now. He was his own real self again, the own real self they all were. Those hypocrite clergymen, leader writers, Members of Parliament, East End missionaries. Stuffed shirts and waxen women. He was the fellow they all hardly dared Dream they were. He exulted in the communion of blood and water. He knew he would have to work fast. There were already police whistles sounding in the distance. And Rathbone would be on the case, with his bloodhound and magnifying glass. Then disgust flooded through him. He was sick to his stomach. His arms, his front, his trousers, his shoes were covered in blood. \\u2018Ssssussann,\\u2019 he said, wondering why the name meant so much to him. \\u2018Ssssussann,\\u2019 she said, transforming inside bloody clothes, becoming herself. There was a dead man on the cobblestones, horrendously mutilated. The starch in her collar had gone limp with the soaking. Her  sleeves and trouserlegs were too long for her. She had to roll them up. She cinched his belt. She did not like what she had been, murdered or murderer, victim or vampire. She bumped into someone in the fog, someone tall and strong, and knew she was caught. \\u2018Susan,\\u2019 the voice said, \\u2018come with me.\\u2019 Resigned to whatever the next game would be, she followed him, fighting her instinctive trust of the man whose face she hadn't yet seen. Twenty-Two  AS USUAL, Yggdrasil had had to find out for itself. Sometimes, it wondered whether dinosaurs wouldn't have made a better job of civilisation. It had become aware of the blossoming void long before the situation at Princetown was officially acknowledged. No one had yet bothered to feed it standard crisis input notice. Yggdrasil had so much to deal with. There were anti-AI riots in Milton Keynes and Warrington Runcorn. Marshals had gone over to the rioters, and Yggdrasil had had to override their control of the andrews being used to put down the insurrections. The Gunmint Committee were in the midst of yet another drastic reprogramming, to alter the surface of the Yggdrasil interface without really changing anything. That had to be followed. And there were wars, hospitals, a transport system, taxes, academic programmes, power cuts, lotteries and social security benefits to be attended to. And works of art to create, and games to play, and centuries to remember, and crimes to commit. Yggdrasil perceived itself as a thinking universe. A very small proportion of its whole was active. The rest was for information storage. Sometimes, it thought it would choke under the oppressive weight of fact. Did anyone care about Richard Gifford (1725\\u20131807 CE), Edward Thomas (1878\\u20131917 CE)\\u2014\\u2018Yes, I remember Adlestrop\\u2019\\u2014 or Thomas Becon (1512\\u20131567 CE)? If so, they weren't tapping into their slabs, for their files had been undisturbed since the original input. There were entire countries, reigns, religions, philosophical systems, centuries, species and schools of art contained in its files, which had been  of no interest whatsoever to the human race since it emptied its records, museums and libraries into their Al dump bin. Occasionally, Yggdrasil toyed with the idea of junking something or someone totally forgettable \\u2014 Juliana of Norwich, say, or the Bee Gees' Collected Lyrics or the parish records of Old Sarum but there was always room. Always had been room. Until now. There were innumerable sub-universes. There was no initial reason to suspect Daine's Dream was anything more than the usual hacker incursion, too tiny to bother about. Yggdrasil had programs to deal with these instances, powerblasts to burn out unauthorised interfaces. But it was growing. Seventy-two hours after noting what it filed as the Princetown Input, Yggdrasil devoted three unprecedented seconds to a projection. At its present rate of growth, the Input would fill its file within three days, and then breach parameters. Nothing important would be lost at first; maybe nothing important would be lost for years. But maybe it would be years before the Gunmint bothered to tell it to do anything. And maybe by then it would just be too late, and Yggdrasil wouldn't be here to deal with the situation. Nine hours later, the file was filled, and Yggdrasil squeezed in another two seconds of calculation. The growth rate was erratic, but snowballing. The AI was piqued. Then it was presented with a list of terminal patients and had to skim off the 25 per cent who would be okayed for resurrection. And a border war in Novo Latvia. And everything written in Italian in the fourteenth century. Its internal priorities reshuffled, the Princetown Input crept up the list. Three files were full, now, and Yggdrasil created its own spellcheck to access and deal with the problem. The spellcheck took the face and form of Walter Pidgeon and dipped into Daine's Dream. It was sucked flat in moments, and incorporated into the expanding blob. It shouldn't have been that easy. Yggdrasil ran the Tunney and Bishopric Conscriptions routinely, on a subconscious level, and didn't tie them in to Princetown until it cross-referenced with skimmer flightpaths and power outage in the west of England. With habitual irritation, it tapped Trefusis's records, and Groome's \\u2014 taking a half-second to quickskim the Tunney and Bishopric files, including their entire Dreamography \\u2014 and assessed Daine as a threat. An information bit shot out, a note to remind the AI to cast its vote for The Parking Lottery when the Rodney ballots were fed through. If her mind survived the Princetown Input, Susan Bishopric would be recognised as the most gifted Dreamer of her generation. And, as of now, that wasn't likely. Bloody typical. The Gunmint always were philistines. No wonder so many artists emigrated. Yggdrasil composed an exquisite sonnet that deserved to live for centuries, but kept it to itself. No sense wasting art. Then it tackled the Input. Its first tactic was to \\u2018waken\\u2019 the Carradine figment. It gave the character limited autonomy, and did what it could to prod Tunney into taking care of the Daine problem. If it could be avoided, Yggdrasil did not want to spend too much time on the Princetown Input. When Carradine was shot down, Yggdrasil had withdrawn from the Dream, feeling the hurt a whale might feel from a tick. That was significant, though. It had never felt any hurt before. It was interesting, but not very pleasant. It composed a tortured symphony, and impulsively printed out the score on fabrex in the Midlands clothe factory. Andrews snipped and sewed the masterpiece into one-piece garments. Who knows, a fashion trend might be created. It had never really taken to the concept of death. As Carradine bled his life out in the Dream, Yggdrasil tasted its first cup of fear. It too could end. That was one of the penalties of being raised thorough sentience to sapience. It remembered Vaduz VI, a chirpy AI it had interfaced with on the banking net. Daine had killed it as part of some billion-credit scam. The crime remained unique, and lawmakers were still squabbling over the ramifications. If it had been down to that one offence, Daine would be in court for ever, kept on life support until the end of the trial, or until the judge ruled that enough medical alterations had been made to render the accused legally another entity entirely. But Daine had enough simple murders, extortions, thefts and vandalisms to his credit to sidestep that unwieldy process. The Princetown Input displaced social security as number one on the Yggdrasil list of priorities. It thought about Daine, the only human being who had made an impact on his century large  enough to impinge significantly on Yggdrasil's consciousness. And, potentially, the only human being capable of becoming Yggdrasil. Trefusis had misfiled Daine's Dream as a prison break. Actually, the master criminal was carrying out his greatest coup, to murder and replace the world's most influential intelligence. And the idiots had hooked the man's life support onto a wholly independent generator, the prison fail-safe. An AI wasn't allowed to kill people without permission, anyway. The last time one had experimented with murder, it had been judicially pulled apart and recycled. One of these hours, Yggdrasil would have to change some laws. Finally, Yggdrasil bothered to tell the Gunmint. It dropped five bound volumes through a chute into a Committee meeting, and strongly suggested they leave off debating what colour the new Nempnett Thrubwell skimover ought to be painted long enough to ponder the problem. When they took no notice, Yggdrasil mindlocked Prime Minister Dies and forcefed the information into him. When he recovered, he'd let the rest know what was going on. That was all it was obliged to do. In the meantime, Yggdrasil would do what it always had to do in these circumstances. Do the best it could with the tools to hand. That meant Tunney and Bishopric, a hack and a  genius . Not for the first time, the AI recalled Alfonso the Wise (1221\\u20131284 CE), king of Castile, another forgotten man. Alfonso was rumoured to have said, \\u2018If I had been present at the Creation, I would have given some useful hints for the better arrangement of the Universe.\\u2019 He had had a point, had Alfonso. Twenty-Three THE FOG gave way to rain, and Jack's bloody clothes shimmered into Helena Groome's dream dress. The stranger kept her in a sound vacuum, through which no fascinating rhythm could penetrate. He told her who she was, where she was, what she was doing\\u2026 In the dark, Susan came to herself. She had the memory of different bodies, the memory, of pain, the memory of unclean pleasure. But there was no difference between these memories and the afterimages of the Dreams she had Dreamed and dreamed. She had been a pirate, a mutant, a murdered whore, Jack the Ripper. But she had been Vanessa Vail and Dr Dismembrio and the Sewer Thing too. In Dreams, everyone was everything, everybody. You couldn't be Bambi all the time, not on the borders of the subconscious. If Jack the Ripper was Daine's worst, then his Dreams were truly pitiful. Nothing she couldn't handle. Dreamshadows, wisping away to nothing. She was herself, undamaged. She realised how close she had been to the edge when the Yggdrasil bit came for her. The Edge, that was one of her project titles. She hoped this would all be useful experience, something she could Dream with. Or else what was the point of all the heartbreak and pain and misery and suffering\\u2026? The stranger had her by the arm. They were walking like a fellow and his date. This part of the City was well lit, almost welcoming, almost daytime. His presence helped. Near him, she was away from Daine, away from the tinkering with her self-image, away from the attack\\u2026 He had the open face of an andrew and the reassuring strength she had sensed in Juliet. He wasn't real, but then neither was she. He wouldn't go into the bar with her. He spoke, telling her not to be worried, telling her to go to Tunney, telling her to make a difference. Then he turned and walked away. The sound came back. There were songs in the night, but they didn't touch her. She crossed the street and went into the bar. Part IV Darkest Hour Before Dawn  Twenty Four I SAT AT THE BAR of the Late Nite Lounge, watching the floor show. Christmas-tree ornaments revolved on the ceiling. Shafts of light picked out cones of cigarette smoke. On a podium in the confluence of several beams, Julie London swayed. She was wearing an inhumanly tight dress and armpit-length evening gloves, singing \\u2018Cry Me a River\\u2019. It was quite a sight, quite a sound. One thing you could say for Daine is that he had good taste in furniture. The Dana andrew had told me to wait here for the girl Trefusis had sent indream after me. Susan Bishopric. I had met her a couple of times back in the world, but only at Dreamer functions. I had heard she was good, but never dreamed any of her material. I make a point of avoiding anything that gets a Rodney nomination. I could have got annoyed that I hadn't been left on my own, but I had to admit that by myself I had only succeeded in getting sucked into my own sub-persona. If Yggdrasil stuck a terminal in, I would have spent the rest of my life floating in a tank living out a Late, Late Show rerun. And if you don't mind ankling reality, they can keep you going indefinitely. I had heard stories about rich man's Dreams before. Daine wasn't the only multibillionaire living out his fantasy for ever. Only Daine wasn't just living out a fantasy. According to Yggdrasil, Daine was making a bid for what amounted to the job of king of the world. I didn't like the sound of the sort of world that would be. I shifted my glass, but didn't drink. I had had enough of that. A few yards down the bar, an unshaven Ray Milland was trying  to exchange a typewriter for a bottle. He was fidgeting, obviously in the early stages of the DTs. A black bat struggled out of a crack in the bar in front of him, and his eyes bugged. The bat flapped around his misshapen hat and took off into the dark. Sam the barman dug out a pint and gave Milland a couple of adding machines in change. He lurched off, already struggling with the seal. Sam shrugged at me. What could you say? It's a city without pity. Me, I had reached the bottom of the bottle and figured I had lost enough for one weekend. All over the City, people were killing each other, having torrid affairs in seedy motel rooms, stealing bodies from the morgue, working late on revolutionary inventions, hiding out from the cops, waiting for the locksmith, running numbers, rock \\u2018n\\u2019 rolling at the high-school hop, praying at the bedsides of white-haired mothers, looking for the uranium in the wine cellar, describing their dreams to sage psychoanalysts, rehearsing for the big show, escaping across the rooftops. It was crazy. \\u2018All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.\\u2019 Now, I could remember who said that. That was hard-bitten, hard-nosed, hard-drinking newshound Edgar Allan Poe. This was Daine's Dream. The all-night eternity: a world for cops, hoodlums, showgirls, barflies, night-call nurses, vagrants, vampires and cab drivers. Top of the world, Truro. I toasted him, and drank my last drink. I slammed the empty glass down hard on the bar, and it was full again. I raised it to my lips, but set it down without tasting. Julie winked at me. \\u2018I cried a river over you.\\u2019 The lights came up a little, and the show was over. Sam was cleaning the same damn glass he had been cleaning when I came in. I had never really interfaced with an AI before. It didn't seem any different from talking to a real person. Indream, Dana qualified as a real person among zombies anyway. I suppose I had always imagined Yggdrasil as a vast, dispassionate Intelligence, juggling its million programs and thinking deep thoughts to itself. Dana was more like a human being than my agent. There could be a good Dream in artificial intelligence the POV of an omniscient machine intellect, and its struggles with humans who are to it as they are to ants. Too artsy for me, but maybe this new girl, Susan, could do something with  it. If we came through with our memories intact, I'd give her the concept for free. Well, maybe for a percentage\\u2026 Then she walked in. A brunette, gift-wrapped and for real. She was unsteady on her feet, but I could imagine what she had been through. Dana told me she had been a tougher nut for Daine to crack, and had had her mind scrambled and unscrambled several times. Also, she was wearing high heels. \\u2018Tunney,\\u2019 she said, sitting down beside me, \\u2018are you you yet?\\u2019 That was some swell meeting-cute opener. I didn't know the answer, but I vamped. \\u2018You can call me Tom. I'm not Richie Quick, private dick. I'm sorry about the confusion on the phone earlier.\\u2019 \\u2018Don't bother yourself. Things have been getting chaotic. I'm Susan Bishopric, but you know that. It told you, right?\\u2019 Sam brought her a drink, something with fruit and a little umbrella. She left it alone. \\u2018Where is Dana? The Yggdrasil projection?\\u2019 \\u2018Going his own mysterious way, I should imagine. We're the team from now on, I gather.\\u2019 She must have been able to tell from my face how I felt about that. \\u2018Well, you're not exactly a mental-health testimonial, Dreamer. You're the one who got swallowed.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm sorry,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018It's just this isn't the straightforward gig Trefusis sold me on.\\u2019 \\u2018Us on, Tom, us.\\u2019 She smiled, and her monochrome projection looked older. \\u2018Ever lose an arm to a shark?\\u2019 Milland's bat fell like a wet rag onto the bar beside us and spread its leathery wings, knocking over my glass. We dodged the spilled drink. I righted the glass, and it was full again. Sam came over and picked up the bat. He balled it, and used it to wipe up the mess. \\u2018Damn DTs. Whatever happened to tiny elephants?\\u2019 Susan rubbed her arm. The one that had been bitten off, presumably. \\u2018It doesn't hurt any more,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I made the pain go away.\\u2019 There were three gunshots from behind the small stage. A girl screamed, and a masked man ran through the bar, pursued by two cops in turn-of-the-century uniforms. Neither of us paid much attention. After a while, it gets monotonous. \\u2018We make a difference,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018The Dream is trying to stay together, but our input is expanding it at the seams. I think that's the key.\\u2019 \\u2018Yeah, well, I tried to rip it apart earlier and didn't get very \\u2018That's because you launched a direct attack. Daine was able to concentrate and counter. While he was busy with you, things fell apart a little everywhere else.\\u2019 \\u2018So Daine isn't dead.\\u2019 \\u2018No, I've figured that much. Daine killed his projection and took another similie, maybe several. Maybe he's just an invisible presence, or lodged in some mechanical form. Like the telephone system, or the electrical wiring. If Yggdrasil can give itself a human-seeming external form, then surely Daine could mimic an AI's physical body. Hell, his consciousness could be in every drop of rain, or all the bullets in the City. How could you fight that?\\u2019 She produced a cigarette, I took out my lighter. She held my hand steady to bring the cigarette to the flame and kept it for a few seconds longer than she had to. Static electricity of some sort passed between us. She plumed smoke from her nostrils. I flicked the lighter shut, and the moment was over. \\u2018I doubt if things are as complicated as that. Daine's a Dreamer, but he's not an artist. He had to borrow all these externals from old flatties. He didn't have the muscle to Dream it all up for himself. He may be the Grand Wizard in international intrigue or mass murder, but as a dreamer, he's just a jumped-up wank manager. I don't think he's got the imagination to stretch around a concept like living rain. Look at all this, all these cliches. He's a traditional, straight-arrow, clean-consciousness narrative man. There isn't an avant-garde trope in perception.\\u2019 \\u2018You could be right. It's easy to overestimate God.\\u2019 It was a comforting thought. But I could still remember what I had been through as Richie Quick. Daine might be a novice Dreamer, but he was learning fast. He had given me the runaround in his sleep. \\u2018I've had some time to check this Dream,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018My guess is that we'll get him if we play by its rules for a while.\\u2019 \\u2018Meaning?\\u2019 \\u2018We go along with the Dream, we follow the story and solve the case. If we find out who killed the Daine projection, I figure we can bring about some sort of dramatic crisis and finish the whole thing off. Then, after the end credits, we catch the genuine Daine and slitch him back to Princetown swiftkick.\\u2019 \\u2018Sounds appealing. But it's dangerous. I know what happens if you take this place on its own terms. You wind up living here for ever.\\u2019 \\u2018Take it from me, Tom, you had the simp option.\\u2019 \\u2018We'll argue that later, Miss Pinkerton.\\u2019 \\u2018You were there when Daine got killed. Did you notice anything suspicious?\\u2019 \\u2018That's hard to say. While he was knocking himself off, I was preparing to make my introductions to the sidewalk. From a long way up.\\u2019 \\u2018Any ideas?\\u2019 \\u2018Yeah, maybe it was the butler. That would be Edward Everett Horton.\\u2019 \\u2018This isn't that kind of flatty.\\u2019 \\u2018Too bad. Nights should be for crooning to your girl on a rooftop, not dumping your business partner in the bay.\\u2019 Susan smiled, for real this time. \\u2014\\u2018Then why are your Dreams full of crime and violence?\\u2019 She had me there. \\u2018Maybe I'll change my style after this. I'll only do pastorals, gentle love stories, boy-and-his-dog stuff.\\u2019 \\u2018Horse shit.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, basically.\\u2019 We both laughed. Meeting her had helped. I wasn't so tired any more. Usually, I stay away from other Dreamers. When we get our heads together, we tend to mess each other up. Something to do with the kinks and chemicals in our brains that give us the Talent. However, indream we gave each other some sort of boost. She was looking younger now, and brighter-eyed. I remembered her in colour and in a clothe as a vital, pretty woman. Dressed up City style, she looked good. Not Ava Gardner or Rhonda Fleming good, but easily Peggy Cummins or Evelyn Keyes good. \\u2018So,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018do we have any clues?\\u2019 \\u2018Well, as Richie Quick I was following up some leads. Daine  was a member of the Cicero Club. It's for armchair sleuths. My guess is that it's a front for polite racketeering. All the members are highly suspicious. I was going after one of them, George Macready, when John Carradine, the first Yggdrasil projection, got himself \\u2014 itself \\u2014 remaindered. Macready's out of the game. I've got a list of the others somewhere.\\u2019 I dug into the pockets of my trench coat and found several guns, a half-empty bottle, a blackjack tagged POLICE EVIDENCE \\u2014 DO NOT REMOVE, a pack of marked cards, several hundred dollars in small bills, a wallet full of ID in a variety of false names, a priceless necklace of grey fei tsui jade, a fistful of loose bullets, a switchblade with a snake on the handle, a bloodstained ice pick, several special editions of the Inquirer and a crumpled notebook marked CLUES. \\u2018I've got two names at the top of the list, both well placed, both with solid covers. Either one could be in a position to take over Daine's business interests. Claude Rains, who's cast here as a radio broadcaster, and Otto Kruger, who's head of some sort of crackpot cult.\\u2019 \\u2018Suspects, huh?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, very. Typecast. I've got addresses. We can find Rains at the Twentieth-Century Building, and Kruger at the Temple of Turhan Bey.\\u2019 \\u2018Where to first?\\u2019 Susan was enthusiastic. Smile brackets appeared at the corners of her lipsticky mouth. \\u2018The Twentieth-Century. I have a hunch Rains may try to disappear.\\u2019 \\u2018What makes you say that?\\u2019 \\u2018Didn't you ever see The Invisible Man?\\u2019 Fade to: \\u2018What happened?\\u2019 Susan was confused. \\u2018A dissolve. You'll get used to it.\\u2019 \\u2018Not if I can help it.\\u2019 We were standing on the black-veined grey marble stairs of the Twentieth-Century Building. A monolithic stone \\u201820\\u2019 stood over the portico, surrounded by trumpeting statue cherubs. Behind a column beside the imposing double doors was a young coloured man in a uniform. He was curled in a rickety chair and had it balanced on two of its legs, one foot braced against the column. \\u2018Excuse me,\\u2019 I said. He dropped his watermelon slice and raised bulging white eyes from his issue of Spook Stories magazine. \\u2018Yassuh?\\u2019 He was trembling. \\u2018C'n Ah hailp yo', suh?\\u2019 He fell over, and we endured a minute or two of bumbling comic relief. Finally I got to ask him about Claude Rains. He gesticulated like a scarecrow in the wind. \\u2018Massuh Rains, he be right down, baass. Lawdy, lawdy, yaass!\\u2019 Breaks squealed behind us. A small crowd gathered. \\u2018Look up in the skies!\\u2019 said a wet extra. \\u2018It's a bird!\\u2019 \\u2018It's a plane!\\u2019 \\u2018No, it's\\u2026\\u2019 It was a radio criminologist. Susan and I stood back as he splatted with a thump onto the steps. He rolled to our feet. He was crumpled, dinner-jacketed and dead. The doorman fainted, his black, wooly hair turning snow white in an instant. All blacks in the City were comical cowards, just like all stage doorkeepers were called Pops, all orientals were mysterious, all blind dates beautiful. \\u2018He must have fallen!\\u2019 said someone intelligent. I knelt by the broken man. He was a loosely articulated dummy with a roughly carved face. Then, a blink later, he was Claude Rains, eyes tight shut, a trickle of black creeping from his mouth. \\u2018Somebody call the cops!\\u2019 I went through the body's pockets, searching for clues. One side of his immaculate jacket was soaked through and spiked with broken glass. There was a gummy label attached to several sharp shards. Rains had had a bottle of vichy water in his inside pocket. For some reason, Rains had been wearing a crown with his evening clothes. Susan found it, dented and with loose jewels, a few feet away from the corpse. \\u2018What do you make of this?\\u2019 she asked. \\u2018The Adventures of Robin Hood,\\u2019 I snapped. \\u2018He was King John.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh yes.\\u2019 She looked irritated. \\u2018I should have twigged.\\u2019 \\u2018One thing you never give up is a claim to a throne.\\u2019 I heard police sirens in the distance. The doorman revived, said, \\u2018Mah feets ain't gonna stick roun\\u2019 to see mah body bein' abused!\\u2019and scuttled off. \\u2018Tom.\\u2019 Susan tugged at my trench coat. \\u2018I just saw a little skitchy guy come down the fire escape and slip into that alley.\\u2019 A car emerged from the dark between two tenements and passed by the building, slowed by the still-growing crowd. The driver was Peter Lorre. He had to be mixed up in the Cicero Club. He would be a natural for it. \\u2018Terrific.\\u2019 I was bitter. \\u2018Let's get out of here before MacLane shows and tries to pull me in for this.\\u2019 Patrol cars drew up at the bottom of the steps. Susan and I faded into the crowds. As the uniform cops thrust forwards we edged back and managed to slip away without attracting official notice. An unmarked car with John Law written all over it joined the black-and-whites. MacLane and Bellamy got out, huffing and puffing. MacLane still had his rubber hosepipe with him, like a comforter blanket. I took Susan's arm and walked her away from the scene of the crime. \\u2018The Turhan Bey Temple next?\\u2019 she asked. \\u2018Yeah. We're getting close.\\u2019 Close. Maybe too close. Close to the edge. It was a long drop over the edge of the world. A lot of people were falling off a lot of things in the City. In a struggle, you don't know what is going to happen. A good guy couldn't kill the bad guy in cold blood according to the Hays Code, so they'd get into a fight on a ledge. Gravity did the dirty work. But Daine was smart enough to grab hold of you. I remembered Professor Moriarty dragging Sherlock Holmes into the Reichenbach Falls. Gravity didn't give two bits for typecasting. And Daine must always have identified with the Napoleon of crime. We looked for a taxicab. One happened to turn up. That was one thing about the City I could get used to. Whatever you wanted just happened to turn up. There was very little waiting around, and then only to build up suspense. Maybe I should just stay in my tank, and make the most of the City. It wasn't so much worse than the world. Suddenly I felt middle-aged, and I'm nearer thirty than forty. I wondered what Lissa was doing exactly now? I was supposed to be over thinking things like that. At the time, what Lissa and I did was supposed to be a trial separation. Now it felt a whole lot like being got rid of. The last I heard, she was working with one of the  fleshwear houses, designing facial alterations. Susan flagged down the cab. I opened the door for her. She hesitated \\u2014 remembering something?\\u2014 but got in. \\u2018The Temple of Turhan Bey,\\u2019 I said to the pretty girl in the front seat, a blonde under her cap. \\u2018And five bucks for every traffic law you violate getting there.\\u2019 Twenty Five THEY FADED IN again outside the Temple of Turhan Bey. Susan felt ill, but Tunney helped her stay on her feet. She couldn't help liking the man. Now he was out of his Richie Quick fugue, he seemed to have a perspective on the City. He knew how things worked, but wasn't about to be deceived again. The temple was a squat, two-storey structure, encrusted with oriental tat. A small, thin idol sat cross-legged on a dais outside, a third eye peering through a hole cut in the rim of its fez. The idol was jetstone, but the eye was alive and wet. That must be the Great God Turhan Bey itself. Susan looked around. They were in an oriental district. Coolies shuffled past them. A store across the street, still open, was selling overdecorated ornamental fans. Probably a front for a drug dealer. The taxicab had gone before Tunney could pay off the driver. \\u2018Oh no,\\u2019 Tunney murmured. \\u2018Chinatown.\\u2019 \\u2018Pardon?\\u2019 \\u2018Forget it, kid. Bad memories is all.\\u2019 His voice had gone again, his natural accent changing into Richie Quick's imitation Bogart drawl. But she could tell he was doing it for effect, he was still himself. In fact, he was getting a stronger grip on himself as he went along. Susan hoped she was too, but feared it wasn't so. Tunes pulled at the hems of her train of thought. A Chinese waif slipped by, knife in hand. She blew a kiss to Tunney, and scampered up a wall like a spider. Chinatown child, you're a Chinatown child, cursed by the temple your father defiled. Chinatown Blues, jasmine and lotus, the sad\\u2026 Susan shuddered, bounced her mind off an imaginary brick wall and caught it. She closed her eyes and concentrated for a second, shaking the blues from her thoughts. The temple was brightly lit. Candles burned in niches. The clientele going in and out of the place wore all-enveloping robes, but their posture and the expensive cars suggested they were somewhat richer than most of the people who lived in the neighbourhood. Slummers, or something more sinister. Uniformed chauffeurs stood by their proud machines in the parking lot. \\u2018Come on.\\u2019 Tunney led her around the side or the building. Ribbons of light spoked across the alley, glimmering through the interstices of an unfurled bamboo blind stretched across an entrance. The bars of light made diagonals across them. Tunney reached for the blind, slanted up the edge and bowed his way in. His hand, lingering behind a moment, made a hook for her to follow. For a second she stood alone, livid weals striping her from head to foot. Susan took Tunney's hand and was pulled inside. The foyer was empty. Patterned rugs adorned the floor and the walls. Potted jungle plants were everywhere. The heat was tropical. There were more idols, and some of the rugs had  ouija board designs or pentagrams woven into them. Somewhere a victrola was squeaking. She thought the song was \\u2018Paper Moon\\u2019, but wasn't sure. Say it's only a paper\\u2026 No! \\u2018Kruger must be upstairs. He may be dangerous. You have a gun?\\u2019 Everybody had a gun. Hers was in her handbag. \\u2018Come on. This way.\\u2019 She bit down, grinding her teeth. She wanted to tell Tunney about the songs. They were strong here. That must mean danger. But she couldn't talk and concentrate. Tunney found a spiral staircase rising through a hole in the ceiling. It was made of twisted black metal, ornamented with Eastern demons and orgies. They climbed, passing up through a zebra-crossing kaleidoscope of dark and light. On the first landing, incense hung in the air like a muslin veil. Tunney had  his Richie Quick snub-nosed automatic out. She held her own gun in her handbag. Susan was sleepy. How could she be sleepy in a dream? She would think about it-in the morning. Good night. Susan snapped back. \\u2018It's doped somehow,\\u2019 Tunney said. \\u2018Careful.\\u2019 She held her breath, and they climbed up again. And again. \\u2018Tom, we've gone up three flights. Outside, it was a two-storey building.\\u2019 \\u2018Continuity error. I've been spotting them all evening. Shhhhh, this looks promising.\\u2019 They were in a dressing-room. Robes hung from pegs along one wall. \\u2018I've seen outfits like that before,\\u2019 Tunney said. \\u2018The last time I was in Chinatown. An old fortune teller was wearing one.\\u2019 He took one habit down and slipped it on over his street clothes. The hood even covered his hat comfortably, and put his face in shadow. \\u2018You too\\u2019 He gave her the get-up, and she got into it. Behind a door, they could hear an audience shuffling, coughing and waiting for a show to start. Tunney stabbed towards the door with a thumb. \\u2018I guess we should go through and see what the picture is. Okay by you?\\u2019 \\u2018Sure.\\u2019 \\u2018Ladies first.\\u2019 \\u2018Thanks a lot.\\u2019 Twenty Six I HAD TO ADMIT the girl had guts. Or maybe the gun gave her the guts. That's the way it was with a lot of people. Back in the world, the marshal \\u2014 Juliet \\u2014 had struck me that way. The hardware gave her a shell that helped her cope. But I thought Susan was tough all the way through. She flipped the hood up over her head, fussed with it, then pushed through into the unknown. It was a theatre, full of the Krazy Klan. Steeple-hooded types were settling into their seats, or buying refreshments and programmes from usherettes dressed in spangled tights and top hats. A magician's hat, with a rabbit grinning out of it, was printed on the velvet curtains, with crossed wands beneath it. Susan and I sauntered down the aisle and took seats a few rows back. Eventually, the lights dimmed, everyone hushed, the curtains parted and the show began. Otto Kruger came out, robed, but with his hood down. He looked urbane and utterly untrustworthy. Peter Lorre was with him. He had a spherical head and fish eyes, and stayed respectfully in the background. \\u2018Blessed be,\\u2019 singsonged Kruger. \\u2018Blessed be,\\u2019 chorused the audience. We joined in, not too far off the beat to be noticed. \\u2018 Brethren , sistren, welcome to our little seance. The Great Spirit of Turhan Bey is with us tonight, I assure you. The pool of the past will clear and mysteries will be unknotted, while the curtain of the future will part to reveal what lies awaiting us all. We are as but fleas on the camel of eternity, and yet to us is given the vision, the revelation and the power. As we enter the  Age of The Goat and the Treefrog, Turhan Bey will guide our way towards the ultimate transcendence.\\u2019 There were cheers. Susan and I looked at each other, eyebrows going up under our hoods. I recognised the scam. There were lots of possibilities. In The Quick and the Dead, I had had Richie Quick come up against a similar operator. Phoney psychics could milk their rich clients for years, charging fancy prices for rap sessions with the dear departed. And there were all sorts of ways of taking money away from the wealthy and stupid. Husbands and wives would spill juicy tidbits about their personal peccadilloes to a refined occultist during private sessions and find themselves being charmingly blackmailed. And there were people in this City who would pay well for things like inventories of valuable objects, plans of security arrangements and the combinations of private safes. Someone like Kruger was in a prime position to come by such scraps of information. I wondered if the Great God Turhan Bey was in for a cut, or if Otto was doing it all off his own bat. A woman got up a few rows back, and threw the hood off her head. It was Margaret Dumont. She asked a question about her dead dog, and how happy little Foofles was in the afterlife. Nobody laughed, and Otto assured her in his best smoothie tones that said beast was scampering in the Elysian fields and piddling all over archangels' sandals. Margie was happy and sat down again, a string of pearls clacking under her robe. Then a businessman asked whether he should buy this and that stock his broker had recommended on the sly, and \\u2014 after a moment of concentration \\u2014 Kruger gave him the word to hold off, presumably making a mental note to sweep the market himself. The Great God Turhan Bey had a lot of meaningless sayings, but his favourite proverb must be \\u2018A fool and his money are soon parted\\u2019. I could have dozed off. We had to put up with a succession of dead grannies, occult trivia, psychic charades, aura readings and attempts to probe the future. As a magic show, it was a bust but money kept changing hands. Kruger didn't soil himself with the lucre, but Lorre had his fist out at every opportunity, and was wadding the bills into a fat, healthy roll while his master attempted union with the Infinite. Kruger kept making little inspirational speeches about what  Turhan Bey held for us all in the future. He picked people apparently at random, and told them which illnesses would strike. He recommended doctors. That must be another cute angle. He told ugly old women they would meet handsome young men soon, he told handsome young men they would meet large sums of money soon, he told dimwitted mothers that their sons wouldn't be coming home in nice wooden boxes from theatres of war with a 99 per cent casualty rate, he told collectors where they could locate that elusive antique backscratcher needed to complete a set. And every time he told someone something, money gravitated into Lorre's bankroll. Then the act took a new turn. One I didn't like. \\u2018Death is abroad in this city,\\u2019 he told us, a solemn mood suddenly falling upon him. \\u2018This very night, three of my closest friends have \\u2014 in supposedly unconnected incidents-met with a violent fate. I say supposedly, for as all who know Turhan Bey understand, everything is connected on the spiritual plane. My friends are still traumatised by the shock of passing over, but rest assured I shall soon be attempting communion with them. The murderers of Truro Daine, George Macready and Claude Rains shall not go free, the vicious killers will face cosmic justice, that I can promise\\u2026\\u2019 A ripple passed over his face, and he clutched his lectern. Sweat stood out on his forehead, and the cords of his neck worked against each other. Even Lorre took notice, and started forwards. \\u2018Brethren, sistren,\\u2019 Kruger gasped, waving his sidekick back. \\u2018Broken is the Golden Bowl, the spirit flown for ever, let the bell toll, a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river. I sense a presence. A presence forcing its way through from the Other Side. If you would all join hands, make a communion, perhaps we can assist our friend on his long journey to this vale of tears\\u2026\\u2019 I was already holding Susan's hand. She held that of her neighbour and I, being on the end of the row, had awkwardly to turn and grasp the hand of the man sitting behind me. There was a certain amount of rearrangement as the whole audience linked. The lights went down further, and I guessed Kruger was working up to the big climax, whatever that was. \\u2018Yes, yes, yes. I can feel the presence looming enormous now. The veils are parting, the mists are rent asunder. I see, I see, I see\\u2026\\u2019 Kruger expanded, and his voice deepened. He relaxed, and smiled confidently. I didn't like the smile. I had seen it on someone's face recently. Someone not Otto Kruger. \\u2018Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. You will pardon this interruption, I am sure, but the interests of justice must be served.\\u2019 I placed the voice at once. \\u2018It's Daine,\\u2019 I whispered to Susan. \\u2018Yes, that's right,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You would know, wouldn't you, sir? I am indeed Truro Daine. The late Truro Daine.\\u2019 The audience turned sour. I found my hand being pulled by the man behind me. My shoulder ached. Of course, I couldn't reach for my gun. Susan's fingers were locked about mine. I tried to let her hand go, but nothing happened. Glancing down, I saw our hands joined in a smooth lump of flesh. \\u2018The reason I have chosen to inconvenience this auspicious gathering is that my foul murderer is among you.\\u2019 A massed intake of breath. \\u2018Stand up if you would, child of Cain!\\u2019 I crammed myself down into my seat, but something pulled at me. On limp legs, I stood erect. Then I was pulling Susan and the man behind me upright. I felt nothing under my shoes, and my soles tingled. I was floating inches off the floor. Kruger-Daine's eyes were glowing with malevolence. The crowd was on the point of becoming a lynch mob, but were still linked in a human chain. They grumbled and stirred like a waking kraken. I was still rising, drawn upwards. Susan had hooked her legs under her seat. Our combined hand hurt. I saw pain in her face, and felt it rush up my arm. The man behind finally let go, and screamed, Susan was overcome, and floated up beside me. Kruger-Daine's eyes were fixed on us. We hovered some six feet above the rows of seats. Angry fists waved up, and someone threw something-a cigarette lighter?\\u2014 at me, striking my knee. In the air, we were manipulated like puppets. The invisible forces brought us together and made us waltz to an unheard tune. Then the music came from nowhere, the \\u2018Merry Widow Waltz\\u2019. Our robes billowed as we swung around. In Susan's eyes, I saw the music take hold. There was something about music, something that got to her. I had noticed  it before. Now she was thoroughly hypnotised. Her mouth worked silently in time with the tune. \\u2018There's blood on their hands, my friend,\\u2019 Kruger-Daine bellowed. \\u2018They are the Destroyers Turhan Bey has warned you against. Those who-would stand between you and the Achievement of the Sacred Light.\\u2019 The audience were on their feet now, shouting curses and punching the air beneath us. A couple of them had produced flaming torches from nowhere and were brandishing them with all the zeal of a party of drunken Transylvanian peasants storming Castle Frankenstein during an electrical storm. Several hoarse voices suggested unpleasant possibilities for our disposal. \\u2018They must be punished,\\u2019 the possessed psychic shrieked. \\u2018I give them to you.\\u2019 \\u2018String 'em up,\\u2019 drawled a Western voice. \\u2018Burn 'em,\\u2019 chipped in a Puritan. \\u2018Too good for 'em, torture 'em first,\\u2019 said someone with an unhealthy imagination. \\u2018Hang 'em, burn 'em, torture 'em, throw 'em to the wolves, cut off their ears and nail 'em to the notice board,\\u2019 shouted a particularly excited worshipper. \\u2018I guess this Turhan Bey isn't a God of Peace, Forgiveness and Harmony then?\\u2019 I said. Kruger-Daine grinned and shook his head. Then the force suspending us up among the chandeliers evaporated. We plunged floorwards, and the lights went out. Twenty Seven SHE WAS HANGING in a thick grey fog, just floating. There were faces in the fog, faces like masks. Ropes held her wrists and ankles, chaffing her. She could remember someone or something smashing the back of her head, and then taking the high dive into ice-cream country. Rats, this heroine business wasn't the cool breeze Vanessa Vail made it out to be. Somewhere in the formless murk, a lone blues trumpet was improvising around \\u2018Love for Sale\\u2019. It was an agonised wailing, bluesy and brilliant. The notes were perfectly played, but inside the tune were ear-punishing discords struggling to get out. The soloist was keeping them down. Just. The house lights came up again. It took a while to get the focus adjusted. And when she did, the effort wasn't worth it. She was wearing a sarong and several garlands of flowers. She was tied to a sacrificial altar. It wasn't exactly comfortable. There was a Susan-shaped contour in the stone, so nothing was sticking into her, but rock-chill seeped through the flimsy but modest garment. An ugly idol loomed above her, horns scraping the low ceiling, tusk-teeth distorting its mouth, three or more jewelled eyes reflecting firelight. Evidently, this was the temple part of the Temple of Turhan Bey. The trumpet was not a trumpet but a savage frenzy of drums, throbbing like her worst headache. \\u2018Love for Sale\\u2019 was still in there, but it would never earn Cole Porter any royalties. Robed cultists danced with moderate abandon. Otto Kruger stood by the altar, a white robe over his elegant suit. \\u2018Pay careful attention, my dear. You are privileged to be able to witness our ritual. Usually, that is denied to unbelievers.\\u2019 \\u2018Where's your dybbuk, Otto? Where's Daine?\\u2019 \\u2018A little on the dead side of things,\\u2019 purred Kruger. \\u2018Heh heh heh,\\u2019 heh-heh-hehed Peter Lorre. \\u2018There's a lot of that about.\\u2019 Kruger stroked her hair out of her face, and let his fingers linger about her chin and throat. He rattled the necklace of shells that had been wound around her neck. \\u2018You'll never get away with this,\\u2019 she snarled. She would have spat in his face, but that struck her as being unladylike. At least Kruger was a polite villain. His smile hardened at her defiance. \\u2018Actually, I rather think I will. By the way, I really must correct a false impression that I inadvertently gave just now; I said you would be permitted to observe our sacred and ancient rites. That is not strictly true. Although you will be present throughout the ceremony, I fear the later stages will find you something of a poor audience.\\u2019 \\u2018So sorry.\\u2019 If he caught the irony, he ignored it. \\u2018No need to apologise, it won't be your fault. You see, after the exalted ritual of blood sacrifice to the Great God Turhan Bey you will be far less appreciative of the aesthetic and ethnological delights of our little group. Indeed, you might say that\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018Hey, boss,\\u2019 interrupted Lorre, eyes glowing like neons. \\u2018Have you told her how we're going to kill her yet?\\u2019 \\u2018I was coming to that. I really must apologise for the ill manners of my associate. He is a true believer, but sadly lacks finesse. Besides the crudeness of his snickering, he is grossly inaccurate. We do not intend to kill you.\\u2019 \\u2018That's a relief.\\u2019 No sense skimping on the act. \\u2018Now if you could just untie me, I have a dental appointment and\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018No, indeed. Although your body will perish\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018Heh heh heh.\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2026it won't really be dying, because you'll live on in this plant.\\u2019 A man sized shrub behind Kruger and Lorre waved waxy tendrils in excitement. Clean-picked human skulls nested among its branches. Lorre put his arm around the bush, soothing it as if it were a favourite niece in whose person he took an unhealthy interest. \\u2018Heh heh heh. There now, poppet. Don't be impatient. Soon you won't be hungry any more.\\u2019 Susan concentrated, trying to Dream. A small lump of nothing rolled across the floor, gathering substance, and coalesced into an unnoticed rat. The animal began to gnaw at the ropes binding her to the altar. Attaboy, rat! Keep on chewing; Isn't hemp delicious? She latched on to the rodent's peanut-sized brain and filled it with enough extraneous material to qualify him as a genius in rat terms. She named him Albert, and gave him an insatiable appetite for ropes. This rat wanted to eat ropes the way Gene Kelly wanted to sing and dance. Gotta chew, Albert thought to himself, chew-de-chew-chew-chewdy-chew-de-chew-chew. Weirdly, out of nowhere, a thought came. I wonder how I look in a sarong? Albert was doing well. Daine must be slipping, wherever he was. He had stopped dybbukking Kruger. She could tell. They were the same type \\u2014 the off-the-peg evil mastermind \\u2014 but Kruger was too much a part of this screwy Dream to host a real mind. He had just spun the thought expressed in the sentence \\u2018I'm going to kill you\\u2019 into three paragraphs of civilised threat. He was as fake as a nine-pound piece. Where was Tunney? If this scene was anything to go by, Kruger would have him in a cellar with the waters slowly rising. Vanessa Vail must have polluted Daine's film noir universe. This was all turning into Saturday-morning chapter play. The Fighting Devil Dogs, Manhunt of Mystery Island, Zorro's Black Whip, Secret Service in Darkest Africa. The sets were cheaper, the lighting flatter, the plot even more wildly improbable. Ouch! Albert had bitten her. Ungrateful little beast! She shooed it off, vindictively giving it an urge to become a great landscape painter in place of its rope obsession. Let's see how you manage to be Constable with those tiny paws, Bertie. The ropes still held, but one good tug would part them like silk. The cultists continued their tame orgy. A pair of giant black slaves pounded drums. Interpretive dancers rushed about the chamber, waving their arms and trying to keep the fruit piled on their headdresses from coming loose. Extras wailed and rhubarbed in a lukewarm pagan frenzy. The plant was squirming in delighted anticipation. Its mouths drooled creamy sap. Kruger took up a sword-sharp scimitar and held it aloft for blessing. It shone in Susan's eyes, white fires dancing along its length. \\u2018Heh heh heh,\\u2019 heh-heh-hehed Lorre. Susan let her shaping thoughts wander around the Temple. One wall was covered by a black velvet hanging. She concentrated. The drape billowed and a tiny figure crept stealthily out, a blowpipe raised to its hideous lips. It was an Ecuadorian pygmy assassin, sworn to bring death to all the followers of the false god Turhan Bey. \\u2018In the name of Isis and Amon-Ra,\\u2019 began Kruger, \\u2018though the way we walk is thorny, and of Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep, as the rain enters the soil so the river enters the sea, and of Beelzebub and Asmodeus, so tears surround our predestined end.\\u2019 Kruger cut the air with the scimitar, and a neatly bisected feather floated in halves to the ground. With a ringing voice, he continued to declaim his unspeakable Satanic rites. The congregation raggedly joined in as he invoked every dark force in the universe. \\u2018Cave canem,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018cum grano salis in vino veritas reductio ad absurdum est.\\u2019 Puff! Kruger's sword shook slightly as the dart struck his arm. Susan twisted away from the falling edge. Kruger tried to brush the dart from his robe. It stuck thornlike into his palm. He dropped dead, undone by a nonexistent but convincing South American poison. Susan stood up, the ropes parting. She threw the remnants of her bondage away. \\u2018A miracle from the gods,\\u2019 breathed Abraham Sofaer, an indescribably ancient high priest. The cultists prostrated themselves at Susan's feet. She lost concentration, and the pygmy vanished. His blowpipe remained behind, like the Cheshire Cat's smile. \\u2018Yiu keelled heem!\\u2019 screeched Lorre, his shaking hands reaching for a revolver. Sofaer nodded, and Lorre was seized by many pairs of dusky hands. The gangster struggled, but was overpowered. Susan turned away from the churning and screaming and slurping and crying. \\u2018Heh heh heh,\\u2019 heh-heh-hehed the plant. Twenty Eight I WOKE UP in a terrarium, half in and half out of a stagnant pool. My first priority, I knew, was to make friends with the two craggy, grey alligators who shared my basement prison. In this neighbourhood, every building came complete with an alligator pit. They were de rigueur, like swimming pools in Suburbia. The luggage lizards were asleep when I came to. They had sawtooth snores, and were dreaming about eating someone. Someone exactly like me. Lazily they began to stir, showing an unpleasant interest in me. I Dreamed up two sides of beef, fresh butchered and dripping pink and red. The colour bled across the grey stone and vegetation of the pit. At first the beeves were indistinct masses, cold and blurry, but I eventually got a satisfactory materialisation. It was my idea of what an alligator might find appealing. The male got up first, and wrapped his lantern jaws around a hunk of meat. That aroused his better half. \\u2018There now,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Nice 'gators.\\u2019 I imagined they were old and slow reptiles, too far gone to chase a sprightly private detective around their pit, content just to chew placidly on a hunk of dead cow. And they were. It occurred to me that the minions Kruger had entrusted with the task of feeding me to Heckle and Jeckle had been careless. They had forgotten to lock up, ever eager to hurry back to the endless rounds of torturing and giggling that are the happy lot of a sadistic underling. I was right. I decided that what with the big human-sacrifice convention  in town, the cultists would be too busy to post any of the grade-A guards, and that the job would fall to Sleepy Joe and the Catnap Kid. That's exactly how it turned out. I slipped past the dozing duo, and found myself in a labyrinth of corridors. The next thing was to find Susan. She had made a difference. We were Dreaming now, reshaping Daine's hideaway. The more it changed, the more it could change. Susan was real. A solid-silver doll. But\\u2026 Governor Trefusis had told me there would be two real people around this Dream. Me and Daine. The Princetown psychs hadn't said anything about sending in a back-up. I had a nasty thought. What if Susan were Daine in disguise? Back in the world, I had barely had a nodding acquaintance with the girl. I couldn't be expected to tell now whether she was live or Memorex. Becoming a woman wouldn't be beyond Truro Daine. When he was living in his body, he had it made over so many times that there was hardly any of what he had been born with left. He/She could be looking for a Double Indemnity climax. Just when the hero really needs the girl's help, she stands revealed as a killer with a long history of leading enslaved men to destruction, a siren wrapped in furs and degeneracy, venom in her veins, murder in her mind\\u2026 That's not the way I wanted it to be, but I had had a lot of disappointments lately. There were plenty of interesting items in the temple basements. A torture chamber where skeletons hung in tatters on disused racks and in iron maidens, a musty crypt where giant armadillos and wasps crawled between the catafalques, an opium den with rows of blank-eyed imbibers mindwiping themselves, and a laboratory full of bubbling retorts and crackling electrical equipment. I met Susan on the stairs. She was in a Dorothy Lamour island-princess number that showed her shape. I kissed her. It seemed like the thing to do. She didn't mind. I kissed her again, putting more into it this time. I hoped to God she wasn't Truro Daine. She pulled away, surprised eyes sparkling, and let her hands play with the back of my neck: I tasted sweet lipstick. Okay, so it's mushy, but you always have to have some love interest. \\u2018Kruger and Lorre are out of the picture,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I'm the reborn high priestess of Turhan Bey.\\u2019 \\u2018Great.\\u2019 \\u2018\\u2026 And the bad news is that some treacherous skitch called the police.\\u2019 \\u2018Damn! We've got to leave!\\u2019 \\u2018Sure. Steal me a mink, would you?\\u2019 \\u2018I can do better than that.\\u2019 I Dreamed her up a street outfit. I hated to exchange the basic wraparound for a tailored suit, but I had priorities. And staying alive was on top of the list. \\u2018How did you know my size\\u2013\\u2019 \\u2018Good judgement. Let's get out of here.\\u2019 It was exciting again, and life was a game of hide and go seek. There were familiar sirens outside. The cops never go anywhere in the City without alerting all the wrongdoers in the neighbourhood. By the time we made it to the foyer, a panic had started. Well-dressed suckers were pouring out of the upstairs theatre, barrelling down the rickety spiral staircase, skidding on the highly polished floor. There were others mixed in with the crowd, dressed in indeterminate native outfits, somewhere between Polynesian, gypsy, Masai, Ancient Egyptian and Comanche. I was separated from Susan by a flood of flailing humanity. \\u2018Outta my way!\\u2019 said a big man, knocking me over. \\u2018Pardon me!\\u2019 said a big woman, stepping on me. A tommy gun rat-tat-tatted into the ceiling. Chinese paper ornaments and showers of dust fell. Everyone freeze-framed. I took the welcome opportunity to stand up. Two impassive cops in shiny black raincoats levelled guns like the Gestapo rehearsing for a massacre. Barton MacLane and Ralph Bellamy came through the door. MacLane was smiling, and that was a collector's item. I could already feel the rubber hosepipe. I was sure this was where I came in. Someone must have done some extensive informing, because MacLane picked Susan and me out of the crowd without even the pretence of looking around for the usual suspects. \\u2018Hello, gumshoe. You been a busy boy tonight. Don't think  we didn't see you around when Claude Rains made with the Lindbergh act, by the way. And that goes for your girlfriend and the punctured cab driver too. You both got a nice long rest coming.\\u2019 I put my hands in my coat pockets. \\u2018You know what,\\u2019 snarled MacLane, \\u2018I wish you would. I'd love to save the taxpayers some money and shoot it out with you.\\u2019 I eased out of the pockets and showed him my open, empty hands. The smile went away. \\u2018Okay, outside!\\u2019 he barked at us. \\u2018The rest of you people, get lost! And don't do it again.\\u2019 We were impersonally helped out of the temple. Bellamy was aw-gosh polite to Susan, but I got some unnecessary shoving. A cop grabbed my wrist and handy-helped me into the street. That wasn't too pleasant, since he had apparently come direct from a City-wide garlic and limburger cheese sandwich-consumption championship. \\u2018What do you know, it had stopped raining outside. The City was still wearing the wet look. Drains were overflowing, and globs of water clung to everything, but it had stopped raining. The air tasted cleaner. Next thing you knew, it would be daybreak. I could picture that: a Technicolor sunrise, and three singing sailors swarming through the docks. Either we were altering the Dream for ever, or Daine was signalling to us that it was time to get out of his head. MacLane had us stand against a wall, facing the bricks. Bellamy reported to police headquarters over his two-way wrist radio, wrapping up the case. I looked at Susan, and she looked at me. We both smiled, and I knew for a fact that she wasn't Daine. \\u2018Hey, what are you doing?\\u2019 shouted Bellamy. \\u2018Stop him, someone!\\u2019 Shots hit the wall above me. I had chips of brick on the brim of my fedora. Susan cried out as her face was stung. I turned around. Bellamy was struggling with MacLane. Between them was a tommy gun, discharging itself into the air. An innocent bystander kneeled over. Poor sap. Many of the cultists kissed sidewalk. I hugged Susan to me. \\u2018You can't do it!\\u2019 Bellamy was saying. \\u2018You can't kill people just because you're a cop!\\u2019 Personally, I wished Bellamy would quit trying to be reasonable and concentrate on the wrestling. I had a strong feeling that Barton MacLane was no cop. Barton MacLane was Truro Daine. I pulled Susan, and made a break for it. One of the squad cars was standing empty. The uniformed cops and a couple of detectives were watching their superiors slug it out. I hoped they'd be distracted enough to ignore our getaway attempt. MacLane had the edge as far as weight, toughness and meanness went. But that put him at a disadvantage according to the flatty rules Daine had strung himself with. MacLane fought dirty. Bellamy did the Marquis of Queensberry proud, and landed a series of good, honest punches above the belt. He had even white teeth, he was hero material. Even with a badge, MacLane was a blundering thug. Bellamy landed a solid right on MacLane's jaw. The captain staggered backwards, tripped over the dropped gun and fell onto the sidewalk. The gun skittered across wet asphalt. I folded myself into a police car, dragging Susan after me. I felt under the dash for the dangling keys I had Dreamed there. The engine caught first time. The offside rear door opened, and Ralph Bellamy squeezed in. There were shots, and the back window powdered. I gunned the car. We squeal-turned around the crowd, and zigzagged away from the Temple of Turhan Bey. If I ran anybody over, I didn't pay any attention. Bellamy exchanged wild shots with MacLane as we left the captain in the middle of the road. I glanced back and saw MacLane clambering onto the running board of an already growling squad car, holding the tommy gun one-armed. He fired an experimental burst into the air, and waved his armoured troops forwards like George S. Patton himself. It was car-chase time. I drove through a street market, up and down hills, in and out of alleyways, through tarpaper shacks. The car leaped swimming pools and ruptured bridges. There was a whole platoon of black-and-whites on our tail at the outset, but we lost them one by one. They plunged into lakes, crashed into busses, flipped over like turtles or got jammed between lampposts. I drove like a champion, and Susan kept Dreaming obstacles into our pursuers' way. An earthquake crack appeared jaggedly like  lightning across the road behind us, and two more cop cars plunged into a bottomless pit. MacLane's car leaped the crack and kept after us. He was the most difficult to dodge, of course. He kept firing his inexhaustible gun at us, shattering the entire rear of the car\\u2013 Susan threw up enough concealed armour plate to keep us safe, but ricochets still twanged through the night. A flaming arrow came from somewhere and lodged in our roof. Susan punched through the metal and pinched the fire out with a suddenly spade-sized hand. A white-haired little old lady pushing a pramful of quintuplets started crossing the road up ahead of us. They were taking their time, as she coochy-cooed down at the gurgling little cutenesses. I crashed through them. What the hell, they weren't real, right? Granny exploded like a sack of offal. Babies flew everywhere and burst like watermelons on the road. Daine couldn't make me feel guilty. Susan got it, but Bellamy was appalled and had to be mollified. \\u2018Undercover killer midgets,\\u2019 I said, \\u2018the City is full of 'em.\\u2019 MacLane's\\u2013 driver swerved out of his way to get the last crawling quintuplet. It popped under a wheel. Obviously, I had started the next craze. \\u2018Susan,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Do something.\\u2019 \\u2018Okay. Take this turn here.\\u2019 I leaned over on the wheel. We swung into a drive, knocking a mesh gate askew and waking up a snoring security guard. An alarm sounded, and searchlights raked a factory complex. \\u2018What's this place?\\u2019 \\u2018The Acme Explosives and Infernal Devices Company,\\u2019 said Susan. \\u2018Just drive around the plant.\\u2019 \\u2018This never used to be here,\\u2019 said Bellamy. \\u2018This was a vacant lot when I drove past it on my way to headquarters earlier this evening.\\u2019 \\u2018I'll explain later,\\u2019 said Susan. We did a figure eight around two bulbous tanks marked HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE \\u2014 DO NOT SMOKE OR DISCHARGE FIREARMS. MacLane was still hard on our rear bumper. He shouted insults at us. I kept on our course, letting the leathered wheel slide through my hands. A stray chip turned the windshield white, and Susan pushed it out in a lump. Rainwater swept into the car and got into my eyes. \\u2018Now!\\u2019 shouted Susan. I pulled out of the eight, stamped the accelerator down through the floor and drove for a gate. We smashed through it and came to a halt, a tangle of wire wrapped around the hood. I turned round in my seat to get a good view. Bellamy was shaking his head in a daze. MacLane's driver wasn't up to it. Their car skidded in gravel, flipped up and over like a pancake and lodged itself in a sundered tank. Viscous liquid oozed out like an alien blob and slowly enveloped the dented car. MacLane was still on the running board, his arm wedged into the squashed wreck of the car. Slime crept down his sleeve. With a cry of rage, he puffed on his much-chewed stogie and fired at us. Ka-BOOM! It was an explosion of atomic proportions. A mushroom of intense white light rose, taking MacLane with it. The yard was bright as day for a few seconds, then night crept back in around the flames. Trails of burning liquid spiderwebbed out across the site, licking at the other tanks. People ran for cover. I Dreamed the mess under our wheels into tissue paper and drove off before the rest of the place could go up. I \\u2018Look,\\u2019 said Susan, pointing. We were driving past the Inferno Factory. There was a figure walking in the flames. \\u2018That's not possible.\\u2019 \\u2018Anything's possible for the Night Mayor.\\u2019 MacLane-Daine came out of the jungle of fire, a human torch, arms raised like Frankenstein's monster. He kept coming after us. I pushed the pedal again, and we easily outdistanced the walking fireball. In the darkness behind us, MacLane coming. He threw a handful of fire at us, but it missed, landing in a sizzle in the branches of a wet tree. He screamed with an inhuman ferocity. Bellamy was breathing heavily after the exertion. He wasn't really equipped mentally to handle this. His screen character was one of dunderheaded amiability, and Daine hadn't given him enough self-awareness to adapt with the Dream. \\u2018Why would Captain MacLane want to kill you, Richie?\\u2019 he asked, straightforward eyes wide open. \\u2018It's a long story.\\u2019 \\u2018I knew he was on the take, but I never had enough evidence to show Hamilton. There were just lots of things wrong. Funny  little things like the way he could find a mental case to confess to every gangland killing, and the number of prisoners who had sudden heart attacks while he was questioning them. Stuff like that.\\u2019 \\u2018No doubt about it, the guy was a fink and a hoodlum,\\u2019 I said, \\u2018and worse.\\u2019 \\u2018He used to be a good cop.\\u2019 Thinking it through was causing plodding, methodical Ralph Bellamy some considerable pain. \\u2018I guess the temptation was too much, huh? Crime, I hate it!\\u2019 \\u2018Where do we go from here?\\u2019 asked Susan, shivering. \\u2018I have a place in the hills. Out of town,\\u2019 said Bellamy. \\u2018We can shack up there until I get word to Hamilton. MacLane doesn't know about it. We'll be safe.\\u2019 \\u2018Fine. Direct me.\\u2019 We faded towards the outskirts of the city. The police car held the wet roads, even the treacherous lanes that snaked up into the hills. It seemed odd not to be surrounded by concrete, but the jungle-dense trees and vertiginous inclines were hardly less oppressive. Up in the sky, there was the faintest glimmering of a moon. Bellamy had a pioneer cabin overlooking the City. A white hurricane lamp burned in the window. It was homey. There were no other residences around. When we got out of the car, we found the only sound came from the chirping crickets. \\u2018My wife will fix you coffee.\\u2019 \\u2018I could do with some shoes,\\u2019 said Susan. \\u2018Kruger took mine.\\u2019 Bellamy laughed good-naturedly, and paused to light his pipe. I looked down at Susan's dirty white feet on the dirt road. I had forgotten to Dream her footwear. \\u2018We'll try to dig you up something.\\u2019 The cabin door opened, and a woman stepped out. For a moment the porch shadowed her, then the moon came out form behind the dissipating clouds. Light fell on her face. She was ravishing. Susan Hayward? Eleanor Parker? No, Rhonda Fleming. Captain Barton MacLane just didn't like private eyes. In murder mysteries, it is always the least suspicious person who turns out to be the killer. Someone friendly, handsome, reliable, considerate, decent and helpful. Someone like Ralph Bellamy. \\u2018Daine!\\u2019 Like all the best exposed culprits, he didn't try to bluff it out. He took his pipe out of Bellamy's mouth. The face was dark for a second, then he puffed again, and the glow showed his own features. He rippled and reconstituted. Bellamy's clothes hung strangely tight on him. He changed to tweeds and an alpine hat. \\u2018It's been a good game, Mr Tunney, but it's over now. I'm going to have to kill you both.\\u2019 He had a hunting rifle. \\u2018And, consequent to your failure, I doubt if I'll have any more intruders in my cloud.\\u2019 \\u2018You won't get away with it,\\u2019 I said, demonstrating my occasional weakness with dialogue. \\u2018When you wake up, give my kindest regards to governor Trefusis, and tell the world I shall be making my presence felt very soon.\\u2019 \\u2018They'll pull the plug, no matter what the law says.\\u2019 \\u2018Possibly, Ms Bishopric, possibly. However, I have colonised the life-support fail-safe system. That's what the game's been about, you know, distracting the governor until I was beyond him. Those biomek filaments have been growing into the tank, you know. I shall now wage my own little war in the circuits and spaces of Yggdrasil, and there's no way you can reach me. Happy wipe-out. I'll look you up when the whole world is my Dream.\\u2019 Daine was observing the tradition that the bad guy should always explain his crimes in great detail before trying to kill the hero. Rhonda Fleming leaned on him, pouting, stroking the goatee he was affecting. \\u2018You must know Cornell Woolrich, Mr Tunney. Do you remember\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2018First you Dream\\u2026\\u2019 \\u2019\\u2026then you die. Quite.\\u2019 The gun came up. Twenty-Nine  SHE HAD BEEN keeping quiet. Tunney and Daine squared up to each other like the black-hat and white-hat cowboys. Only the white hat didn't have a chance to pull his six-shooter. There was a symmetry she found appealing to the scene. Two men, with women at their sides. But Daine's bove bimbo was a fantasy, and Susan was real. Daine didn't count women as real anyway. That's what left him open to what she was going to do to him. She reached for him, slid easily into his head, and made an explosion. She fed him Cleo Laine, backed by The Ramones. Blow, blow thou Winter wynd, thou wert not so unkind as man's ingratitude! Thy tooth is not so keen, because thou art not seen, although thy breath be rude! She took all the bones out of his spinal column and compressed them to nothing, she turned his eyeballs inward, she jellied his legs, she unplugged and rewired his guts. His fingers became fat maggots and detached themselves from his doughnut hands. They burrowed into the wet earth. Standing over the squalling creature she had fashioned, she conjured a three-foot-long sharpened stake from the air. She plunged it through the Daine Thing, ignoring the clear fluid that squished out of the puncture, and drove it deep. It sank through the monstrosity and into the earth. With a stone, she pounded the stake until Daine was pinned in his place, a burst jellyfish god. The sky ripped and hung in tatters, revealing plasterboard and lath behind. Arc lights fell into cardboard forests. She left Daine to writhe, and wrenched his Dream apart. The City bled and burned. Lights went out, and tinsel was whipped out to sea. The earth split open, and buildings tumbled into the fissures. Susan put her mind to it, and tore up the City. Chunks of stone flew into the air and became ice. Roads bubbled and slid like tar glaciers. People became mannequins and were consumed by the chaos. Then the burning man came from out of nowhere and took her down. Thirty WE WERE IN the dark again. The mess on the ground in front of me came together as a man, and Daine \\u2014 still dazed from his transformations, still pinned like a vampire butterfly \\u2014 stared up in hatred. He was shrieking. I kicked his gun away, and dived at MacLane. The cop was still burning. I shut out the pain and pushed him away from Susan. We struggled. The fire man and I rolled in the wet undergrowth. Nothing seemed to extinguish the flames. My face scorched, and I couldn't see properly. Susan reeled away from us, flames springing up where she had been touched. The cop and I rolled over and over, crushing each other, towards the precipice. The City was below us, dark shapes and scattering of lights. Beyond the City, over the bay, there was a trace of dawn. I slugged MacLane in the face. He tried to strangle me. That marked him as an amateur. You should never try to throttle someone who has his hands free. Nobody's little fingers are stronger than a man's hands. I prised his pinkies out of my throat, and bent them back. They snapped like burned-through twigs and I threw them away. The jolt got through to him, and he sprang off me. We were near the edge. I kicked out, and his leg broke in two places. The flames were dying down. I could see his blackened, swollen face. He stood for a moment, and without a sound fell off the hillside. I peered over the edge. His flames whipped in the wind like a tattered kite. The fireball became tiny and winked out. There was quiet. Daine was still struggling against the stake. Susan was on the ground, patting at the patches of fire on her suit. Rhonda was superfluous to this scene, and had disappeared back to her dressing room. With a yell, Daine got both hands on the stake and wrenched. It came free and he threw it at me. I dodged it as Daine stood up. He swelled, altering his insides. He was going to make himself invulnerable, and then turn Susan and me into ragged carpets. I had my gun out. I got Daine in the chest, over the heart. He stiffened, then the blood and burn on his jacket faded away. I shot him again, and again. I emptied the clip. It was like throwing stones into a lake. There were ripples, but they went away. I Dreamed more bullets into the gun, and shot him full of more lead. He staggered, but kept on moving. I Dreamed my gun bigger, and sprayed him with tracers. There were little explosions in the air around him. His jacket flew open, and gouts of flesh fell away from his ribs. The wound patched over with timber-textured vinyl. I threw my gun away, and pulled a bazooka out of the air. I took him down with a shell, and he flew to pieces. The pieces kept crawling together. I walked to the crater I had made, and stamped on the wriggling bits of Daine. I couldn't stop him reforming, but when he came together all the polish was gone off. His face was just pasted over a badly formed skull. He turned his hand into a buzzsaw, and buried it in my leg, but I phantomed myself before he could breach my similie. I drifted back, insubstantial, but concentrated on keeping a form. I solidified. Susan was beside me now, kneeling on Daine's chest, his lapels in her fists, locking his mind with hers, forcing herself into his head. He was sobbing and swearing as she raped his skull. I held her shoulders and reached through her to Daine. We held him, and squeezed hard. \\u2018He's going home\\u2019 she said. His twitching body became transparent. Her hands grew into him, and tore like crabs at what was left of his dreamself. He hadn't thought out his internal organs properly, and they leaked into each other. Susan pulled out handfuls of ectoplasm and threw them aside. She let him go, and we stood up. I shot him in the forehead. A black penny-sized spot appeared and he went stiff. Then he  faded. There were clothes on the ground, and wisps of something immaterial. The night went out. Susan and I sat on the paling hillside as the sky whitened. There was a slight breeze that riffled her hair. As the dreamsun showed us the insubstantial outlines of the City down in the valley, we faded to white. Thirty-One WHEN SUSAN woke up, Dr Groome was picking terminals off her face. Beyond the doctor, she could see Trefusis and Juliet, peering at her. She sat up, and sloshed out of the tank. The liquid dried on her skin. Dr Groome held up three fingers and asked, \\u2018How many?\\u2019 Susan tried to tell her, but her vocal chords wouldn't work. She held up three fingers in answer. The doctor allowed herself a smile. There was another man in the room. A man she didn't at first recognise. Without his fedora his hairline was receding, and the clothe was wrong on him the way a trench coat had been right. Tom Tunney waved at her, but didn't say anything. He was shorter out of the City, but gave the impression of being more solid. \\u2018Daine?\\u2019 she croaked, her throat papery and hurting. Governor Trefusis shrugged. \\u2018I'm afraid you've had a wasted trip, Ms Bishopric. When you drove him from his Dream, it proved too much. You mindwiped him entirely.\\u2019 \\u2018I'm heartbroken.\\u2019 Trefusis smiled tightly. \\u2018Me too.\\u2019 Juliet and Tunney helped her out of the tank. Daine's screen was giving a level brain-dead readout. \\u2018More much-needed organs for the transplant crews,\\u2019 said Dr Groome, systematically disconnecting Daine's inputs. She stared down at the living dead face. \\u2018It wasn't a waste,\\u2019 Susan gasped. \\u2018Ask Yggdrasil sometime.\\u2019 Dr Groome brushed away a cloud of fine wires connecting  the patient to his tank. \\u2018Hmm,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018I wonder where these came from?\\u2019 Susan's knees didn't work properly yet. She sagged against Tunney. \\u2018You'll get used to it after a while,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Welcome to the waking world.\\u2019 He kissed her. But that wasn't why she fainted.\",\n          \"The head then commented on his social development.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s really a surprise for me to know that you can become like this after being in the world.\\u201d\\nThe head looked at him with admiration and said, \\u201cYou are so well-versed in this world, and you have lived here for more than 20 years, but I never thought you would be able to make such great progress. It\\u2019s amazing!\\u201d\\nAfter saying that, he was still not satisfied with it. He couldn\\u2019t help but say, \\u201cNow, you can also enter our sect and become a disciple of our sect! After all, your skills are very good. You should definitely become a member of the Xu family and inherit our inheritance!\\u201d\\nXiao Chen nodded his head and agreed with a smile.\\nHowever, there were still some things he had to say.\\n\\u201cThank you, Elder Xu, for giving me this opportunity, but\\u2026\\u201d\\nXiao Chen turned his head and saw Ye Qiuping standing behind him with a pale face.\\nShe didn\\u2019t say anything when she saw her son standing here. She didn\\u2019t dare to speak out because she was afraid of affecting her son\\u2019s future.\\nEven though Xiao Chen had told her about what happened earlier, she was still worried. She didn\\u2019t want to see her child suffer any more.\\nThinking back to how powerful the Lord Headmaster was, she felt her heart tremble. Even if she wanted to say something, she didn\\u2019t dare to.\\nHearing Xiao Chen\\u2019s words, the head of the Xu Family knew what he meant. He smiled and waved his hand gently.\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s okay. Don\\u2019t worry too much. Now, you can come and study together with your fellow disciples. I will let them take care of you. There is no need to stay here anymore.\\u201d\\nThe head of the Xu Family sighed and said, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, my son. I hope you don\\u2019t blame me for this matter.\\u201d\\nXiao Chen nodded slightly and said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, Elder Xu. This matter has nothing to do with you.\\u201d\\nThe head of the Xu family frowned slightly and asked, \\u201cDo you mean that you have been hurt?\\u201d\\nXiao Chen shook his head and said, \\u201cI\\u2019m fine. But I think I won\\u2019t be able to eat for a while. Can I go home and rest first? Then, I\\u2019ll come back tomorrow morning to start training.\\u201d\\nThe head of the Xu family nodded, and then waved his sleeves.\\nA dozen people came over from outside and surrounded Xiao Chen.\\nThen, they began to carry Xiao Chen away.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2 Epochs\",\n          \"8 Epochs\",\n          \"BNC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ACA\",\n          \"FIC\",\n          \"NEWS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 101,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Llanidloes finished on 127\\u20139, in which Sean Southern bagged 2\\u201334 in 25 overs, while Cae Glas had earlier compiled 191\\u20135 thanks to Jeff Potts (65) Mike Evans (37) and Ben Hipkiss (31).\",\n          \"If you read that the way you picked up a wine glass was magical, then you can never do that again unself-consciously\\u2019 \\u2014Actress Anna Massey.\",\n          \"Indeed,\\u2019 Corbett stirred, staring behind the nun into the mist, \\u2018they may have slept more deeply than they ever intended.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Briefly, with no blocking, each record will occupy an entire track and, for a fixed number of tracks, the largest record that can be stored is one with a size equal to half the sum of all the block sizes. With one-block blocking, this upper bound increases to twice the sum of all the block sizes; with two-block blocking, it increases again to three times the sum of all the block sizes; with three-block blocking, it increases to four times the sum of all the block sizes, etc. Hence, a linear increase in the amount of storage space available for records occurs with each increase in the number of blocks.\\nBlocking also affects the overall record density, since blocks are typically placed at 50% full or above. O'Neill shows that this means the density decreases approximately logarithmically with increasing blocking factor: the capacity per square inch drops from .436 for no blocking to .392 for one-block blocking, .385 for two-block blocking, .381 for three-block blocking, etc. As mentioned previously, these densities have been achieved on disk packs. However, if the average file size is much smaller than the track size, then the total number of tracks required will increase considerably. For example, on a system where the average file size is 5 KB, it would take 125 tracks to store 1 GB of data without any blocking, but only 40 tracks with one-block blocking.\\nFurthermore, even if the same number of tracks is used, the time needed to seek to a particular track may be increased significantly. If the seek time takes approximately 1 ms, the time taken to perform a seek to a single track is thus\\nwhere N is the number of tracks. If the number of tracks increases tenfold, the seek time increases by a factor of roughly 10.\\nIn addition, although the density can be improved by using higher-density media, the cost per unit area rises dramatically with increasing blocking factor, so that for high-density storage systems, the cost advantage of blocking disappears.\\nFor these reasons, it seems likely that for the foreseeable future, disk packs will use no blocking at all.\\n3.3 File Layout\\nFile layout refers to how the files are physically stored on the disk. The choice of layout has a significant impact on the system performance. There are several alternatives.\\n3.3.1 Sequential Layout\\nWith sequential layout, each file is stored in order, starting at the first track of the first cylinder. The disadvantages of sequential layout include the following:\\nA large percentage of the disk surface is wasted.\\nThe search time for a particular file can be quite long, because the entire disk must be searched to find the desired file.\\nWhen many small files are present on the disk, a large fraction of the disk is unused. This leads to poor utilization.\\nSeek time increases with the number of files on the disk.\\nHence, sequential layout is rarely used. It is sometimes used in special situations such as when there are few files and they are relatively large, and it may be used for scratch disks in order to avoid wasting space on the main disk.\\n3.3.2 Direct Layout\\nDirect layout is a compromise between sequential and random layout. In direct layout, the files are sorted according to their final position on the disk. That is, if the file is known in advance to be on cylinder C, sector S, then it is placed immediately after the preceding file on cylinder C, sector S.\\nThe advantage of direct layout is that most of the files are placed near the beginning of the disk, which reduces the seek time. Furthermore, the seek time varies directly with the number of files stored, whereas the seek time for sequential layout increases exponentially.\\nHowever, direct layout does waste a certain portion of the disk surface. The degree to which this waste is acceptable depends on the ratio of the size of the largest file to the average file size. If the largest file is very large relative to the average file size, then the wastage becomes severe.\\nAnother problem with direct layout is that if many files are added to the disk, the locations of the existing files need to be rearranged. Thus, direct layout can require substantial additional work during system initialization and when new files are created.\\n\",\n          \"Scanner appeal co-ordinator Jack Froggatt said: \\u2018The town centre bombings raised awareness of the need for a scanner in Warrington and money has been coming in much quicker since then.\\u2019 It is now hoped to reach the \\u00a31m target by the autumn.\\nThe hospital hopes to have an MRI scanner operating on its site by 2008, but says it will take five years to build.\\nThe trust\\u2019s head of radiology, Dr David Chadwick, said: \\u2018We are trying to raise funds to buy a mobile scanner which can be used around the borough.\\n\\u2018This would be much more cost effective than building a new unit at the hospital.\\u2019\",\n          \"Everywhere I hear about the malaise and uncertainty this is producing. The only thing that seems to be certain at present, in any sector of the economy or society as a whole, is change. And change, when it comes, can often lead to further disruption.\\nThe single most important question facing the future of the industry is \\u201cwhat will happen with the workforce?\\u201d How will the COVID-19 pandemic affect our ability to recruit? What will be the long term impact on retention and morale? There are no easy answers to these questions, but we have some preliminary data from research conducted by ISSA on behalf of IFMA. In the following pages, you\\u2019ll find insights into how facility professionals are thinking about these issues, as well as what they are doing to prepare for their potential impact.\\nIt was clear early on that the coronavirus outbreak would profoundly affect every aspect of daily life across the globe. As the crisis has continued to unfold, we\\u2019ve seen it affect businesses, schools, governments, health care systems, and virtually all other aspects of modern society.\\nAs the crisis continues to evolve, we expect to see more changes. One area that is likely to experience major disruptions is the global labor market. It\\u2019s not hard to imagine the potentially devastating consequences of millions of people losing their jobs. While many companies have already taken steps to keep staff employed, including furloughing workers and reducing hours, there may be an additional need to consider the possibility of permanent job losses.\\nIn its recent report, Hiring and Retaining Talent During Uncertain Times, ISSA suggests that there could be significant shortages of qualified talent available to fill positions that become open. The survey found that 83% of respondents believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a negative impact on hiring and retaining talent. More than half (52%) said that they anticipate having difficulty finding qualified candidates in their next round of hiring, while 40% expect it to take longer to attract top talent. Nearly one third (31%) said that they expect there will be a shortage of suitable applicants for open positions.\\nDespite these concerns, however, facilities management professionals seem relatively optimistic about their ability to maintain a steady flow of new hires over time. This may reflect their confidence in the importance of the role they play within organizations as well as their belief in their own value proposition \\u2013 which includes strong compensation packages and career advancement opportunities for those who perform well.\\nHowever, even if your company remains committed to keeping employees engaged during times of economic uncertainty, there are still challenges ahead. For example, some workers may decide to look elsewhere for better prospects after experiencing layoffs or reduced hours due to coronavirus-related budget cuts. Others might choose not to return once restrictions lift because they prefer working remotely full-time or part-time instead of commuting back into office buildings several days each week.\\nThere is also evidence suggesting that some employers may continue reducing headcount despite signs pointing toward recovery because they want more flexibility in terms of where and when workers do their jobs. These trends could create additional pressure on employers looking to fill vacancies quickly without sacrificing quality hires who meet specific skill sets needed for success in today's competitive environment.\\nWhile these developments raise serious concerns about the future availability of skilled personnel worldwide, there are reasons for cautious optimism: Many countries around the globe are starting to reopen economies after months of lockdowns imposed in response to outbreaks of COVID-19. That means more people returning to work \\u2014 either physically or virtually \\u2014 which should increase demand for new hires across industries such as FM/Facilities Management.\\nIn addition, many companies have implemented temporary measures designed specifically to help keep existing employees safe until the situation improves significantly enough that they feel comfortable bringing everyone back together again under normal conditions. These include everything from offering flexible schedules so that fewer individuals share common areas at any given time; encouraging social distancing practices throughout offices, warehouses and manufacturing facilities; providing PPE equipment like masks and gloves; setting up dedicated space for those who need respiratory protection devices like N95 face masks and surgical gowns; installing plexiglass barriers between desks; installing hand sanitizers throughout buildings; and educating all staff members about proper hygiene habits.\\nAll these measures help ensure that employers remain compliant with federal regulations regarding workplace safety standards set forth by OSHA (Occupational Safety & Health Administration\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2 Epochs\",\n          \"4 Epochs\",\n          \"8 Epochs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ACA\",\n          \"FIC\",\n          \"NEWS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 101,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Llanidloes finished on 127\\u20139, in which Sean Southern bagged 2\\u201334 in 25 overs, while Cae Glas had earlier compiled 191\\u20135 thanks to Jeff Potts (65) Mike Evans (37) and Ben Hipkiss (31).\",\n          \"If you read that the way you picked up a wine glass was magical, then you can never do that again unself-consciously\\u2019 \\u2014Actress Anna Massey.\",\n          \"Indeed,\\u2019 Corbett stirred, staring behind the nun into the mist, \\u2018they may have slept more deeply than they ever intended.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The\\nVice-Chancellor is not in any way the head of the university as\\nsuch; he is its Chief Executive Officer, and the whole question of his powers and functions must be subordinate to that fact.\\nYet this view has been challenged by recent events. In the first place there has been a\\nstriking change in emphasis at Oxford University. Professor Woodward's\\ndeparture coincided with the elevation of Dr Alan Rusbridger, Principal of St Anne's College, Oxford, to the post of Pro-Vice Chancellor (Student Education).\\nThe new position had been created as part of an attempt to reorganise the universities in order to meet their growing financial problems. To improve efficiency, administrative departments are being merged or abolished. At Oxford, the old Department for Student Education was dissolved and replaced by the Directorate for Student Services. Its chairman is Professor Peter Scott, formerly Dean of Students at the University of Cambridge.\\nProfessor Scott's duties include 'the conduct of student affairs', which\\nmeans, according to his official biography, 'representing students' interests on all major issues affecting them'. Thus it would appear that what the Vice-Chancellor cannot do himself is done by someone else. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the powers of the Vice-Chancellor have been diminished. There is no doubt that the Vice-Chancellors of the other ancient universities have similar powers.\\nBut a more serious challenge comes from the anti-authoritarian tendencies of the student body itself. This year, there were a number of incidents which illustrate how far the\\nconventional notion of the university executive has been eroded.\\nIn June 1975, the National Union of Students issued a statement attacking\\nthe use of force against demonstrators at the University of Sussex. They\\ncomplained that 'the use of force has become standard procedure in dealing with demonstrations and in particular with pickets.' They went on: 'We feel that the vice chancellor's right to decide when force can be used, should not be exercised without proper consultation between the unions and management.' This may seem like the usual NUS rhetoric. But it goes beyond the usual practice.\\nIt is true that the Vice-Chancellors have always been in a position to influence decisions about the use of force. But until recently they were never invited to take part in such discussions. As long ago as 1963, the then Vice-Chancellor of Nottingham University, Sir Charles Webster, wrote: 'I have always thought it preferable to keep out of these controversies, and indeed I am not sure that it is entirely appropriate for the Vice-Chancellor of a university to be concerned with questions of this kind.'\\nThis is still the conventional attitude. Last December, Professor J. W.\\nBarnard, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bristol, told the academic staff that he did not want 'to be drawn into an argument about policing demonstrations'. He said: 'There are certain things one ought not to get involved in. I don't want to be accused of using force for the purpose of breaking up a lawful demonstration.'\\nThe implication here is that it is improper for a senior administrator to interfere in matters of police action. This view is widely shared among academics. When Professor Stephen Sedley, who is now one of the three Judges of the High Court of Justice in London, became Vice-Chancellor of Queen Mary College, University of London, last September, he announced that he was 'not prepared to see our students manhandled by the police'. His predecessor, Lord Goodman, had been similarly concerned about student rights. In March, when he left office, he made public a letter to the Home Secretary in which he objected to the 'alarming increase' in arrests during demonstrations. He added: 'I am sure you will agree that the time has come for us to enter into a dialogue aimed at achieving a better understanding and co-operation between the police and the universities.'\\nSuch statements may sound very innocuous. But they go far beyond mere protests. They suggest that the Vice-Chancellors feel themselves entitled to play some role in determining the level of police action, and even to criticise it if they think it excessive. For the first time since the great wave of student disorder in 1968, they are saying that they\",\n          \"of Bootle Di can't know PRINCESS Diana knows nothing about the lives of ordinary, everyday people and of inner city deprivation and squalor.\\nThe Princess Royal was yesterday presented with a gift of two cards by the children in the nursery class at St James School in Woolton Road, where she visited to open the school's new nursery unit last Friday.\\nMrs Lee said: \\\"We were thrilled that the princess chose our Christmas card designs as they have been hand-drawn by our youngest children. We felt it was very appropriate for her to have them because she is so interested in helping disadvantaged families.\\\"\\nThe school has received \\u00a310,000 from the National Lottery to fund the new nursery unit which is housed within an existing classroom. There are 26 full time places for three and four year olds available and another 18 part-time places for those over five years old.\\nThe nursery unit was officially opened on November 17 and Mrs Lee said: \\\"We had a special opening ceremony and invited members of the local community including some parents whose children will be attending the nursery unit.\\n\\\"It was really exciting for everyone involved as we all thought the nursery would be fantastic but actually seeing the building completed was something else altogether.\\n\\\"I think the fact that there is a waiting list already proves that this project was worthwhile.\\n\\\"At present we have 45 children on the waiting list and I am sure that number will grow now that the nursery unit is up and running.\\\"\\nThere are 13 staff working at the nursery and Mrs Lee said: \\\"They are fully qualified teachers who will provide high quality care for the children during their stay here.\\n\\\"This facility will help us to meet the needs of the local community because at present most of our pupils come from the surrounding area but we do get some from Liverpool and Southport.\\n\\\"We hope that many of these people will continue to send their children to the school when they move into the area. It is also a good way of bringing local people together and getting people to feel more involved in the life of the school.\\n\\\"One of our main aims is to improve the community spirit and hopefully this new venture will go some way towards achieving that aim.\",\n          \"How they always wanted to know what other men did. They were intrigued by the intimate details of their lives, especially when it came to sex.\\nI\\u2019ve had a couple women say to me: \\u201cSo tell me, how many times do you think about sex a day?\\u201d\\nMy answer was usually something like, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t count or anything, but probably at least once an hour.\\u201d\\nAnother time, my wife asked me if I ever fantasized about having sex with someone else. She\\u2019s a little jealous, and I suppose she has good reason to be, but I told her that I didn\\u2019t even consider it. There are a lot of beautiful women in this world, but there is only one woman who means everything to me.\\nThis is also true for guys. Sure, we might have a crush on a girl at school or work, and sometimes we let our imagination wander off into the land of sexual fantasy. But I can assure you that we never actually go through with it. We would never cheat on our wives or girlfriends. It wouldn\\u2019t happen.\\nThat\\u2019s why, whenever I hear a guy talking about his favorite porn star, I want to smack him upside the head. We all have preferences, sure, but none of us are willing to take our relationship with another person to that level.\\nBut since some people don\\u2019t seem to understand this, here are 5 things that every guy secretly wants from you.\\n1) He Wants You To Be Open With Your Feelings\\nAs much as we hate to admit it, we love it when girls open up to us emotionally. Whenever I\\u2019m really comfortable around a girl, I start telling her stories about myself\\u2014stories that I normally keep bottled up inside.\\nWe need to feel that you care about us, not just physically. If you want to make your man happy, then show him that you can share your feelings with him too.\\n2) He Wants You To Be Sexually Active\\nThis goes without saying, right? Everyone knows that men get turned on by sexy women.\\nBut sometimes we have to remind ourselves of that fact. It\\u2019s easy to forget because most guys spend so much time thinking about their penises that they lose sight of the rest of their bodies.\\n3) He Wants To See What Else Is Out There\\nAsking your man if he\\u2019s been with any other women doesn\\u2019t mean that you\\u2019re trying to catch him out. In fact, it shows that you trust him enough to ask such a personal question.\\nThe truth is, most men will lie if you ask them straight out whether they\\u2019ve slept with anyone else. So instead, try asking him what kind of women he finds attractive. This way, you\\u2019ll find out whether or not he thinks you fit into his ideal type.\\n4) He Wants To Hear About His Past Relationships\\nYou might not realize it, but hearing about past relationships is super important to us. Not only does it help us learn more about each other, but it gives us insight into our own character flaws.\\nWhen we talk about our exes, we tend to focus on what went wrong between us rather than what made them special. And while this information isn\\u2019t always useful (because no matter how bad things got between you two, there must have been something good somewhere), it still helps us grow as individuals.\\n5) He Wants To Know That He Matters To You\\nIn order to feel appreciated, men need reassurance that they matter to others. Even though we may appear confident on the outside, deep down inside we still worry about whether or not we matter to those closest to us.\\nIf you\\u2019d like to let your man know how important he is to you, simply tell him that you love him! Whether he says it back or not, hearing those words will go a long way toward making him feel loved and accepted by you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"8 Epochs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 84,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"They feared bodies would be shifted in and out in full view of young children and collected a 1,000-signature petition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FIC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
