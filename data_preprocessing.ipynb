services for the under fives\\nAttempting to integrate under fives\\nPolicy in Islington, 1983\\u20138\\nMargaret Boushel, Clare Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach\\nDuring the 1980s Margaret Boushel, Claire Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach worked in the London borough of Islington within social services for pre-school children.\\nThis chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered.\\nThe first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983.\\nThe next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy.\\nThe third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services.\\nThe fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority.\\nThe chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination.\\nBACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983\\nIslington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000.\\nIn 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis.\\nBetween 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority.\\nThe Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties.\\nUnlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free.\\nChildren were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand.\\nThe Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs.\\nBy 1983 it had half that number on roll.\\nSince 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities.\\nIn addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties.\\nSome integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation.\\nWorkers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup.\\nIn addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities.\\nIn 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2.\\nThe children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers.\\nResidential units\\nBy 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings.\\nFor example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care.\\nParents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home.\\nBy 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road.\\nThe Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties.\\nThe Community Health Team\\nThe Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision.\\nIt included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor.\\nThey were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school.\\nThis group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues.\\nDiscussion of services to individual children also took place.\\nThis included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options.\\nOften a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action.\\nThe Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential.\\nThey were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community.\\nThey gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children.\\nBecause of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision.\\nThe Special Services Team\\nIn the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children.\\nThese social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team.\\nThey all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered.\\nThey were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability.\\nWhen a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs.\\nThis might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage.\\nInstead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington.\\nFirst, the post was not attached to any specialist institution.\\nThere was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery.\\nSecond, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities.\\nThird, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs.\\nThere was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents.\\nATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY\\nThe Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort.\\nThis led to the initiation of an under-fives review.\\nThe review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership.\\nIt proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time.\\nDay care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents.\\nThe review had made no mention of children with special needs.\\nThe specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children.\\nThey interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders.\\nBroadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice.\\nParents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were.\\nMany commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer.\\nOne Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good.\\nShe fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended.\\nBecause the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead.\\nShe commented:\\nI had to fight every step of the way for this.\\nNo one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it.\\nI knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children.\\nIt doesn't matter that he's not like them.\\nI know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say.\\nParents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way.\\nSome parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs.\\nDefinitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English.\\nThis made the survey difficult to interpret.\\nThe findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome.\\nThese ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee.\\nThe conference: \\u2018A place for all our children'\\nAs a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision.\\nPrior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate.\\nThese included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers.\\nEach of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending.\\nAbout 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985.\\nWorkshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information.\\nThe conference made the following recommendations:\\n1\\nFor a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources.\\n2\\nFor children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised.\\n3\\nFor employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers.\\n4\\nFor availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations.\\n5\\nFor enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs.\\n6\\nFor priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision.\\n7\\nFor training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders.\\n8\\nFor greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision.\\n9\\nFor therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington.\\nIt was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented.\\nFinally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective.\\nThe Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference.\\nThe message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution.\\nUnfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy.\\nThe core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected.\\nAs a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague.\\nThe sub-committee\\nIn the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration.\\nThe group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups.\\nBattles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear.\\nMany community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration.\\nThey said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes.\\nThey also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time.\\nIf children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers.\\nTheir aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community!\\nInterestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019.\\nTHE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION\\nDespite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen!\\nThere were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive.\\nDay-care provision\\nSuccessful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual.\\nIt involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed.\\nEven when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes.\\nThis could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities.\\nPlaygroups\\nFollowing the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly.\\nTo some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs.\\nBecause of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working.\\nDespite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs.\\nTheir staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents.\\nSome children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years.\\nDay centres\\nSome individual placements were being made in children's day centres.\\nAlthough it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable.\\nAccess was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs.\\nThey had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available.\\nSome extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres.\\nSometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child.\\nIn some cases extra support has been unnecessary.\\nChild-minding\\nA few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place.\\nThis led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system.\\nThe specialist nursery\\nThe Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap.\\nThis could have provided opportunities for structural change and review.\\nThese never took place.\\nSenior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives.\\nWhat did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links.\\nThere was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children.\\nThe nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives.\\nA consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities.\\nAs a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result.\\nResidential provision\\nAs a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987.\\nThese included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults.\\nMost of these recommendations affected services for under fives.\\nRespite care\\nThe Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families.\\nAgain this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision.\\nFollowing the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned.\\nPriority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough.\\nAccess\\nAt the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access.\\nSince then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible.\\nOn completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments.\\nDisability awareness\\nA small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children.\\nThe course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care.\\nParents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course.\\nIt was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful.\\nStaff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided.\\nBARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM\\nFrom 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge.\\nReorganising social services\\nAfter 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy.\\nField, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated.\\nThe Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas.\\nThe way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration.\\nThree different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities!\\nEach Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload.\\nIt was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work.\\nThe issue of integration began to lose its visibility.\\nAttitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular.\\nThe cuts\\nAs a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years.\\nCuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed.\\nUnder-fives services were not identified as a priority.\\nInstead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss.\\nThe care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres.\\nIt is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise.\\nThe danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers.\\nThe abolition of the ILEA\\nLegislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London.\\nFor Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide.\\nIn particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools.\\nThe borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition.\\nThese included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives.\\nBefore the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways.\\nThe paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision.\\nThe document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail.\\nThe only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality.\\nThe author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019.\\nHe gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools.\\nHe also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism.\\nIt so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign.\\nFinally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration.\\nMost people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it.\\nIn such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided.\\nThe abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field.\\nThe under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department.\\nThis would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise.\\nIt contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989.\\nThe number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision.\\nNeither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities.\\nIt was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments.\\nDespite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education.\\nIn such a situation the future for integration looked bleak.\\nThe transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee.\\nThis committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education.\\nSuch a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group.\\nThe cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post.\\nWhen the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school.\\nOnce again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again.\\nShortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely.\\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\\nIn 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019.\\nThere was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help.\\nParents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs.\\nA coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop.\\nChildren with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years.\\nUntil the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity.\\nStaff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school.\\nThe local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2.\\nWithin social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units.\\nIt demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative.\\nPlacements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents.\\nToo often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process.\\nAt the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019.\\nSome days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn.\\nBecause council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place.\\nCost is not everything.\\nIt is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes.\\nIt is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services.\\nThe shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued.\\nCommunity play\\nVeronica Hanson\\nIn this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning.\\nThere is national funding for the scheme.\\nVeronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMembers of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible.\\nCounty \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group.\\nOnce a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided.\\nPlaygroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child.\\nPlaygroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader.\\nThe groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level.\\nFINDING THEIR WAY\\nChildren with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs.\\nTwo counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s.\\nIn 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol .\\nThis document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible.\\nThe Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families.\\nMembers of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group.\\nDevelopment of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers.\\nPPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start.\\nIf integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning.\\nEvery local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released.\\nPPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan.\\nThis involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again.\\nLIAISON\\nIn 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties.\\nBy 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county.\\nFunding for the schemes is varied.\\nEvery county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses.\\nEvery county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap.\\nUnderstandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding.\\nAlternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising.\\nTwo schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988.\\nEach PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator.\\nThe financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child.\\nPlacement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees.\\nA toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme.\\nThe referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups.\\nCoordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team.\\nEssential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared.\\nSTATEMENTS\\nThe playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour.\\nThe playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement.\\nShe will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere.\\nThe educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care.\\nPPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course.\\nTraining opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered.\\nShort \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration.\\nLIFE AFTER SCHOOL\\nAn international perspective on transition\\nJohn Fish\\nIn this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties.\\nHe discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom.\\nHe argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address.\\nA number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described.\\nFinally he considers the part education should play.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nTransition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade.\\nAt first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends.\\nThese show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment.\\nAs a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible.\\nA smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled.\\nIt presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups.\\nIn many instances expectations have been too low.\\nWhen decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited.\\nRecent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life.\\nFor more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled.\\nA number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988).\\nAlthough the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process.\\nThe work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process.\\nIt is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult.\\nThere is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed.\\nFinally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail.\\nIf the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential.\\nTHE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING\\nThe educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired.\\nIn addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive.\\nIt is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work.\\nHigher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989).\\nThis is a major reason for attention to transition.\\nBut, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7.\\nAlthough there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it.\\nIn a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18.\\nIn Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties.\\nTHE CHANGING CONTEXTS\\nThere is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom.\\nThose responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place.\\nThe Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution.\\nIt also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important.\\nSocial and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986.\\nThe parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies.\\nSections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present.\\nThe Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned.\\nThis will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan.\\n\\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions.\\nThe movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential.\\nChanges are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities.\\nFinally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils.\\nThese will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it.\\nEducation can only contribute one element to successful transition.\\nTo be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends.\\nCOORDINATION AND CONTINUITY\\nAlthough an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important.\\nFor a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial.\\nTransition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation.\\nDuring the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children.\\nAfter that period there are many independent contributors.\\nThe secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies.\\nThis confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients.\\nFor example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability.\\nSome definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others.\\nAfter school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions.\\nThere are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients.\\nThis is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served.\\nThis may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies.\\nWith so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process.\\nIndeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable.\\nEven if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition.\\nThe OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed:\\nEmployment, useful work and valued activity.\\nPersonal autonomy, independent living and adult status.\\nSocial interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation.\\nAdult roles within the family including marriage.\\nProgress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration.\\nTo pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective.\\nContinuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition.\\nOECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital.\\nMAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION\\nA number of issues are common to national and international contexts.\\nThey provide a useful agenda for discussion:\\nThe starting point\\nConsideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education.\\nThe place of education is also important.\\nAttendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped.\\nThe importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning.\\nInter-agency planning and collaboration\\nThe United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration.\\nResponsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities.\\nEmpowerment\\nTo fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations.\\nEffective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities.\\nSimilarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress.\\nProfessional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment.\\nTransitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life.\\nBut the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage.\\nProfessionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment.\\nAmbivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment.\\nWork with parents\\nLittle professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period.\\nParents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress.\\nAs work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood.\\nSupporting arrangements are rarely readily available.\\nThe importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated.\\nAssessment\\nTransitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual.\\nAssessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need.\\nIt is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations.\\nToo often decisions are:\\n1\\nbased on past performance;\\n2\\nconfined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and\\n3\\nseldom based on experience and training in real situations.\\nNew legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment.\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services.\\nContinuity of support\\nIn the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available.\\nThe development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries.\\nThere is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition.\\nProfessional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated.\\nIt is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity.\\nSuch services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice.\\nINNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES\\nThere are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom.\\nThose reported here are from other countries.\\nThis is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition.\\nThe final years of school\\nThe work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al .\\n1989, Wehman et al .\\n1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school.\\nThe Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al .\\n1989) gives details of school programmes.\\nStudents with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA.\\nThus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States.\\nSailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches.\\nThis starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations.\\nExperiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria.\\nVocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills.\\nAn individual transition plan\\nThe Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States.\\nAn Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this.\\nThe purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families.\\nThe features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor.\\nA guide or point of reference\\nBecause of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families.\\nIn a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b).\\nOne which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark.\\nA Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school.\\nThe Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience.\\nHe or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school.\\nThe time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another.\\nSupport can be offered for up to four years after school.\\nThe Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families.\\nSupported employment\\nOne of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities.\\nResearch in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited.\\nSupported open employment is much more successful.\\nThe Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States.\\nThe importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations.\\nYoung people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams.\\nSalary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility.\\nSupport teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems.\\nResults are impressive.\\nIn a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment.\\nTHE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION\\nIt is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition.\\nThey also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education.\\nMany of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative.\\nThe labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school.\\nTo increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available.\\nThe possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge.\\nUnless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult.\\nVouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive.\\nA recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital.\\nParents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees.\\nThis means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula.\\nBut, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person.\\nThe development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education.\\nSupporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice.\\nDevelopments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit.\\nIts publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nPost-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for.\\nIn the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre.\\nNow the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy.\\nFor the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community.\\nWhat is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access.\\nHowever, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment.\\nResearch in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future.\\nOnly by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need.\\nThus, the charity image of disability must disappear.\\nHigher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity.\\nThe form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review.\\nThe rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life\\nJenny Corbett and Len Barton\\nIn this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties.\\nThey argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition.\\nThey discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training.\\nThey describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThis chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life.\\nIt is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977).\\nIntegration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries.\\n\\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living.\\nThe extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019.\\nThis broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area.\\nIt also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted.\\nWe are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making.\\nCONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION'\\nA failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue.\\nIf integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged.\\nGiven the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs.\\nThe question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one.\\nGovernment documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language.\\nThe Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a\\nwidely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people.\\n(DES 1978: 99)\\nand the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that:\\nThe integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible.\\n(Council of Europe 1986: 9)\\njust as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019.\\nAdulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019.\\n\\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated?\\nAs it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives.\\nAbberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference.\\nHe claims, moreover, that such a view is\\nnot only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people.\\n(Abberley 1989: 56)\\nThe argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency.\\nOpportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic.\\nBarnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies.\\nThis research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision.\\nWhere young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to.\\nStaff encouraged debate but these users\\n appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026\\nThe more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate.\\n(Barnes 1990: 136)\\nIt is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult.\\n\\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel.\\nHowever, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular.\\nGriffiths argues that\\nAdulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone.\\nInstead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years.\\n(Griffiths 1989: 5)\\nThere is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups.\\nfor those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019.\\nFor an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy.\\nRecent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990).\\nThe majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances.\\nHostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990).\\nThis form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual.\\nWallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past.\\nTRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION\\nThe whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic.\\nThe period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status.\\nYet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum.\\nThe curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles.\\nBy contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study.\\nIn the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible.\\nThus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship.\\nThe language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people.\\nYet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them:\\nJealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down.\\n\\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves.\\nAlternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs.\\nIt is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course.\\n(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9)\\nThe authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements.\\nThey even suggest that\\nSuch problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course.\\nIt is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations.\\n(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72)\\nIf this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage:\\nIndeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities.\\nNaturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable.\\nIf nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made.\\n(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72)\\nWithin this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation.\\nA common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education.\\nDespite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes.\\nSocial and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status.\\nAlthough notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989).\\nSuch \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges.\\nA move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process.\\nHowever, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation.\\nfay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27).\\nFay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27).\\nAn invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26).\\nTRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING\\nAnother aspect of transition is that from school to youth training.\\nThis offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts.\\nThese programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability.\\nHollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes:\\nSome young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs.\\nAs such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum.\\n(Hollands 1990: 73)\\nIn supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990).\\nAs this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise:\\nso that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in.\\n(Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97)\\nThis \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice.\\n\\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process:\\nPerhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it.\\n(Gleeson 1990: 188)\\nYouth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority:\\nGeorge, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019\\nOthers spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019.\\nIt was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic.\\n(Lee et al .\\n1990: 133)\\nWithin this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991).\\nIn exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that.\\nYoung people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment.\\nThe work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation.\\n(Bates 1991: 1)\\nFor some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990).\\nTransition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices.\\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\\nTransition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities.\\nfor some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989).\\nTheir \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991).\\nThe reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989).\\nIf they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience.\\nNewman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme.\\nHe was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme.\\nAs it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post.\\nWithout initial support, this transition would have been impractical.\\nClass, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads.\\nThe level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent.\\nThe rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period.\\nMuch of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world.\\nIt is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood.\\nSupporting special needs in further education\\nMaureen Turnham\\nSince 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college.\\nIn this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college.\\nShe questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes.\\nShe reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners.\\nIMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION\\nMy mother saw it.\\nMy colleague saw it and cut it out for me.\\nI didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children.\\nLecturer!\\nI remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university.\\nMy quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college.\\nMy initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump.\\nUpon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019.\\nSeveral of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch.\\nThey had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough.\\nIt was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019.\\nSome of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families.\\nThey all knew my younger sister, for example.\\nShe went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left.\\nSome first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators?\\nMy knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant.\\nI was thrown into a jungle of new jargon.\\nThe language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students.\\nCollege induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019.\\nAfter all, I had nine years' experience in special education.\\nSurely, further education could not be so different?\\nTHE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION\\nSeven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed.\\nOur college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes.\\nThe lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019.\\nFor a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them.\\nTalking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school.\\nStories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate.\\nThe life preparation course\\nIn 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties.\\nThis provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres.\\nFor many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education.\\nA former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe.\\nIt began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!).\\nThe building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator.\\nOpportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning.\\nFor instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines.\\nThe annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors.\\nDuring queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue.\\nI have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else.\\nThe mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part.\\nWhile I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings.\\nSomething as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term.\\nHowever, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties.\\nHow nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely.\\nJoint craft\\nConscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area.\\nIt was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week.\\nThe nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration.\\nIt was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects.\\nThe projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion.\\nAlthough this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs.\\nOne unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships.\\nThe increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit.\\nFlushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students.\\nThe results were disappointing.\\nWith hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor.\\nThey felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nThe outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups.\\nDuring a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students.\\nThey felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nI would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally.\\nIt seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought.\\nThere could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment.\\nWe now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course.\\nFeeling established\\nOur life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses.\\nThis was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities.\\nA pat on the back!\\nIt felt like confirmation that we had got it right.\\nThis seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit.\\nOther colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties.\\nThis  group had met almost every week for nearly two years.\\nThe national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988).\\nCurriculum principles\\nFrom the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019.\\nEvery opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized.\\nFor instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students.\\nThe possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners.\\nThe college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons.\\nOne example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff.\\nStudents have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union.\\nThey are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites.\\nTravelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre.\\nSupervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants.\\nIn general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties.\\nHowever, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019.\\nThe whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites.\\nWe share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff.\\nAn early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019.\\nWe talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!).\\nThis mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building.\\nWith hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students.\\nOne route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf.\\nSelf-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote.\\nThe Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989).\\nSelection procedures\\nAt present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time.\\nWe didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course.\\nI suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students.\\nAlso, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities.\\nI can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019.\\nWhen she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019.\\nThis represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me.\\nI was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision.\\nI thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties.\\nHowever, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me.\\nOur selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour.\\nOur selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable.\\nNational reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11).\\nIn considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour.\\nThe life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would.\\nThe possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners.\\nIt is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with?\\nCOUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION\\nThere are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019.\\nHowever, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change.\\nIt is a lengthy and wearing process.\\nAttempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality.\\nI believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019.\\nI believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice.\\nOur college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document.\\nI am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee.\\nWhen the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last!\\nUnfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document.\\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago.\\nI failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down.\\nOnce again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019.\\nSenior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system.\\nNegative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did.\\nI have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am.\\nI no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students.\\nAlternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026\\nI/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different.\\nIt's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019.\\nApart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing.\\nI refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019.\\nStudents with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task.\\nAs a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate.\\nWithin a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense.\\nWe do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible.\\nQuestions of physical access\\nThe physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances.\\nAt the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped.\\nIn the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes.\\nPhysical barriers to integration often receive much publicity.\\nHowever, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail.\\nThe ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency!\\nI discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards.\\nA subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left.\\nAny \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted.\\nRegrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019.\\nShort-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock.\\nTHE FUTURE\\nThere are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning.\\nThere are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community.\\nThe need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019.\\nVery recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019.\\nThey did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs.\\nThey are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person.\\nThe current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students.\\nMy earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity.\\nI obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability.\\nHowever, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings.\\nMany changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners.\\nThese are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health.\\nIn a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely.\\nPutting theory into practice is far from simple.\\nNevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone.\\nA hard journey in the right direction\\nExperiencing life beyond an institution\\nLinda Shaw\\nIn this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend.\\nHer knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view.\\nElizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019.\\nLinda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life.\\nDespite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nElizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution.\\nThe move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties.\\nI was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate.\\nI have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers.\\nThe women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy.\\nSTARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE\\nMore than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities.\\nThe women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people.\\nTheir daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility.\\nAs well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend.\\nHealth service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service.\\nNeighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful.\\nThe women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved.\\nThe realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home.\\nThe first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible.\\nOne member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds.\\nThe balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted.\\nStaff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers.\\nFrom the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own.\\nShe coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities.\\n\\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself.\\nHelen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding.\\nElizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult.\\nOn many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative.\\nAt the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom.\\nShe cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached.\\nShe was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019\\nprofessional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters.\\nIn those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress.\\nThe basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019.\\nWIDENING HORIZONS\\nLooking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned.\\nAs the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines.\\nThe women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry.\\nThey have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over.\\nAlthough lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody.\\nA typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music.\\nHelen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing.\\nSome form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme.\\nSuch social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis.\\nAround the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy.\\nThey had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church.\\nA trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by.\\nElizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home.\\nBecause of Helen.\\nGoing out.\\nLikes seeing Linda.\\nLikes the workers.\\nBecause of my car.\\nGoing to church.\\nHaving visitors.\\nHaving a fish tank.\\nElizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment.\\nShe says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden.\\nShe does not want to do housework.\\nHelen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday.\\nHer speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away.\\nShe'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions.\\nShe is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations.\\nShe often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary.\\nHelen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff.\\nHelen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant.\\nIn general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically.\\nElizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly.\\nFor a start she looks different.\\nShe is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age.\\nShe slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner.\\nShe says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks.\\nShe can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor.\\nShe is exceptionally good company when she is happy.\\nShe is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties.\\nShe works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019.\\nShe expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection.\\nHow to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers.\\nElizabeth is learning to speak up for herself.\\nShe says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time.\\nI received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019\\nShe is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community.\\nAt times it surely is very difficult for her.\\nShe still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing.\\nA SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK\\nCommunity care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency.\\nElizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net.\\nIt is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve.\\nThe women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight.\\nBehind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems.\\nDuring the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency.\\nNone of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat.\\nI left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction.\\nI was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions.\\nI reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends.\\nThe period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat.\\nAt one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis.\\nThe consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages.\\nMembers of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women.\\nIt is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home.\\nThe effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services.\\nThe IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress.\\nIt is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service.\\nThe system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress.\\nThe written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan.\\nThe Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval.\\nSupport staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity.\\nThey are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities.\\nThe lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down.\\nWhile the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression.\\nHelen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level.\\nAccording to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019.\\nSupport workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties.\\n\\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker.\\n\\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019\\nA senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019.\\nWhen new staff were appointed development could move ahead again.\\nRegarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019\\nElizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life.\\n\\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say.\\n\\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019.\\nThey have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community.\\nAnd while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care.\\nCONCLUSION\\nElizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties.\\nThere has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved.\\nThe new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life.\\nOpportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital.\\nFrom the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community.\\nTHE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES\\nFools and heretics\\nParents' views of professionals\\nChris Goodey\\nIn this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators.\\nHe argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being.\\nIt is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents.\\nHe supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them.\\nHe concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all.\\nA HUMAN FAILING\\nWhat is it to be human?\\nThe segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately.\\nProfessionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide.\\nWe as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group.\\nWe do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do.\\nWe do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019.\\nWe do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species).\\nAlongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me.\\nIn our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put.\\nExpert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective.\\nBut in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described.\\nWe have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not.\\nWe then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists.\\nThe appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards.\\nIt gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary.\\nIf it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all.\\nPhilosophies clash and compete.\\nAs far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019.\\nThe excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one.\\nThis necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise.\\nHistory has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy.\\nThe Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one.\\nIn our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion.\\nNatural experts?\\nThe includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group.\\n\\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one.\\nI put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood.\\nThere is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one.\\nBut if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts.\\nAs one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019\\nConversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species.\\nMost parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species.\\nThis observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance.\\nFor parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is.\\nIt is a way of life.\\nDeny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence.\\nThey will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019.\\nIn the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities.\\nIt is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability.\\nBecause it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form.\\nTo borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them.\\nThey contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day.\\nIn short, they are a colonised people.\\nBut in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them.\\nThe stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019,\\n\\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species.\\nThey believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019\\nWORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT\\nMy opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research.\\nBetween 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7.\\nI had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991).\\nBefore I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families.\\nSecond, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature.\\nAfter beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike.\\nA shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes.\\nIt may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another.\\nBut we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience.\\nIt became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words.\\nParents as truth tellers\\nEven in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth.\\nI may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal.\\nI decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream.\\nIf they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia.\\nIf they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned.\\nTo accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nIn what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement.\\nSHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION\\n\\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28).\\nBernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026\\nI had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that.\\nI thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome.\\nMentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would.\\nEvery one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences.\\nFor Bernadette, it's amusing.\\nFrom this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent.\\nPat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019\\nAnd I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019\\nAnd he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it.\\nHe wasn't looking at me.\\nHe was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway.\\nI mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs].\\nAnd I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing.\\nAnd then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over.\\nPat has reasons not to mind.\\nThe baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth.\\nIn addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities.\\nBoth she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue.\\nWhat about those who haven't?\\nRita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019\\nAnd then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019\\nI said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019\\nShe said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019\\nI said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026\\nSo I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward.\\nNone of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026\\nYeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her.\\nAs soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026\\nThe exact feelings\\u2026\\nI wanted her to die\\u2026\\nAnd I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her.\\nNow this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one.\\n\\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked?\\nIn the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women).\\nRita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances.\\nThe baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days.\\nSince Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in.\\nEventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019\\nShe is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures.\\nMost importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere:\\nRita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026\\nI don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed.\\nI was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol.\\nIf we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them.\\nI'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026\\nThey're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way.\\nThey're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be?\\nThey're just there , you know.\\nLike many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes.\\nSuch parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019).\\nBetween the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances.\\nSome parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing.\\nSome may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died.\\nFor others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc.\\nAnd none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment.\\n\\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking.\\nThis self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on.\\nWhat needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification.\\nBrian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems.\\n\\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS?\\nFor many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead.\\nMany doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026\\nThese feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome.\\n(Cunningham 1982: 31, 39)\\nA couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed.\\nShe tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother.\\nSharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal.\\nAntenatal classes should talk about it.\\nAlthough I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby?\\nAnd he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us.\\nBut you've got to think about it if it does happen to you.\\nI mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it.\\nThere's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens.\\nDave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told.\\nIf you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026\\nLooking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean?\\nBecause it is another world.\\nBecause what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening.\\nFor both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite.\\nMany parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion.\\nPhil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026\\nThey put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything.\\nI grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now?\\nAnd they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see.\\nI said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home.\\nStart life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019\\nThat afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026\\nI mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons].\\nAnd after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place.\\nJust as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019.\\nHelen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it.\\nSo that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him.\\nThe majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified).\\nCunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,.\\nIt is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with.\\nPerhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability.\\nFor the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy.\\nFor the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it.\\nThis widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies.\\nIn medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion.\\nYet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive.\\nSome who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital.\\nOthers had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating.\\nEven where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping.\\nJeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them.\\nI'm not sure, though.\\nI'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again.\\nSimilarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour.\\nNo doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged.\\nIn this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue.\\nPat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they?\\nI mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal.\\nBut why do that?\\nI mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society?\\nI mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all?\\nIf we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it?\\nThe world of normality is redefined.\\nNo longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience.\\nLUCKY LEPERS\\n\\u2018I am fortunate.\\nI do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16).\\nKathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us.\\nI think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like.\\nI didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me.\\nI didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could.\\nI'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again.\\nBefore I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose.\\nBut I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you

Grugeon\\nElizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family.\\nShe was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand.\\nBalbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nMY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY\\nA long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh.\\nHe was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist.\\nThe head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language.\\nThey were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019.\\nHis transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them.\\nThis chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective.\\nI had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme.\\nBalbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me.\\nOver the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family.\\nBy the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school.\\nMr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence.\\nMr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue.\\nHowever, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this.\\nThey were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture.\\nThe two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages.\\nBalbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English.\\nAs both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising.\\nI reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement.\\nIn fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy.\\nMrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it.\\nShe continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English.\\nI wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family.\\nHowever, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped.\\nThere were complaints about his behaviour.\\nHe did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children.\\nAt home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house.\\nIn the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined.\\nBut the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder.\\nThe staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language.\\nHis mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him.\\nMrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress.\\nShe wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English.\\nShe and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read.\\nHe had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read.\\nWhenever they visited me I listened to him reading.\\nHe was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension.\\nI felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary.\\nI remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals.\\nHe could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape.\\nAt 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader.\\nThe idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him.\\nBalbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden.\\nMrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate.\\nI was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life.\\nThe list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019.\\nThe Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge.\\nAlmost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible.\\nLetters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them.\\nSchools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents.\\nEnd of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019.\\nHowever phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her.\\nShe interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one.\\nOn one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers.\\nThe teacher was brusque and busy.\\nShe brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that.\\nYou can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019\\nMrs Singh was not satisfied.\\nShe wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book.\\nHis teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read.\\nHe produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently.\\nThe teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's.\\nLooking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that.\\nThe teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019.\\nShe continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019.\\nNone of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019\\nLater, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was.\\nLooking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019\\nThe school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school.\\nThere had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's.\\nMrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions.\\nIn the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate.\\nThe psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money.\\nBoth ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh.\\nThere were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money.\\nNeither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue.\\nMrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role.\\nTHE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER\\nMy contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh.\\nThe head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress.\\nThe class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019.\\nTheir concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind.\\nThe head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs.\\nStandardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019.\\nAs a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder.\\nThey now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say.\\nThe same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears.\\nI realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school.\\nAs an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role.\\nI kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education.\\nMarch 3: The initial meeting\\nMeeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school.\\nThe head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed.\\nHe explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better.\\nHe stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up.\\nHe seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer.\\nThis was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process.\\nBoth the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs.\\nBy suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself.\\nShe became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault.\\nShe cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019\\nWhen she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed.\\nShe felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough.\\nShe listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure.\\nThey stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband.\\nThe first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again.\\nA date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them.\\nWhat I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away.\\nAfter she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail.\\nIn the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late.\\nIn Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner.\\nThere were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer.\\nHe was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly.\\nAs he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019\\nThey had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents.\\nYet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned.\\nIt was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county.\\nAs the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him.\\nThus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible.\\nLater on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home.\\nOver tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion.\\nMrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years.\\nShe was depressed and angry with Balbinder.\\nShe had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day.\\nShe clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested.\\nHowever we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time.\\nThe difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning.\\nOne from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school.\\nFortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school.\\nI suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening.\\nMrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise.\\nAnother letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip.\\nWe discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope.\\nTo his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday.\\nAt nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested.\\nIn the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher.\\nHer school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem.\\nIn her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year.\\nShe also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back.\\nAt this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed.\\nIf the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment.\\nOn the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day.\\nThe school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers.\\nThe middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents.\\nIf Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school.\\nOn the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist.\\nIf Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress.\\nMarch 9: Visiting Cedars School\\nThe head made us very welcome.\\nHe began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school.\\nHe stressed the normality of the children who attended it.\\nHe explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed.\\nHe explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning.\\nCedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training.\\nAll of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties.\\nAnother special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter.\\nBalbinder would be in a group with ten children.\\nMrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head.\\nI am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar.\\nAfter a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019\\nThe head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively.\\nThere is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress.\\nAll parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019\\nThey review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week.\\nAt the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September.\\nAt this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019\\nThe head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem.\\nHe told them that many children learned more slowly.\\nHe illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way.\\nHe explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears.\\nMr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology.\\nHe went on to tell them about the school.\\nThe children started at 5 and could stay until 16.\\nThey could also leave at any time.\\nEach part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group.\\nAt 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work.\\nSeveral of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment.\\nHe then took us round the school.\\nThe lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment.\\nThe rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant.\\nIt was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment.\\nI was particularly impressed by the art room.\\nThe workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers.\\nOutside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park.\\nPart of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop.\\nThere was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field.\\nThere seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group.\\nAfter the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement.\\nHe explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019\\nThe school had an open-door policy.\\nHe then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school.\\nHe explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask).\\nHe explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place.\\nThe educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder.\\nHe himself would visit Balbinder at his present school.\\nHe stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right.\\nNothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019\\nThen Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall.\\nAgain, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019\\nMr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019\\nThe head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help.\\nHowever they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019.\\nMrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder.\\nShe seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019\\nThe head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more.\\nInstead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school.\\nHe told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children.\\nMrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019\\nThe head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019.\\n\\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively.\\nThe head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019.\\nIts job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019.\\nHe gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out.\\nWe rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days.\\nBoth Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school.\\nMr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped.\\nThis had clearly been worrying them both.\\nWhen we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move.\\nIt was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences.\\nIt all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands.\\nDespite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged.\\nLooking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it.\\nThey would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019\\nTerms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them.\\nThe school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019\\nNeither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role.\\nMarch 12: Coping with the procedure\\nI met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room.\\nMrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars.\\nI tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents.\\nThe educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex.\\nHe told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits.\\nThere would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action.\\nThe sheer amount of information seemed daunting.\\nI arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh.\\nWhen I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure:\\nThe learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation.\\nTherefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement.\\nThe letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019\\nAn enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process.\\nIn this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019\\nSince they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them.\\nGoing through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019\\nAll these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier.\\nAs they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream.\\nI did not feel so optimistic.\\nThe brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019.\\nJune 5: Testing\\nVisited Mrs Singh at home.\\nShe told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist.\\nBalbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles.\\nThe psychologist had said he was good with his hands.\\nMrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about.\\nShe said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019.\\nI was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019.\\nShe went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school.\\nShe was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden.\\nHer husband was away in India for three weeks.\\nPeople were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door.\\nWe spent a lot of time discussing this.\\nIn some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time.\\nPerhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands.\\nWe agreed to meet at school the following week.\\nJune 10: The information for the Statement\\nFirst, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc.\\nThere was a brief account of professional intervention to date.\\nBefore starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist.\\nThen, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class.\\nHe had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good.\\nHe had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read.\\nThe head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this.\\nI think Mrs Singh understood.\\nBalbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds.\\nHis progress was slow because his retention was poor.\\nAt this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019\\nThe head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019\\nMrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things.\\nThe head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi.\\nThere were discrepancies in the report.\\nOn the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art!\\nHaving said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher).\\nThe head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three.\\nIn order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts.\\nIn his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time.\\nThe head then commented on his social development.\\nHere they felt there had been much progress.\\nBalbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child.\\nThe head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education.\\nSince Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer.\\nThe head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him.\\nAlso he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly.\\nFurther he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus.\\nThey had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars.\\nThe head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind.\\nAs he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities.\\nAnd he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019\\nThe educational psychologist gave his report.\\nHe reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school.\\nHe stressed that he was a very likeable little boy.\\nHowever, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour.\\nHe ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult.\\nDespite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work.\\nHe was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group.\\nOften he watched other children and then followed and copied them.\\nThe psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing.\\nHe clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help.\\nWhen asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019.\\nOn the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding.\\nHe felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences.\\nAt this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019\\nShe felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi.\\nShe referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home.\\nShe found this very odd.\\nAt the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019.\\nThe educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups.\\nMrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him.\\nThe educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments.\\nIt seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them.\\nHe still had to have a medical.\\nThe head would speak to the school doctor that same day.\\nSocial Services would write to Mrs Singh.\\nThe procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term.\\nMrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to.\\nThe educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled.\\nThe head said he would chase up the documents.\\nMrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given.\\nI promised to go and see her again on Friday morning.\\nThroughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute.\\nHer anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made.\\nIt seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required.\\nJune 12\\nI visited Mr and Mrs Singh.\\nMrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point.\\nHe agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal.\\nHe listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place.\\nI said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow.\\nMrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor.\\nThey both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019.\\nWhat particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi.\\nMrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English.\\nBoth parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars.\\nJune 22: Acceptance\\nMrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars.\\nThey had understood the gist but needed help.\\nWe filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit.\\nThe school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term.\\nBalbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet.\\nJuly 15: Balbinder visits his new school\\nMrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School.\\nBalbinder was very subdued.\\nHis mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was.\\nHe had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December.\\nHe did not speak all the way.\\nMrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed.\\nWe were early and stood in the playground.\\nBalbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh.\\nWe went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events.\\nWe were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in.\\nThe head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing.\\nEach year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done.\\nThe classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children.\\nThere were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group.\\nMrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented.\\nIt was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do.\\nThe children were then asked to go out to play.\\nBalbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother.\\nHe had lost interest in the activities.\\nThere had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly.\\nIt looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently.\\nThe head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt.\\nWe were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in.\\nMrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school.\\nClasses were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant.\\nIt was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground.\\nBalbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it.\\nIn the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles.\\nIn the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables.\\nIt was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment.\\nThis filled Mrs Singh with horror.\\nShe was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read.\\nMrs Allinson was very reassuring.\\nHowever, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase.\\nEarlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019\\nOn the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more.\\nIn the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out.\\nIt was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on.\\nNo one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it.\\nIn all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure.\\nDecisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him.\\nOver the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self.\\nAt Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder.\\nShe and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English.\\nHowever, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw.\\nI wondered whether she had any misgivings.\\nThe distance will certainly be a  problem.\\nWhat she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine.\\nChoice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed.\\nPROGRESS REPORT\\nIn September Balbinder started at Cedars.\\nMy contact with the family became much less frequent.\\nTheir circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself.\\nThe job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them.\\nThe coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home.\\nBalbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day.\\nFor the first few weeks of term this was a problem.\\nMr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts.\\nHis brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not.\\nThe whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety.\\nBy half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening.\\nMrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships.\\nShe occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar.\\nThis showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about.\\nShe and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class.\\nShe had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything.\\nFrom January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys.\\nMy advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them.\\nBalbinder was no longer a worry.\\nHowever, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening.\\nShe wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress.\\nI was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own.\\nThe section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries.\\nHe had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him.\\nHis class teacher also felt that he was making progress.\\nBoth parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them.\\nThey had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements.\\nLooking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked.\\nHe had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on.\\nShe had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019.\\nIt seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing.\\nHis present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school.\\nThis was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group.\\nIn this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil.\\nHowever, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old.\\nHe could not read or write independently.\\nHis written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied.\\nThe question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered.\\nLater, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring.\\nHowever, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language.\\nShe reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,.\\nOut of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem.\\nHis re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly.\\nThe process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development.\\nIt has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school.\\nIn a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019.\\nHer lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019\\nBalbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for.\\nOn being a client\\nConflicting perspectives on assessment\\nDerrick Armstrong and David Galloway\\nThis chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act.\\nThe analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties.\\nIn each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants.\\nINTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER\\nPerhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients.\\nLikewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making.\\nThe former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook).\\nThe latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989).\\nDoes the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents?\\nOn face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework.\\nIn practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions.\\nMany parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying.\\nOn many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met.\\nIn the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act.\\nThis is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership.\\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES\\nEach of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents.\\nJohn: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem'\\nCooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child.\\nFor example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems.\\nRather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988).\\nBecause they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions.\\nIn John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school.\\nHowever, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse.\\nThe evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures.\\nIn drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface.\\n\\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019\\nMrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother.\\nI used to come home in tears.\\u2019\\nThe school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019\\nIn addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something.\\nShe stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019\\nShe recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019.\\nFollowing the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services.\\nAccording to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend:\\nAll different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in.\\nWhen I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused.\\nThey said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour.\\nI went home in tears.\\nThey asked me to take the children for a full medical.\\nI didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it.\\nI felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think.\\nFrom the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down.\\nAccording to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs.\\nConsequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019.\\nThe parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement.\\nThe parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete.\\nCooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs.\\nOn the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions.\\nThe definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions.\\nJohn's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals.\\nThe educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019\\nFor this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John.\\nThe EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019\\nOn the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions.\\n\\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019\\nLikewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019.\\nHe also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement.\\nMrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him.\\nNone the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations.\\nShe felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers.\\nTo her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish.\\nIt's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along.\\nI get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019\\nHowever strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome.\\nGeorge: who needs support?, what support is needed?\\nIn this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus.\\nWe show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents.\\nGeorge is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town.\\nAccording to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019\\nGeorge comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties.\\nOne of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder.\\nThe family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school.\\nGeorge was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019.\\nHis teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019.\\nIn school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children.\\nHe disturbs their work.\\u2019\\nThose behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home.\\nAt the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school.\\nAs the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist:\\n(a)\\nDisruptive behaviour in school.\\n(b)\\nManagement problems at home identified by the parents themselves.\\nWe can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established.\\nThe main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school.\\nThe EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school.\\nThe EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour.\\nHowever, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019\\nTheir stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school.\\nAs regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school.\\nThey acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home.\\nIt is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context.\\nWhen it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative .\\nIt was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations.\\nThis is illustrated in the following exchange:\\nMr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break.\\nI don't know if there's anything like that round here.\\nYou've got to think of the kids as well.\\nThey've never had any holiday.\\nEP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays.\\nI do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs.\\nNot because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings.\\nLet's try and get some help for you and the family.\\nThus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling.\\nOnce this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward.\\nThe different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting.\\nThe EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems.\\nMr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019\\nWhen questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school.\\nThey also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement.\\nMrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week.\\nElder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school].\\nIt makes him worse.\\nJohn says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019\\nYet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience.\\n\\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment.\\nI didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019\\nThe professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019\\nThe parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views.\\nIn a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs.\\nEP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding.\\nMrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school.\\nEP : That's where you would like him to go?\\nMr and Mrs Short : Yes.\\nEP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee.\\nMr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse.\\nThe psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation.\\nThis contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school.\\nThe psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him.\\n\\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them.\\nI think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019\\nThe psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019.\\nEP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look.\\nMr and Mrs Short : That's OK.\\nThe validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess.\\nIn the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019.\\nWhether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George.\\nMr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon.\\nMrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school.\\nIt's going to make him worse.\\nTom: refusing to play the game\\nOur third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control.\\nIt raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action.\\nTwelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children.\\nThis placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour.\\nAfter the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each.\\nMrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed.\\nMr Jones did not agree.\\nHe felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had.\\nTom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school.\\nThe EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required.\\nIn his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement.\\nTom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him.\\nInitially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour.\\nOnce the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned.\\nShe complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving.\\nPerhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome.\\nMrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy.\\nWhen she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019.\\nShe couldn't recollect having been informed of this.\\nIn any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019\\nMrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019\\nAccess to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced.\\nA lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated.\\nWhereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area.\\n\\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019\\nYet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling.\\nIn addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school.\\nShe had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties.\\nShe had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019.\\nYet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom.\\nNone the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling.\\nMrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019\\nOn the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests.\\nOnce the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law.\\nBut she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs.\\nShe had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power.\\nShe therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures.\\nShe moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit.\\nThe EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli .\\nAccording to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019.\\nDISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP\\nThe 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process.\\nIt identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment.\\nMoreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations.\\nA strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views.\\nIn practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence.\\nA number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process.\\nDyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families.\\nThis information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence.\\nChaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors.\\nGoacher et al .\\n(1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play.\\n\\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al .\\n1988: 59).\\nIt might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role.\\nYet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents.\\nNone the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces.\\nMittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019.\\nWhilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control.\\nSwann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed.\\nThis, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing.\\nBecause Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process.\\nIf Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led.\\nThe 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice.\\nAs Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193).\\nThe way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power.\\nThe Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019.\\n\\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children.\\nThis shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties.\\nNone the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988).\\nAn important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined.\\nOn the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process.\\nDespite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise.\\nParental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals.\\nParents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised.\\nMoreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment.\\nBy conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents.\\nWe can see how this occurred in our first two case studies.\\nIn both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed.\\nIn the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs.\\nWhereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment.\\nShe, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created.\\nUltimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs.\\nIn her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act.\\nHer direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs.\\nIn addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants.\\nBy securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice.\\nThus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThis article arises out of a research project on the \\u2018Identification of Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties: Participant

have a look at this \\nSo \\nthen, this\\nwe did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess \\nNo.\\naround and try and do any more.\\nNo, no.\\nThat's right.\\nCos we just got a real fright  when we couldn't stop the water pouring out.\\nOh.\\nIt's the little washer thing.\\nJust turn the tap.\\nWell I'll get

normally walk in or, or, or do you expect a ride?\\nWhat do you wanna go \\nYou \\non the bike ?\\nOh I see.\\nOh just as easy to erm\\nWhat go by car?\\ngo by car.\\nOh.\\nIt takes about  well \\nAbout two ticks, ya.\\nAlright.\\nFair enough.\\nI've still got  oh no, ticket's run out now.\\nWhat, four pound for one hour?\\nOh I'll just run in.\\nOkay.\\nRight now.\\nThe alternative is, do you wanna si this is where you  running here, you \\nDunno what I just done with the key actually.\\nTt!\\nBoy!\\nThat's bad.\\nNot to worry.\\nNot to worry.\\nErm  what we can do is er  use something here.\\nI bought this lot down with me.\\nIt might be in the other room actually.\\nNow so  the thing, and that goes in here, can use\\nOh!\\nWhat, is it a spanner?\\nIt's a sa kinda ratchet type thing.\\nOh.\\nJust that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough.\\nJust  thingie that\\nStill, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out?\\nNo, not let the water out, you let the air out.\\nWhen you bleed \\nOh I see.\\nit you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it.\\nOh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that\\nOh it's alright.\\nbut it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively.\\nI mean, obviously it's off now but erm\\nIs\\nAngie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer.\\nHello?\\nThat's got a  a key down there.\\nOh.\\nOh.\\nYeah I said we'd erm  drive over to Marion's on our way out and then  give her a

a bit different actually to the ones we had.\\nThey don't like, used to have a little  .\\nThat one's quite hot I think.\\nThat's erm  something or other.\\nOr just put it onto your  poppadom like that.\\nEasier to put it straight on.\\nMm.\\nSo we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff?\\nWell mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you \\nOh.\\nget it on one.\\nBecause she hasn't worked, nothing?\\nMm.\\nWell, so  and th , and the husband\\nSo married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered?\\nOr are they not?\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least.\\nIs, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing.\\nOh right.\\nBut  it's not so much nowadays though.\\nYou have a  the problem   if the husband remarries.\\nYeah.\\nEr, er, you know, who gets the\\nI suppose it's pretty difficult really.\\nNo you can't.\\nSorry.\\nErm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets \\nOh!\\na widow's pension from the bank \\nOh right.\\nso that she doesn't  so we get nothing for\\nOh right.\\nIt's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really?\\nOh  yeah.\\nAnd of course even that's going to change as time goes on.\\nReally?\\nSo what happens like, with me?\\nLike teaching?\\nDo I need to do  I, they don't do anything \\nWell you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact.\\nYeah.\\nCos obviously  it's different for you.\\nThat's the thing.\\nErm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something\\nMm.\\ner soon after you start your job.\\nYeah.\\nI'll think about it \\nSo, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty.\\nYeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one.\\nI'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four\\nMm.\\nwhen I qualify.\\nSeems sensible to start as soon as possible really.\\nWell you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy.\\nYeah.\\nThen take the twenty five or thirty years.\\nIs that what you've done?\\nThat's how you're paying?\\nNo.\\nThe two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on \\nOh right.\\nand when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine.\\nOh right.\\nThat's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one \\nOh right.\\nof you, for you.\\nYeah.\\nAnd the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid.\\nYeah.\\npaying tax on the interest.\\nOh right.\\nAnd then just utilize a little each year.\\nYeah.\\nOh right.\\nWe should get help with James though shouldn't we?\\nWell  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for \\nOh.\\nJames so, if there is something, all well and good.\\nOh yeah.\\nI don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks\\nMm.\\nyou're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock.\\nAnd you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or\\nWell the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked.\\nGone into erm  money .\\nAnd that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free.\\nYeah.\\nOh!\\nSo again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name.\\nOr grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's.\\nYeah.\\nThere's not that much there though is there?\\nThere's enough.\\nReally?\\nYeah, it's erm\\nDid you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn?\\nYes.\\nIt was very pleasant.\\nThe  the journey up there was erm \\nMum said , your mum's going a bit mental?\\nOh, probably is.\\nTo put it politely.\\nI expect she is.\\nDoes she see your brother much?\\nShe sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round.\\nReally?\\nMm.\\nOh good.\\nWell my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable\\nYeah.\\ner i in her place.\\nIt's been wonderful!\\nMum said it's really nice.\\nMm.\\nWhat is it?\\nIt's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for?\\nAlong , along th that sort of line.\\nErm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can \\nYeah.\\npull a cord  and they erm use a \\nIt's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to \\nOh that's true.\\ntidy it up.\\nAnd this is really what\\nSo is it, is it private or  or erm \\nWell it's her trust.\\nOh.\\nIt's her trust.\\nSo she pays?\\nShe pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm \\nSubsidised.\\nThat's right.\\nYeah.\\nThis is really what Ma-in-law should have done.\\nYeah.\\nAbout the same sort of thing.\\nOh yeah.\\nWell, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up.\\nSorry?\\nMum's fed up.\\nOh yeah.\\nShe was telling me the other day.\\nBut it's just \\nBut erm \\nI dunno, it's just so awful!\\nWell\\nIt just turned everything so sour.\\nMm.\\nBut it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her.\\nBut you, you just see to much of her that now\\nYeah.\\nthat it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or \\nMm!\\nor no , you know, anything.\\nWell no, you see\\nWell perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything.\\nI don't know.\\nBut the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off.\\nAnd, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward \\nNo.\\nthe children.\\nYeah.\\nAnd as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot!\\nYeah.\\nMm mm.\\nI was going mental!\\nWell that's it.\\nSo what did she say to you?\\nNothing.\\nWell,\\nI do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five\\nYeah.\\npeople in the house\\nIt's very stressful.\\nI'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there \\nYeah.\\nisn't a space there.\\nWell not if it's not designed for it.\\nI said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here.\\nMm.\\nAnd course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself.\\nWell there's nothing , yeah.\\nYou just can't do it.\\nBut if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us \\nMm mm.\\nbetween Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve \\nWell it's \\nand herself.\\nYes.\\nWhich is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William.\\nSure.\\nYou know, like more, more brother,si \\nYeah.\\nbrother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else.\\nBut, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off.\\nMum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff.\\nBut there is an underlined current there \\nMm.\\nwhich is erm, Mum is aware of.\\nOh definitely.\\nBut  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co \\nYeah.\\nand, and settle down in Brentwood.\\nI'm, I, I'm sorry.\\nIt's happened too many times now that she's \\nYou can \\nreally just, you can't break it.\\nYou can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her \\nYeah.\\nand will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her.\\nVery, very difficult.\\nWell  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead\\nYeah.\\nget on with it.\\nThere's no point ruining  a good relationship by \\nThat's right.\\nYeah.\\nthings like that.\\nJust turns everything sour.\\nSo how was your weekend \\nAh.\\nin  Sheffield?\\nDid you go wa , get around to see much at all?\\nErm, not much.\\nWhat did we do?\\nThe Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well.\\nYou'd gone up in, oh yes.\\nErm\\nDo you want a bit more?\\nNo, I've had, I've had erm  two already.\\nErm  we went out\\nGo on.\\nCan't remember.\\nCan't remember what I want now.\\nRight erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please?\\nchicken korma.\\nYep.\\nOkay.\\nAnd the king prawn korma.\\nAnd the king prawn korma.\\nDo you want another ?\\nNot for me thanks, no.\\nErm  what do you want the, the the  paratha \\nPi , pilau, yeah.\\nOne of those do you?\\nJust one of the  paratha \\nYeah, just one.\\nAnd, we wanted?\\nOne pilau and one mushroom\\nOne pilau and\\none mushroom\\nand one mushroom rice.\\nOne pilau rice and one mushroom.\\nAnd one mushroom rice.\\nYes thank you.\\nDo you want any nan bread?\\nDo you want any nan bread?\\nNo, I'm fine thank you.\\nNo, thanks a lot.\\nRight.\\nThank you.\\nOkay?\\nOne chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha \\nThat's it.\\nLovely.\\nThank you very much.\\nLovely , thank you.\\nYeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy.\\nIt was really good actually.\\nWe went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub.\\nIt was pouring down with rain though.\\nSo heavy!\\nWe got so soaked.\\nWe couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking.\\nYippee!\\nOh there is it?\\nOh!\\nWhat's happened now?\\nLooks a bit dead to me.\\n!\\nI had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers.\\nSo he smiled at me.\\nYeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice.\\nHe was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something.\\nBut he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so.\\nOh I see.\\nWhere was this, down Lincoln Avenue?\\nJus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham.\\nIt's the roads  you know where our house is?\\nJust \\nYeah.\\nthe road sort of, sort of here.\\nOh!\\nI see.\\nYeah.\\nThat's where it was.\\nOnly takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort \\nOh I see!\\nof stuff.\\nJust sort of up that way.\\nOh yes.\\nSo that's good \\nSo it's quite good \\nisn't it?\\nSo it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away.\\nSo it's easier to go to Witham.\\nYou have to change \\nMm.\\nat Twickenham though, that's not too \\nOh oh.\\nbad.\\nBut you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car.\\nOh.\\nThat's alright.\\nAnd as well, as Vicky's on that line as well .\\nVicky .\\nSo I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham.\\nOh yeah.\\nSo I must go and see her.\\nI was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day \\nYes, you must.\\nor something.\\nYeah!\\nWell you'll have to go down there.\\nAnd she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well.\\nAnd Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton.\\nSo we're all sort of in the same, very \\nYes, oh yes you must \\nclose vicinity \\nwell \\nso we're all gonna go out for dinner or something.\\nWe said \\nYeah.\\nwhen we're all settled in.\\nSo I must give her a ring this week actually.\\nI didn't realize how close we were.\\nI'm so, I've \\nNo.\\ngot no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue.\\nYou should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where \\nI know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map.\\nYeah.\\nCos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off.\\nWell then \\nYeah.\\nI haven't got a clue where I'm going.\\nNo.\\nAs for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue.\\nI never used one before  until I came here .\\nWell, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a \\nHonestly I \\ntrain for\\nI really haven't got a clue.\\na form of transport.\\nSo I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going.\\nYeah.\\nHaven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet?\\nYeah , but I'm hopeless !\\nMm mm.\\nI just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me.\\nI'm, they must think I'm so thick !\\nI just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus .\\nAnd that's the way it goes .\\nOh right.\\nBit of a hopeless case come to think of it.\\nMaybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are.\\nIt's just such a worry though.\\nWell no, no.\\nNo, no.\\nTake the, take the map with, stick it in your bag.\\nI just tell everyone I'm new in the area.\\nSo I just say I'm really new in the area .\\nSo my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area.\\nThe thing is do , I don't think I'd know.\\nI wouldn't know how to get a bus .\\nI wouldn't have a clue where to go.\\nOh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three \\nYeah.\\nyears  it's really matter of getting hold of a map \\nOh yeah.\\na a and using it.\\nI'm working my way  slowly but surely\\nYe you should \\nsh how to get around.\\nHow we doing for time?\\nMm.\\nNot bad.\\nIt's always busy.\\nIt's twenty five to ten.\\nHo oh!\\nMy God!\\nMm mm.\\nOh!\\nIt smells so nice.\\nWell  , okay.\\nYou'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better.\\nWhat's happening for James' birthday?\\nI don't know at the moment.\\nI haven't even thought about it.\\nAt least he doesn't want a party.\\nYou're safe \\nNo, oh \\nwith that one.\\nWell the thing is, er, I, I can\\nIt's quite nice how sensible he is in a way.\\nI, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family.\\nI think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there \\nYeah.\\ner er  he could become involved \\nYeah.\\nwith if he just let go\\nYeah.\\nCos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out\\nYes.\\ndrinking or whatever, and causing trouble.\\nThe thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up.\\nCos \\nMm.\\nI, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened.\\nYeah.\\nI'm sorry, but, you know, they're \\nI'm impressed with the warnings.\\nFor phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though.\\nYeah sure.\\nSure.\\nI think that's re , cos that's \\nHe \\nthe only way\\nYeah.\\ncos the majority \\nYes, you're right.\\nhaven't got a clue \\nYeah.\\nNo.\\nwhat anybody does.\\nYeah I know.\\nAh yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they \\nSilly.\\nare.\\nEven in somebody else's house you \\nYeah.\\njust show respect.\\nOh, yes.\\nI mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other \\nYeah.\\npeople's property or \\nAnd the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they?\\nMm.\\nI hope the master \\nI think the teachers are gonna have to be there.\\nWell, they'll be\\nI think they're gonna have a tough time.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nChicken  and prawn.\\nThank you.\\nkorma.\\nHave two more Cokes I should think.\\nYeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke?\\nYeah.\\nRight.\\nCan I have a  another two Diet Cokes please?\\nThank you.\\nI think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like.\\nI think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them.\\nWell,\\nWell they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave.\\nWell I ,.\\nI, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th \\nIt's no ignoring it\\nyeah, well the \\ntill it \\nthing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back \\nYeah.\\nto the U K. \\nBut it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble \\nMm.\\nwould stop.\\nI think you\\nCos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot.\\nNo, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house\\nYeah.\\nLovely thanks.\\nThanks.\\nAnother person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically.\\nYeah.\\nIt's sick!\\nYou can turn them off .\\nWell it's very jazzy in the surrounding.\\nOh yes.\\nI think I'll have those in the bedroom window.\\nDid you put my red light up yet?\\nI was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends .\\nAnd then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on?\\nYes.\\nThat's it.\\nCome on mate, I'm starving!\\nNo, no  advances on his, on his salary soon.\\nIt reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels?\\nLike und , that was underneath?\\nD'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant?\\nOh yes!\\nYes I do.\\nThanks very much.\\nYes that was a little bit out.\\nBut, ah yes, I remember.\\nYes.\\nYeah.\\nCor!\\nYou have a long memory.\\nCertainly have.\\nIt's there somewhere.\\nDo you remember it?\\nYes.\\nThat's erm, that's quite a while ago actually.\\nWell yes, a couple of years ago.\\nIt was when James went to  Russia.\\nOh!\\nThat was it.\\nEr near, near er  Skiptia \\nOh yeah, that's why he wasn't there.\\nnear  Skiptov \\nOh that was it.\\nRobert was in, at, at, University.\\nYeah.\\nOh that was it.\\nShe must have been away so we took flight.\\nYeah.\\nThat was good actually.\\nIt was quite nice.\\nExcept of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels.\\nMy goodness me!\\nWas a bit of a mare wasn't it?\\nAh!\\nIt was terrible.\\nBecause the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me.\\nYeah.\\nAnd secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that \\nYeah.\\nwell.\\nHas he got a job?\\nI do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank.\\nWell I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back \\nMm.\\non the damn thing again.\\nWell I can't even find the M twenty five !\\nNo.\\nI was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty \\nYeah.\\nfive on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight?\\nYes it is.\\nAfter that, we started in trouble.\\nWe went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray.\\nOh yeah?\\nBang!\\nWe were on the motorway\\nwhere's this bloody sign!\\n  \\n\\nSo, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was.\\nOh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway.\\nBut, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come\\nokay\\nYou have to lose your way, come back, yeah.\\nThat's it.\\nSo we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island.\\nOh!\\nOh !\\nOh alright.\\nFair enough.\\nSo we stopped again.\\nI went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left.\\nSo, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all.\\nMm.\\nI said, what the bloody hell's happening here?\\nSo went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then\\nYeah.\\nthere it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island.\\nBut  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great.\\nWell it would be, yeah.\\nAh!\\nReally great!\\nAnd we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er \\nI'm not surprised.\\nTerrible!\\nTerrible!\\nSo what is it, a, an actual island?\\nIt's an actual island, yes, and you see \\nAnd how bi , quite big, it must be quite big.\\nIs it big?\\nIt's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a \\nYou just take it over for the  weekend?\\nWell, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island \\nYeah.\\nthe  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath.\\nIt's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too \\nOh I see.\\nbecause of the water.\\nBut this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk.\\nOh.\\nOh blimey!\\nYeah th , the water level's just \\nReally?\\njust a, you know, way up above the  the main er\\nthing, yeah.\\nBut, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception  \\nOh I see.\\nOh quite pleasant.\\nMust cost them a fortune.\\nMm mm.\\nD'ya get everything paid for?\\nEverything paid for.\\nWell  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the\\nall yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all.\\nErm\\nDid they like your phone bill from erm\\nOh crikey!\\nThey won't be paying for that.\\nWhere was it?\\nOh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland.\\nThat's it.\\nI couldn't think where you'd been to .\\nOh.\\nNo,i , it should be that.\\nThe worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction \\nIt's not worth it  just for one week is it?\\nand then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some \\nWhy d'ya get up so early?\\nYou

breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television.\\nCos you can put the channel just to show the time  and \\nOh right.\\nand one or two others.\\nOh that's right.\\nErm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine.\\nOh!\\nI was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time.\\nAh oh.\\nYou know.\\nYou're not as dumb as you look are you?\\nNo , no.\\nWell the thing is,

over  books.\\nSure.\\nOh \\nSo \\ndon't worry about that.\\nThat'll be their books  upstairs.\\nAh but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it!\\nOh yeah.\\nWell that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there.\\nThere's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like\\nOh yes.\\nthis, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me\\nYeah sure.\\nlike if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt.\\nAnd it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room.\\nOh this isn't our room.\\nWe had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking.\\nOh dear!\\nSo embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed.\\nI saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ?\\nHe was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue.\\nEspecially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there.\\nYou know, like trying to stop it with our finger \\nYeah, sure, yeah.\\nand it was ju , it was burning our finger \\nYo , yes sure.\\nAnd squirting \\nAnd they \\nthe\\nyeah, they had like  like three towels.\\nIt's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on?\\nYeah, that's what fell out.\\nYeah.\\nI mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever.\\nUndid it too much, yeah sure.\\nYes you'd have to be \\nAnd then just it was, it was literally spurting out\\nYeah.\\nand it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's \\nNo, no, no.\\nbeen pumped through\\nPumping through, yeah.\\nAnd course it's got, pushing it \\nSo we still had all this boiling water \\nYeah.\\nand we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger.\\nAnd of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us.\\nMm mm.\\nSoaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere \\nOh God!\\nYeah.\\nAnd you got, in the end we just laughed.\\nAnd it, it came through to you?\\nIt came through yours?\\nYeah.\\nBecause, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized.\\nSo, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached\\nOh!\\nNo!\\nso she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward.\\nAngie went flying off, my pens went everywhere!\\nOh God!\\nAnd we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse.\\nWhat happened to your word processor?\\nIt was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd \\nOh I see.\\nAnd then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in.\\nAnd then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face!\\nOh no!\\nCut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to \\nOh!\\nlike try and mend that.\\nThen he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs.\\nOh God!\\nAnd then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent.\\nAnd, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing\\nYeah.\\ncos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark.\\nMella Mentha?\\nBombay Cassata?\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nI wanted a Lemon Delight.\\nYou Lemon Delight?\\nYeah.\\nMm.\\nSorry.\\nThanks.\\nDidn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight.\\nAnd erm \\nDelicious!\\nOh!\\nWanna take this stuff as a souvenir?\\nWell I'll take the umbrella, yeah.\\nOh.\\nGreat!\\nTuck in.\\nStart.\\nNo that's alright.\\nIt won't get cold.\\nSo of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold!\\nI've just heard what you said.\\nOh dear.\\nI'm on the ball tonight.\\nSomeone is slowing up.\\nIt's getting late.\\nSo, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down.\\nWe're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright?\\nAnd there was no answer.\\nSo we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down.\\nCourse we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark \\nOh God!\\nhaving a laugh on our behalf.\\nSo he came out and  we really slapped him hard !\\nWe thought that was \\nOh God!\\nreally out of order.\\nBut, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're \\nOh God!\\nin the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out.\\nAnd then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep.\\nAnd we're just like, oh God!\\nAnd then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere.\\nOh no!\\nOh dear.\\nAnd then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state.\\nHe'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on.\\nSo we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster .\\nAnd he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home.\\nHas he found a place now then or is he \\nYeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth.\\nWhich is quite a way out actually.\\nIt's \\nWhat's \\non the way to \\nand he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day?\\nYeah.\\nBloody hell!\\nYou alright?\\nYes.\\nYeah.\\nI'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight.\\nSo, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy.\\nOh I see.\\nHe seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well.\\nToo, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you?\\nOh eh?\\nOh he does it anyway.\\nI think he'll just crash at our house.\\nHe knows he's \\nYeah.\\nhe's more than welcome to crash at ours.\\nI mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something.\\nOr  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride.\\nOh yes.\\nOur cycle ride's just about long enough.\\nAnd he's, he, he he doesn't \\nIt's get \\ndrive?\\nthe worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like \\nYeah, sure.\\nYes.\\nthat is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even \\nMm.\\nlike the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit.\\nYeah.\\nCos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across.\\nOh I see.\\nWell yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it.\\nMm mm.\\nAnd everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college.\\nAnd that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever!\\nYeah.\\nLuckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die!\\nThere's quite a stretch though there.\\nYeah.\\nYou can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it?\\nJoining on the motorway bit.\\nMm.\\nMade it for me specially.\\nYeah.\\nQuite nice.\\nIs it?\\nIt's beautiful.\\nMm.\\nBombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now.\\nIt's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into \\nMm.\\ncollege so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car.\\nOh sure.\\nThe weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone.\\nI don't mind cycling.\\nWhat they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much.\\nOh, oh ah!\\nEverything's kept in ovens round here.\\nIn these little  Baby Belling type ones.\\nI wonder how much money they make?\\nThey do pretty well.\\nOh yes.\\nRight.\\nSorry about that.\\nThat's alright.\\nLovely, thanks very much.\\nOkay.\\nThank you.\\n, I got a brolly as well.\\nMm

pistachio actually.\\nNice actually.\\nIt's nice and light.\\nBeautiful!\\nSo what time do you expect your  friends home this evening?\\nDon't know.\\nIf they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something.\\nMm.\\nWell they're altogether so I suppose \\nMm.\\nin that way  they're relatively safe.\\nSo don't sit up worrying about them.\\nBut erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway!\\nOh yes.\\nCos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back.\\nBlimey!\\nPlus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night.\\nYeah.\\nBut apparently, it's meant to be really good there.\\nReally good erm  like Irish, sort of pub.\\nMm.\\nPub.\\nBut I would, I will go there sometime.\\nBut I  .\\nLovely.\\nMm.\\nIs yours alright?\\nVery nice.\\nWant a bit?\\nOh that's nice.\\nSomething cold and refreshing actually.\\nMm.\\nCos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in.\\nOh oh!\\nWill your transport be laid on or\\nI don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever\\nYeah.\\nthen erm  there \\nWhat's \\nmight be a coach.\\nIf not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school.\\nSo, you'll see.\\nSo I'll just see.\\nBut we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out.\\nCos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there.\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nIf I'm told to get the  whatever bus.\\nYeah.\\nCos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself .\\nMm.\\nWouldn't have a clue.\\nBut I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know.\\nHow often do you  that then?\\nWell  the train.\\nCos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth.\\nWhich is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think.\\nOh.\\nSo it's fine.\\nCos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired.\\nCos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off.\\nMm.\\nAnd then we do another four weeks.\\nOh.\\nI think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day\\nSure.\\nand maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever.\\nThe, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after \\nOh I see.\\nhalf term.\\nAnd what sort of age?\\nI'm with erm  nine and ten years olds.\\nMm.\\nYear five.\\nYeah.\\nI think so.\\nOh yeah.\\nI know, but I've never ever taught that age group before.\\nWell thump them one will you?\\nEvery time they get cocky, thump them!\\nYeah.\\nI've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds.\\nSo it'll be quite an experience.\\nMhm.\\nIt's gonna be so exhausting though.\\nYou get, we get assessed on it as well.\\nOh well.\\nYou fail those things and you're out basically.\\nIs there a, is there, is that a fact?\\nSo you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go.\\nAnd so \\nYeah.\\nBasically lesson pattern stuff.\\nCos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and \\nOh I see.\\nfit in with whatever, like their curriculum.\\nWell if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you?\\nCos I can always  sort of \\nYeah.\\nnip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then \\nYeah.\\nerm  bring it back to you.\\nYou know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening.\\nYeah.\\nOh cheers.\\nWell you're nearer than Robert was, yes.\\nYeah.\\nCos it's not too bad.\\nIt's really handy.\\nI , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all.\\nIt's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a \\nYeah.\\nrather heavy going.\\nWell it's so handy though.\\nIt's really like, like a big plus side to it.\\nMm.\\nI mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well.\\nJust so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour.\\nOh sure.\\nYeah.\\nOr people could be up within \\nYeah.\\nan hour to see me.\\nWell just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up.\\nMost people that I know have got cars.\\nYes.\\nLike Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up.\\nWell, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so\\nMm.\\nnow he was at Richmond.\\nAnd I phoned his house and he didn't phone back.\\nOh my God!\\nHe was down the pub.\\nBeast!\\nDear oh dear!\\nAnd he doesn't even drink!\\nHim and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er \\nOh yeah.\\nclay pigeon shooting.\\nIn , he loves it.\\nJust goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"  Independent, electronic edition of

of the Orient\\nBy ROGER BELL\\nIT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's.\\nThey are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian.\\nThe sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors.\\nHomely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm.\\nThe Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000.\\nBoth houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds.\\nThere are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands.\\nStone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more.\\nThere are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.\\nGlasgow: Clocks and scientific instruments, Wednesday 11am.\\nMarket Harborough: Ceramics, glass, toys, silver, musical instruments and artworks, Tuesday 10am.\\nPrints, watercolours, oil paintings, furniture and architectural effects, Tuesday 1.30pm.\\nGildings, Roman Way (0858 410414).\\nFinds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin\\nBy JOHN WINDSOR\\nCOMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload.\\nOnly a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia.\\nIt has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line.\\nAs the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business.\\nFor $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019.\\nThe London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel.\\nA new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company.\\nMost sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers.\\nNo vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training.\\nRowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny.\\nSuch in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does.\\nOne of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal.\\nAs honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust.\\nCompany archives are not that difficult to find.\\nThey tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers.\\nExpanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics.\\nI paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors.\\nThey include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938.\\nThere is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times.\\nBesides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake.\\nThe thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council.\\nShe has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to.\\nAs the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods.\\nShe relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators.\\nTwo years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers.\\nThe voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher.\\nWe accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up.\\nOne resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily.\\nShe will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume.\\nCollecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market\\nBy EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH\\nMany column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting.\\nVery little has been said about the boom in modern prints.\\nIn some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art.\\nPeter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market.\\n\\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money.\\nIt is more like actual currency.\\nThe reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique.\\nWhen other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be.\\nIt is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019\\nNot every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however.\\nThe blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names.\\nThere are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault.\\nThere are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis.\\nThere are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney.\\nWhat are the rules of admission to the pantheon?\\nFirst, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019.\\nSecond, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply.\\nThird, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field.\\nAll of these are fairly obvious.\\nBut there are two other, less obvious laws as well.\\nPrints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper.\\nEdvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality.\\nThe final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese.\\nThe Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations.\\nJapanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage.\\nThey do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans.\\nThey are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium.\\nJapanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing.\\nThe way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste.\\n\\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne.\\n\\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019\\nAs a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing.\\nThis makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions.\\nThe Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250.\\nBut now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro.\\nSomething they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz.\\nOccasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally.\\nAn example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts.\\nWhat they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality.\\nHow much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost?\\nThis is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again.\\nA recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high.\\nA big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000.\\nSpectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000.\\nSo do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan).\\nThe benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000.\\nMatisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness.\\nA beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more.\\nImages from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition.\\nThe established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney.\\nImages from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000.\\nIn recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform.\\nToday, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000.\\nObviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded.\\nBut what about the long-term future?\\nOne problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group.\\nThe Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis.\\nOne answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors.\\nYou can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000.\\nSignac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly.\\nA tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000.\\nEven Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing.\\nMove over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you.\\nIf this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

Boushel, Claire Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach worked in the London borough of Islington within social services for pre-school children.\\nThis chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered.\\nThe first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983.\\nThe next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy.\\nThe third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services.\\nThe fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority.\\nThe chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination.\\nBACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983\\nIslington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000.\\nIn 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis.\\nBetween 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority.\\nThe Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties.\\nUnlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free.\\nChildren were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand.\\nThe Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs.\\nBy 1983 it had half that number on roll.\\nSince 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities.\\nIn addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties.\\nSome integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation.\\nWorkers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup.\\nIn addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities.\\nIn 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2.\\nThe children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers.\\nResidential units\\nBy 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings.\\nFor example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care.\\nParents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home.\\nBy 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road.\\nThe Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties.\\nThe Community Health Team\\nThe Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision.\\nIt included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor.\\nThey were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school.\\nThis group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues.\\nDiscussion of services to individual children also took place.\\nThis included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options.\\nOften a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action.\\nThe Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential.\\nThey were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community.\\nThey gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children.\\nBecause of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision.\\nThe Special Services Team\\nIn the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children.\\nThese social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team.\\nThey all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered.\\nThey were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability.\\nWhen a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs.\\nThis might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage.\\nInstead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington.\\nFirst, the post was not attached to any specialist institution.\\nThere was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery.\\nSecond, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities.\\nThird, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs.\\nThere was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents.\\nATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY\\nThe Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort.\\nThis led to the initiation of an under-fives review.\\nThe review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership.\\nIt proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time.\\nDay care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents.\\nThe review had made no mention of children with special needs.\\nThe specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children.\\nThey interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders.\\nBroadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice.\\nParents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were.\\nMany commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer.\\nOne Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good.\\nShe fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended.\\nBecause the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead.\\nShe commented:\\nI had to fight every step of the way for this.\\nNo one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it.\\nI knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children.\\nIt doesn't matter that he's not like them.\\nI know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say.\\nParents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way.\\nSome parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs.\\nDefinitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English.\\nThis made the survey difficult to interpret.\\nThe findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome.\\nThese ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee.\\nThe conference: \\u2018A place for all our children'\\nAs a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision.\\nPrior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate.\\nThese included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers.\\nEach of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending.\\nAbout 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985.\\nWorkshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information.\\nThe conference made the following recommendations:\\n1\\nFor a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources.\\n2\\nFor children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised.\\n3\\nFor employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers.\\n4\\nFor availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations.\\n5\\nFor enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs.\\n6\\nFor priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision.\\n7\\nFor training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders.\\n8\\nFor greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision.\\n9\\nFor therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington.\\nIt was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented.\\nFinally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective.\\nThe Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference.\\nThe message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution.\\nUnfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy.\\nThe core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected.\\nAs a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague.\\nThe sub-committee\\nIn the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration.\\nThe group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups.\\nBattles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear.\\nMany community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration.\\nThey said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes.\\nThey also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time.\\nIf children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers.\\nTheir aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community!\\nInterestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019.\\nTHE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION\\nDespite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen!\\nThere were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive.\\nDay-care provision\\nSuccessful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual.\\nIt involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed.\\nEven when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes.\\nThis could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities.\\nPlaygroups\\nFollowing the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly.\\nTo some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs.\\nBecause of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working.\\nDespite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs.\\nTheir staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents.\\nSome children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years.\\nDay centres\\nSome individual placements were being made in children's day centres.\\nAlthough it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable.\\nAccess was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs.\\nThey had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available.\\nSome extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres.\\nSometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child.\\nIn some cases extra support has been unnecessary.\\nChild-minding\\nA few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place.\\nThis led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system.\\nThe specialist nursery\\nThe Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap.\\nThis could have provided opportunities for structural change and review.\\nThese never took place.\\nSenior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives.\\nWhat did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links.\\nThere was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children.\\nThe nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives.\\nA consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities.\\nAs a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result.\\nResidential provision\\nAs a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987.\\nThese included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults.\\nMost of these recommendations affected services for under fives.\\nRespite care\\nThe Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families.\\nAgain this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision.\\nFollowing the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned.\\nPriority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough.\\nAccess\\nAt the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access.\\nSince then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible.\\nOn completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments.\\nDisability awareness\\nA small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children.\\nThe course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care.\\nParents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course.\\nIt was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful.\\nStaff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided.\\nBARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM\\nFrom 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge.\\nReorganising social services\\nAfter 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy.\\nField, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated.\\nThe Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas.\\nThe way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration.\\nThree different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities!\\nEach Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload.\\nIt was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work.\\nThe issue of integration began to lose its visibility.\\nAttitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular.\\nThe cuts\\nAs a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years.\\nCuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed.\\nUnder-fives services were not identified as a priority.\\nInstead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss.\\nThe care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres.\\nIt is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise.\\nThe danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers.\\nThe abolition of the ILEA\\nLegislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London.\\nFor Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide.\\nIn particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools.\\nThe borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition.\\nThese included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives.\\nBefore the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways.\\nThe paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision.\\nThe document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail.\\nThe only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality.\\nThe author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019.\\nHe gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools.\\nHe also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism.\\nIt so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign.\\nFinally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration.\\nMost people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it.\\nIn such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided.\\nThe abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field.\\nThe under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department.\\nThis would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise.\\nIt contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989.\\nThe number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision.\\nNeither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities.\\nIt was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments.\\nDespite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education.\\nIn such a situation the future for integration looked bleak.\\nThe transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee.\\nThis committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education.\\nSuch a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group.\\nThe cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post.\\nWhen the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school.\\nOnce again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again.\\nShortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely.\\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\\nIn 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019.\\nThere was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help.\\nParents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs.\\nA coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop.\\nChildren with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years.\\nUntil the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity.\\nStaff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school.\\nThe local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2.\\nWithin social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units.\\nIt demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative.\\nPlacements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents.\\nToo often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process.\\nAt the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019.\\nSome days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn.\\nBecause council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place.\\nCost is not everything.\\nIt is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes.\\nIt is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services.\\nThe shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued.\\nCommunity play\\nVeronica Hanson\\nIn this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning.\\nThere is national funding for the scheme.\\nVeronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMembers of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible.\\nCounty \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group.\\nOnce a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided.\\nPlaygroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child.\\nPlaygroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader.\\nThe groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level.\\nFINDING THEIR WAY\\nChildren with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs.\\nTwo counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s.\\nIn 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol .\\nThis document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible.\\nThe Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families.\\nMembers of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group.\\nDevelopment of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers.\\nPPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start.\\nIf integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning.\\nEvery local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released.\\nPPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan.\\nThis involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again.\\nLIAISON\\nIn 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties.\\nBy 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county.\\nFunding for the schemes is varied.\\nEvery county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses.\\nEvery county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap.\\nUnderstandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding.\\nAlternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising.\\nTwo schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988.\\nEach PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator.\\nThe financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child.\\nPlacement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees.\\nA toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme.\\nThe referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups.\\nCoordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team.\\nEssential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared.\\nSTATEMENTS\\nThe playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour.\\nThe playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement.\\nShe will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere.\\nThe educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care.\\nPPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course.\\nTraining opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered.\\nShort \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration.\\nLIFE AFTER SCHOOL\\nAn international perspective on transition\\nJohn Fish\\nIn this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties.\\nHe discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom.\\nHe argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address.\\nA number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described.\\nFinally he considers the part education should play.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nTransition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade.\\nAt first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends.\\nThese show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment.\\nAs a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible.\\nA smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled.\\nIt presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups.\\nIn many instances expectations have been too low.\\nWhen decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited.\\nRecent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life.\\nFor more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled.\\nA number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988).\\nAlthough the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process.\\nThe work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process.\\nIt is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult.\\nThere is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed.\\nFinally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail.\\nIf the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential.\\nTHE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING\\nThe educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired.\\nIn addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive.\\nIt is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work.\\nHigher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989).\\nThis is a major reason for attention to transition.\\nBut, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7.\\nAlthough there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it.\\nIn a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18.\\nIn Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties.\\nTHE CHANGING CONTEXTS\\nThere is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom.\\nThose responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place.\\nThe Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution.\\nIt also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important.\\nSocial and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986.\\nThe parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies.\\nSections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present.\\nThe Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned.\\nThis will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan.\\n\\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions.\\nThe movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential.\\nChanges are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities.\\nFinally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils.\\nThese will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it.\\nEducation can only contribute one element to successful transition.\\nTo be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends.\\nCOORDINATION AND CONTINUITY\\nAlthough an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important.\\nFor a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial.\\nTransition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation.\\nDuring the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children.\\nAfter that period there are many independent contributors.\\nThe secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies.\\nThis confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients.\\nFor example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability.\\nSome definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others.\\nAfter school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions.\\nThere are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients.\\nThis is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served.\\nThis may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies.\\nWith so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process.\\nIndeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable.\\nEven if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition.\\nThe OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed:\\nEmployment, useful work and valued activity.\\nPersonal autonomy, independent living and adult status.\\nSocial interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation.\\nAdult roles within the family including marriage.\\nProgress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration.\\nTo pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective.\\nContinuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition.\\nOECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital.\\nMAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION\\nA number of issues are common to national and international contexts.\\nThey provide a useful agenda for discussion:\\nThe starting point\\nConsideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education.\\nThe place of education is also important.\\nAttendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped.\\nThe importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning.\\nInter-agency planning and collaboration\\nThe United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration.\\nResponsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities.\\nEmpowerment\\nTo fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations.\\nEffective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities.\\nSimilarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress.\\nProfessional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment.\\nTransitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life.\\nBut the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage.\\nProfessionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment.\\nAmbivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment.\\nWork with parents\\nLittle professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period.\\nParents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress.\\nAs work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood.\\nSupporting arrangements are rarely readily available.\\nThe importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated.\\nAssessment\\nTransitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual.\\nAssessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need.\\nIt is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations.\\nToo often decisions are:\\n1\\nbased on past performance;\\n2\\nconfined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and\\n3\\nseldom based on experience and training in real situations.\\nNew legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment.\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services.\\nContinuity of support\\nIn the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available.\\nThe development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries.\\nThere is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition.\\nProfessional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated.\\nIt is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity.\\nSuch services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice.\\nINNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES\\nThere are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom.\\nThose reported here are from other countries.\\nThis is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition.\\nThe final years of school\\nThe work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al .\\n1989, Wehman et al .\\n1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school.\\nThe Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al .\\n1989) gives details of school programmes.\\nStudents with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA.\\nThus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States.\\nSailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches.\\nThis starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations.\\nExperiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria.\\nVocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills.\\nAn individual transition plan\\nThe Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States.\\nAn Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this.\\nThe purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families.\\nThe features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor.\\nA guide or point of reference\\nBecause of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families.\\nIn a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b).\\nOne which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark.\\nA Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school.\\nThe Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience.\\nHe or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school.\\nThe time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another.\\nSupport can be offered for up to four years after school.\\nThe Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families.\\nSupported employment\\nOne of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities.\\nResearch in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited.\\nSupported open employment is much more successful.\\nThe Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States.\\nThe importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations.\\nYoung people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams.\\nSalary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility.\\nSupport teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems.\\nResults are impressive.\\nIn a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment.\\nTHE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION\\nIt is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition.\\nThey also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education.\\nMany of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative.\\nThe labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school.\\nTo increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available.\\nThe possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge.\\nUnless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult.\\nVouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive.\\nA recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital.\\nParents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees.\\nThis means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula.\\nBut, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person.\\nThe development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education.\\nSupporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice.\\nDevelopments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit.\\nIts publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nPost-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for.\\nIn the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre.\\nNow the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy.\\nFor the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community.\\nWhat is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access.\\nHowever, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment.\\nResearch in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future.\\nOnly by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need.\\nThus, the charity image of disability must disappear.\\nHigher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity.\\nThe form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review.\\nThe rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life\\nJenny Corbett and Len Barton\\nIn this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties.\\nThey argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition.\\nThey discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training.\\nThey describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThis chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life.\\nIt is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977).\\nIntegration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries.\\n\\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living.\\nThe extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019.\\nThis broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area.\\nIt also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted.\\nWe are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making.\\nCONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION'\\nA failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue.\\nIf integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged.\\nGiven the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs.\\nThe question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one.\\nGovernment documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language.\\nThe Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a\\nwidely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people.\\n(DES 1978: 99)\\nand the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that:\\nThe integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible.\\n(Council of Europe 1986: 9)\\njust as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019.\\nAdulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019.\\n\\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated?\\nAs it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives.\\nAbberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference.\\nHe claims, moreover, that such a view is\\nnot only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people.\\n(Abberley 1989: 56)\\nThe argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency.\\nOpportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic.\\nBarnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies.\\nThis research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision.\\nWhere young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to.\\nStaff encouraged debate but these users\\n appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026\\nThe more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate.\\n(Barnes 1990: 136)\\nIt is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult.\\n\\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel.\\nHowever, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular.\\nGriffiths argues that\\nAdulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone.\\nInstead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years.\\n(Griffiths 1989: 5)\\nThere is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups.\\nfor those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019.\\nFor an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy.\\nRecent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990).\\nThe majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances.\\nHostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990).\\nThis form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual.\\nWallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past.\\nTRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION\\nThe whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic.\\nThe period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status.\\nYet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum.\\nThe curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles.\\nBy contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study.\\nIn the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible.\\nThus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship.\\nThe language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people.\\nYet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them:\\nJealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down.\\n\\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves.\\nAlternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs.\\nIt is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course.\\n(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9)\\nThe authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements.\\nThey even suggest that\\nSuch problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course.\\nIt is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations.\\n(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72)\\nIf this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage:\\nIndeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities.\\nNaturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable.\\nIf nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made.\\n(Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72)\\nWithin this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation.\\nA common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education.\\nDespite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes.\\nSocial and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status.\\nAlthough notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989).\\nSuch \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges.\\nA move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process.\\nHowever, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation.\\nfay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27).\\nFay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27).\\nAn invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26).\\nTRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING\\nAnother aspect of transition is that from school to youth training.\\nThis offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts.\\nThese programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability.\\nHollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes:\\nSome young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs.\\nAs such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum.\\n(Hollands 1990: 73)\\nIn supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990).\\nAs this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise:\\nso that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in.\\n(Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97)\\nThis \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice.\\n\\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process:\\nPerhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it.\\n(Gleeson 1990: 188)\\nYouth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority:\\nGeorge, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019\\nOthers spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019.\\nIt was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic.\\n(Lee et al .\\n1990: 133)\\nWithin this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991).\\nIn exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that.\\nYoung people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment.\\nThe work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation.\\n(Bates 1991: 1)\\nFor some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990).\\nTransition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices.\\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\\nTransition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities.\\nfor some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989).\\nTheir \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991).\\nThe reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989).\\nIf they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience.\\nNewman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme.\\nHe was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme.\\nAs it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post.\\nWithout initial support, this transition would have been impractical.\\nClass, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads.\\nThe level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent.\\nThe rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period.\\nMuch of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world.\\nIt is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood.\\nSupporting special needs in further education\\nMaureen Turnham\\nSince 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college.\\nIn this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college.\\nShe questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes.\\nShe reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners.\\nIMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION\\nMy mother saw it.\\nMy colleague saw it and cut it out for me.\\nI didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children.\\nLecturer!\\nI remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university.\\nMy quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college.\\nMy initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump.\\nUpon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019.\\nSeveral of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch.\\nThey had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough.\\nIt was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019.\\nSome of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families.\\nThey all knew my younger sister, for example.\\nShe went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left.\\nSome first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators?\\nMy knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant.\\nI was thrown into a jungle of new jargon.\\nThe language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students.\\nCollege induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019.\\nAfter all, I had nine years' experience in special education.\\nSurely, further education could not be so different?\\nTHE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION\\nSeven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed.\\nOur college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes.\\nThe lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019.\\nFor a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them.\\nTalking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school.\\nStories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate.\\nThe life preparation course\\nIn 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties.\\nThis provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres.\\nFor many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education.\\nA former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe.\\nIt began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!).\\nThe building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator.\\nOpportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning.\\nFor instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines.\\nThe annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors.\\nDuring queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue.\\nI have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else.\\nThe mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part.\\nWhile I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings.\\nSomething as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term.\\nHowever, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties.\\nHow nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely.\\nJoint craft\\nConscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area.\\nIt was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week.\\nThe nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration.\\nIt was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects.\\nThe projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion.\\nAlthough this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs.\\nOne unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships.\\nThe increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit.\\nFlushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students.\\nThe results were disappointing.\\nWith hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor.\\nThey felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nThe outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups.\\nDuring a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students.\\nThey felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nI would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally.\\nIt seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought.\\nThere could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment.\\nWe now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course.\\nFeeling established\\nOur life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses.\\nThis was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities.\\nA pat on the back!\\nIt felt like confirmation that we had got it right.\\nThis seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit.\\nOther colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties.\\nThis  group had met almost every week for nearly two years.\\nThe national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988).\\nCurriculum principles\\nFrom the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019.\\nEvery opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized.\\nFor instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students.\\nThe possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners.\\nThe college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons.\\nOne example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff.\\nStudents have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union.\\nThey are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites.\\nTravelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre.\\nSupervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants.\\nIn general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties.\\nHowever, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019.\\nThe whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites.\\nWe share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff.\\nAn early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019.\\nWe talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!).\\nThis mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building.\\nWith hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students.\\nOne route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf.\\nSelf-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote.\\nThe Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989).\\nSelection procedures\\nAt present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time.\\nWe didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course.\\nI suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students.\\nAlso, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities.\\nI can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019.\\nWhen she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019.\\nThis represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me.\\nI was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision.\\nI thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties.\\nHowever, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me.\\nOur selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour.\\nOur selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable.\\nNational reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11).\\nIn considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour.\\nThe life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would.\\nThe possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners.\\nIt is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with?\\nCOUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION\\nThere are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019.\\nHowever, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change.\\nIt is a lengthy and wearing process.\\nAttempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality.\\nI believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019.\\nI believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice.\\nOur college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document.\\nI am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee.\\nWhen the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last!\\nUnfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document.\\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago.\\nI failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down.\\nOnce again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019.\\nSenior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system.\\nNegative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did.\\nI have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am.\\nI no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students.\\nAlternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026\\nI/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different.\\nIt's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019.\\nApart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing.\\nI refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019.\\nStudents with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task.\\nAs a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate.\\nWithin a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense.\\nWe do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible.\\nQuestions of physical access\\nThe physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances.\\nAt the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped.\\nIn the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes.\\nPhysical barriers to integration often receive much publicity.\\nHowever, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail.\\nThe ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency!\\nI discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards.\\nA subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left.\\nAny \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted.\\nRegrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019.\\nShort-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock.\\nTHE FUTURE\\nThere are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning.\\nThere are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community.\\nThe need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019.\\nVery recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019.\\nThey did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs.\\nThey are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person.\\nThe current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students.\\nMy earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity.\\nI obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability.\\nHowever, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings.\\nMany changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners.\\nThese are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health.\\nIn a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely.\\nPutting theory into practice is far from simple.\\nNevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone.\\nA hard journey in the right direction\\nExperiencing life beyond an institution\\nLinda Shaw\\nIn this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend.\\nHer knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view.\\nElizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019.\\nLinda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life.\\nDespite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nElizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution.\\nThe move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties.\\nI was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate.\\nI have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers.\\nThe women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy.\\nSTARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE\\nMore than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities.\\nThe women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people.\\nTheir daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility.\\nAs well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend.\\nHealth service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service.\\nNeighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful.\\nThe women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved.\\nThe realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home.\\nThe first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible.\\nOne member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds.\\nThe balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted.\\nStaff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers.\\nFrom the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own.\\nShe coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities.\\n\\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself.\\nHelen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding.\\nElizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult.\\nOn many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative.\\nAt the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom.\\nShe cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached.\\nShe was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019\\nprofessional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters.\\nIn those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress.\\nThe basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019.\\nWIDENING HORIZONS\\nLooking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned.\\nAs the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines.\\nThe women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry.\\nThey have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over.\\nAlthough lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody.\\nA typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music.\\nHelen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing.\\nSome form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme.\\nSuch social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis.\\nAround the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy.\\nThey had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church.\\nA trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by.\\nElizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home.\\nBecause of Helen.\\nGoing out.\\nLikes seeing Linda.\\nLikes the workers.\\nBecause of my car.\\nGoing to church.\\nHaving visitors.\\nHaving a fish tank.\\nElizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment.\\nShe says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden.\\nShe does not want to do housework.\\nHelen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday.\\nHer speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away.\\nShe'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions.\\nShe is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations.\\nShe often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary.\\nHelen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff.\\nHelen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant.\\nIn general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically.\\nElizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly.\\nFor a start she looks different.\\nShe is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age.\\nShe slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner.\\nShe says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks.\\nShe can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor.\\nShe is exceptionally good company when she is happy.\\nShe is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties.\\nShe works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019.\\nShe expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection.\\nHow to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers.\\nElizabeth is learning to speak up for herself.\\nShe says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time.\\nI received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019\\nShe is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community.\\nAt times it surely is very difficult for her.\\nShe still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing.\\nA SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK\\nCommunity care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency.\\nElizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net.\\nIt is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve.\\nThe women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight.\\nBehind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems.\\nDuring the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency.\\nNone of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat.\\nI left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction.\\nI was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions.\\nI reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends.\\nThe period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat.\\nAt one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis.\\nThe consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages.\\nMembers of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women.\\nIt is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home.\\nThe effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services.\\nThe IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress.\\nIt is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service.\\nThe system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress.\\nThe written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan.\\nThe Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval.\\nSupport staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity.\\nThey are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities.\\nThe lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down.\\nWhile the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression.\\nHelen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level.\\nAccording to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019.\\nSupport workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties.\\n\\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker.\\n\\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019\\nA senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019.\\nWhen new staff were appointed development could move ahead again.\\nRegarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019\\nElizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life.\\n\\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say.\\n\\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019.\\nThey have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community.\\nAnd while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care.\\nCONCLUSION\\nElizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties.\\nThere has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved.\\nThe new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life.\\nOpportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital.\\nFrom the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community.\\nTHE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES\\nFools and heretics\\nParents' views of professionals\\nChris Goodey\\nIn this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators.\\nHe argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being.\\nIt is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents.\\nHe supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them.\\nHe concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all.\\nA HUMAN FAILING\\nWhat is it to be human?\\nThe segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately.\\nProfessionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide.\\nWe as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group.\\nWe do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do.\\nWe do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019.\\nWe do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species).\\nAlongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me.\\nIn our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put.\\nExpert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective.\\nBut in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described.\\nWe have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not.\\nWe then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists.\\nThe appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards.\\nIt gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary.\\nIf it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all.\\nPhilosophies clash and compete.\\nAs far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019.\\nThe excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one.\\nThis necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise.\\nHistory has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy.\\nThe Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one.\\nIn our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion.\\nNatural experts?\\nThe includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group.\\n\\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one.\\nI put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood.\\nThere is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one.\\nBut if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts.\\nAs one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019\\nConversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species.\\nMost parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species.\\nThis observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance.\\nFor parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is.\\nIt is a way of life.\\nDeny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence.\\nThey will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019.\\nIn the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities.\\nIt is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability.\\nBecause it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form.\\nTo borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them.\\nThey contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day.\\nIn short, they are a colonised people.\\nBut in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them.\\nThe stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019,\\n\\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species.\\nThey believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019\\nWORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT\\nMy opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research.\\nBetween 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7.\\nI had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991).\\nBefore I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families.\\nSecond, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature.\\nAfter beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike.\\nA shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes.\\nIt may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another.\\nBut we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience.\\nIt became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words.\\nParents as truth tellers\\nEven in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth.\\nI may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal.\\nI decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream.\\nIf they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia.\\nIf they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned.\\nTo accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nIn what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement.\\nSHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION\\n\\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28).\\nBernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026\\nI had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that.\\nI thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome.\\nMentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would.\\nEvery one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences.\\nFor Bernadette, it's amusing.\\nFrom this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent.\\nPat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019\\nAnd I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019\\nAnd he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it.\\nHe wasn't looking at me.\\nHe was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway.\\nI mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs].\\nAnd I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing.\\nAnd then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over.\\nPat has reasons not to mind.\\nThe baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth.\\nIn addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities.\\nBoth she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue.\\nWhat about those who haven't?\\nRita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019\\nAnd then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019\\nI said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019\\nShe said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019\\nI said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026\\nSo I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward.\\nNone of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026\\nYeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her.\\nAs soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026\\nThe exact feelings\\u2026\\nI wanted her to die\\u2026\\nAnd I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her.\\nNow this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one.\\n\\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked?\\nIn the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women).\\nRita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances.\\nThe baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days.\\nSince Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in.\\nEventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019\\nShe is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures.\\nMost importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere:\\nRita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026\\nI don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed.\\nI was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol.\\nIf we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them.\\nI'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026\\nThey're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way.\\nThey're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be?\\nThey're just there , you know.\\nLike many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes.\\nSuch parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019).\\nBetween the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances.\\nSome parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing.\\nSome may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died.\\nFor others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc.\\nAnd none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment.\\n\\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking.\\nThis self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on.\\nWhat needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification.\\nBrian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems.\\n\\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS?\\nFor many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead.\\nMany doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026\\nThese feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome.\\n(Cunningham 1982: 31, 39)\\nA couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed.\\nShe tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother.\\nSharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal.\\nAntenatal classes should talk about it.\\nAlthough I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby?\\nAnd he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us.\\nBut you've got to think about it if it does happen to you.\\nI mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it.\\nThere's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens.\\nDave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told.\\nIf you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026\\nLooking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean?\\nBecause it is another world.\\nBecause what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening.\\nFor both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite.\\nMany parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion.\\nPhil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026\\nThey put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything.\\nI grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now?\\nAnd they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see.\\nI said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home.\\nStart life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019\\nThat afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026\\nI mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons].\\nAnd after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place.\\nJust as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019.\\nHelen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it.\\nSo that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him.\\nThe majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified).\\nCunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,.\\nIt is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with.\\nPerhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability.\\nFor the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy.\\nFor the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it.\\nThis widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies.\\nIn medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion.\\nYet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive.\\nSome who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital.\\nOthers had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating.\\nEven where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping.\\nJeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them.\\nI'm not sure, though.\\nI'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again.\\nSimilarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour.\\nNo doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged.\\nIn this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue.\\nPat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they?\\nI mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal.\\nBut why do that?\\nI mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society?\\nI mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all?\\nIf we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it?\\nThe world of normality is redefined.\\nNo longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience.\\nLUCKY LEPERS\\n\\u2018I am fortunate.\\nI do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16).\\nKathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us.\\nI think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like.\\nI didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me.\\nI didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could.\\nI'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again.\\nBefore I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose.\\nBut I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like.\\nYou've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like.\\nBeverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026\\nHe's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019\\nI wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026\\nMy priorities in my mind's eye is better.\\nTheir priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning.\\nMy priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now.\\nGod forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car.\\nIt stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know.\\nMaybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026\\nPhil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026\\nPerhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people.\\nI mean I know what it's like to be Black.\\nI feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026\\nI mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there.\\nBravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts.\\nIf they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like.\\nLAST WORDS\\nI have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature.\\nApart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too.\\nIt does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents.\\nI have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life.\\nLet us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry.\\nIn a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents.\\nFollowing a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019.\\nAnyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7).\\nLet us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham.\\nEarlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues.\\nWhy am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts?\\nI am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog.\\nThere are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019.\\nThere is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people.\\nThe beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019.\\nThey may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras.\\nIn our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such.\\nThe best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation.\\nRuled out or rescued?\\nA Statement for Balbinder\\nElizabeth Grugeon\\nElizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family.\\nShe was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand.\\nBalbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019.\\nMY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY\\nA long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh.\\nHe was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist.\\nThe head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language.\\nThey were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019.\\nHis transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them.\\nThis chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective.\\nI had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme.\\nBalbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me.\\nOver the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family.\\nBy the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school.\\nMr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence.\\nMr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue.\\nHowever, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this.\\nThey were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture.\\nThe two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages.\\nBalbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English.\\nAs both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising.\\nI reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement.\\nIn fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy.\\nMrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it.\\nShe continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English.\\nI wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family.\\nHowever, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped.\\nThere were complaints about his behaviour.\\nHe did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children.\\nAt home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house.\\nIn the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined.\\nBut the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder.\\nThe staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language.\\nHis mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him.\\nMrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress.\\nShe wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English.\\nShe and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read.\\nHe had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read.\\nWhenever they visited me I listened to him reading.\\nHe was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension.\\nI felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary.\\nI remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals.\\nHe could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape.\\nAt 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader.\\nThe idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him.\\nBalbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden.\\nMrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate.\\nI was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life.\\nThe list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019.\\nThe Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge.\\nAlmost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible.\\nLetters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them.\\nSchools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents.\\nEnd of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019.\\nHowever phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her.\\nShe interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one.\\nOn one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers.\\nThe teacher was brusque and busy.\\nShe brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that.\\nYou can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019\\nMrs Singh was not satisfied.\\nShe wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book.\\nHis teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read.\\nHe produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently.\\nThe teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's.\\nLooking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that.\\nThe teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019.\\nShe continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019.\\nNone of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019\\nLater, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was.\\nLooking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019\\nThe school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school.\\nThere had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's.\\nMrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions.\\nIn the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate.\\nThe psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money.\\nBoth ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh.\\nThere were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money.\\nNeither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue.\\nMrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role.\\nTHE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER\\nMy contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh.\\nThe head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress.\\nThe class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019.\\nTheir concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind.\\nThe head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs.\\nStandardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019.\\nAs a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder.\\nThey now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say.\\nThe same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears.\\nI realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school.\\nAs an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role.\\nI kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education.\\nMarch 3: The initial meeting\\nMeeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school.\\nThe head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed.\\nHe explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better.\\nHe stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up.\\nHe seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer.\\nThis was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process.\\nBoth the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs.\\nBy suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself.\\nShe became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault.\\nShe cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019\\nWhen she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed.\\nShe felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough.\\nShe listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure.\\nThey stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband.\\nThe first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again.\\nA date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them.\\nWhat I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away.\\nAfter she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail.\\nIn the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late.\\nIn Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner.\\nThere were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer.\\nHe was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly.\\nAs he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019\\nThey had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents.\\nYet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned.\\nIt was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county.\\nAs the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him.\\nThus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible.\\nLater on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home.\\nOver tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion.\\nMrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years.\\nShe was depressed and angry with Balbinder.\\nShe had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day.\\nShe clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested.\\nHowever we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time.\\nThe difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning.\\nOne from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school.\\nFortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school.\\nI suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening.\\nMrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise.\\nAnother letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip.\\nWe discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope.\\nTo his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday.\\nAt nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested.\\nIn the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher.\\nHer school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem.\\nIn her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year.\\nShe also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back.\\nAt this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed.\\nIf the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment.\\nOn the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day.\\nThe school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers.\\nThe middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents.\\nIf Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school.\\nOn the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist.\\nIf Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress.\\nMarch 9: Visiting Cedars School\\nThe head made us very welcome.\\nHe began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school.\\nHe stressed the normality of the children who attended it.\\nHe explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed.\\nHe explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning.\\nCedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training.\\nAll of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties.\\nAnother special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter.\\nBalbinder would be in a group with ten children.\\nMrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head.\\nI am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar.\\nAfter a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019\\nThe head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively.\\nThere is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress.\\nAll parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019\\nThey review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week.\\nAt the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September.\\nAt this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019\\nThe head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem.\\nHe told them that many children learned more slowly.\\nHe illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way.\\nHe explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears.\\nMr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology.\\nHe went on to tell them about the school.\\nThe children started at 5 and could stay until 16.\\nThey could also leave at any time.\\nEach part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group.\\nAt 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work.\\nSeveral of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment.\\nHe then took us round the school.\\nThe lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment.\\nThe rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant.\\nIt was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment.\\nI was particularly impressed by the art room.\\nThe workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers.\\nOutside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park.\\nPart of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop.\\nThere was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field.\\nThere seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group.\\nAfter the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement.\\nHe explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019\\nThe school had an open-door policy.\\nHe then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school.\\nHe explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask).\\nHe explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place.\\nThe educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder.\\nHe himself would visit Balbinder at his present school.\\nHe stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right.\\nNothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019\\nThen Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall.\\nAgain, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019\\nMr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019\\nThe head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help.\\nHowever they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019.\\nMrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder.\\nShe seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019\\nThe head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more.\\nInstead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school.\\nHe told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children.\\nMrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019\\nThe head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019.\\n\\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively.\\nThe head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019.\\nIts job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019.\\nHe gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out.\\nWe rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days.\\nBoth Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school.\\nMr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped.\\nThis had clearly been worrying them both.\\nWhen we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move.\\nIt was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences.\\nIt all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands.\\nDespite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged.\\nLooking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it.\\nThey would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019\\nTerms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them.\\nThe school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019\\nNeither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role.\\nMarch 12: Coping with the procedure\\nI met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room.\\nMrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars.\\nI tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents.\\nThe educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex.\\nHe told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits.\\nThere would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action.\\nThe sheer amount of information seemed daunting.\\nI arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh.\\nWhen I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure:\\nThe learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation.\\nTherefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement.\\nThe letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019\\nAn enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process.\\nIn this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019\\nSince they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them.\\nGoing through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019\\nAll these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier.\\nAs they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream.\\nI did not feel so optimistic.\\nThe brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019.\\nJune 5: Testing\\nVisited Mrs Singh at home.\\nShe told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist.\\nBalbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles.\\nThe psychologist had said he was good with his hands.\\nMrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about.\\nShe said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019.\\nI was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019.\\nShe went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school.\\nShe was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden.\\nHer husband was away in India for three weeks.\\nPeople were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door.\\nWe spent a lot of time discussing this.\\nIn some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time.\\nPerhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands.\\nWe agreed to meet at school the following week.\\nJune 10: The information for the Statement\\nFirst, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc.\\nThere was a brief account of professional intervention to date.\\nBefore starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist.\\nThen, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class.\\nHe had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good.\\nHe had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read.\\nThe head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this.\\nI think Mrs Singh understood.\\nBalbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds.\\nHis progress was slow because his retention was poor.\\nAt this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019\\nThe head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019\\nMrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things.\\nThe head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi.\\nThere were discrepancies in the report.\\nOn the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art!\\nHaving said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher).\\nThe head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three.\\nIn order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts.\\nIn his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time.\\nThe head then commented on his social development.\\nHere they felt there had been much progress.\\nBalbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child.\\nThe head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education.\\nSince Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer.\\nThe head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him.\\nAlso he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly.\\nFurther he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus.\\nThey had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars.\\nThe head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind.\\nAs he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities.\\nAnd he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019\\nThe educational psychologist gave his report.\\nHe reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school.\\nHe stressed that he was a very likeable little boy.\\nHowever, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour.\\nHe ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult.\\nDespite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work.\\nHe was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group.\\nOften he watched other children and then followed and copied them.\\nThe psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing.\\nHe clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help.\\nWhen asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019.\\nOn the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding.\\nHe felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences.\\nAt this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019\\nShe felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi.\\nShe referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home.\\nShe found this very odd.\\nAt the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019.\\nThe educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups.\\nMrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him.\\nThe educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments.\\nIt seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them.\\nHe still had to have a medical.\\nThe head would speak to the school doctor that same day.\\nSocial Services would write to Mrs Singh.\\nThe procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term.\\nMrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to.\\nThe educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled.\\nThe head said he would chase up the documents.\\nMrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given.\\nI promised to go and see her again on Friday morning.\\nThroughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute.\\nHer anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made.\\nIt seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required.\\nJune 12\\nI visited Mr and Mrs Singh.\\nMrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point.\\nHe agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal.\\nHe listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place.\\nI said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow.\\nMrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor.\\nThey both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019.\\nWhat particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi.\\nMrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English.\\nBoth parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars.\\nJune 22: Acceptance\\nMrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars.\\nThey had understood the gist but needed help.\\nWe filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit.\\nThe school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term.\\nBalbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet.\\nJuly 15: Balbinder visits his new school\\nMrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School.\\nBalbinder was very subdued.\\nHis mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was.\\nHe had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December.\\nHe did not speak all the way.\\nMrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed.\\nWe were early and stood in the playground.\\nBalbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh.\\nWe went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events.\\nWe were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in.\\nThe head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing.\\nEach year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done.\\nThe classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children.\\nThere were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group.\\nMrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented.\\nIt was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do.\\nThe children were then asked to go out to play.\\nBalbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother.\\nHe had lost interest in the activities.\\nThere had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly.\\nIt looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently.\\nThe head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt.\\nWe were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in.\\nMrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school.\\nClasses were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant.\\nIt was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground.\\nBalbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it.\\nIn the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles.\\nIn the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables.\\nIt was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment.\\nThis filled Mrs Singh with horror.\\nShe was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read.\\nMrs Allinson was very reassuring.\\nHowever, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase.\\nEarlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019\\nOn the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more.\\nIn the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out.\\nIt was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on.\\nNo one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it.\\nIn all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure.\\nDecisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him.\\nOver the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self.\\nAt Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder.\\nShe and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English.\\nHowever, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw.\\nI wondered whether she had any misgivings.\\nThe distance will certainly be a  problem.\\nWhat she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine.\\nChoice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed.\\nPROGRESS REPORT\\nIn September Balbinder started at Cedars.\\nMy contact with the family became much less frequent.\\nTheir circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself.\\nThe job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them.\\nThe coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home.\\nBalbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day.\\nFor the first few weeks of term this was a problem.\\nMr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts.\\nHis brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not.\\nThe whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety.\\nBy half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening.\\nMrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships.\\nShe occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar.\\nThis showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about.\\nShe and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class.\\nShe had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything.\\nFrom January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys.\\nMy advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them.\\nBalbinder was no longer a worry.\\nHowever, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening.\\nShe wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress.\\nI was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own.\\nThe section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries.\\nHe had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him.\\nHis class teacher also felt that he was making progress.\\nBoth parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them.\\nThey had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements.\\nLooking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked.\\nHe had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on.\\nShe had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019.\\nIt seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing.\\nHis present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school.\\nThis was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group.\\nIn this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil.\\nHowever, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old.\\nHe could not read or write independently.\\nHis written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied.\\nThe question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered.\\nLater, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring.\\nHowever, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language.\\nShe reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,.\\nOut of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem.\\nHis re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly.\\nThe process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development.\\nIt has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school.\\nIn a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019.\\nHer lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019\\nBalbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for.\\nOn being a client\\nConflicting perspectives on assessment\\nDerrick Armstrong and David Galloway\\nThis chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act.\\nThe analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties.\\nIn each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants.\\nINTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER\\nPerhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients.\\nLikewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making.\\nThe former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook).\\nThe latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989).\\nDoes the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents?\\nOn face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework.\\nIn practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions.\\nMany parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying.\\nOn many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met.\\nIn the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act.\\nThis is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership.\\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES\\nEach of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents.\\nJohn: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem'\\nCooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child.\\nFor example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems.\\nRather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988).\\nBecause they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions.\\nIn John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school.\\nHowever, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse.\\nThe evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures.\\nIn drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface.\\n\\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019\\nMrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother.\\nI used to come home in tears.\\u2019\\nThe school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019\\nIn addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something.\\nShe stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019\\nShe recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019.\\nFollowing the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services.\\nAccording to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend:\\nAll different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in.\\nWhen I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused.\\nThey said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour.\\nI went home in tears.\\nThey asked me to take the children for a full medical.\\nI didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it.\\nI felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think.\\nFrom the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down.\\nAccording to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs.\\nConsequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019.\\nThe parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement.\\nThe parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete.\\nCooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs.\\nOn the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions.\\nThe definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions.\\nJohn's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals.\\nThe educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019\\nFor this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John.\\nThe EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019\\nOn the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions.\\n\\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019\\nLikewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019.\\nHe also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement.\\nMrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him.\\nNone the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations.\\nShe felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers.\\nTo her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish.\\nIt's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along.\\nI get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019\\nHowever strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome.\\nGeorge: who needs support?, what support is needed?\\nIn this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus.\\nWe show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents.\\nGeorge is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town.\\nAccording to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019\\nGeorge comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties.\\nOne of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder.\\nThe family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school.\\nGeorge was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019.\\nHis teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019.\\nIn school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children.\\nHe disturbs their work.\\u2019\\nThose behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home.\\nAt the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school.\\nAs the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist:\\n(a)\\nDisruptive behaviour in school.\\n(b)\\nManagement problems at home identified by the parents themselves.\\nWe can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established.\\nThe main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school.\\nThe EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school.\\nThe EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour.\\nHowever, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019\\nTheir stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school.\\nAs regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school.\\nThey acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home.\\nIt is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context.\\nWhen it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative .\\nIt was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations.\\nThis is illustrated in the following exchange:\\nMr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break.\\nI don't know if there's anything like that round here.\\nYou've got to think of the kids as well.\\nThey've never had any holiday.\\nEP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays.\\nI do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs.\\nNot because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings.\\nLet's try and get some help for you and the family.\\nThus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling.\\nOnce this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward.\\nThe different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting.\\nThe EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems.\\nMr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019\\nWhen questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school.\\nThey also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement.\\nMrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week.\\nElder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school].\\nIt makes him worse.\\nJohn says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019\\nYet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience.\\n\\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment.\\nI didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019\\nThe professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019\\nThe parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views.\\nIn a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs.\\nEP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding.\\nMrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school.\\nEP : That's where you would like him to go?\\nMr and Mrs Short : Yes.\\nEP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee.\\nMr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse.\\nThe psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation.\\nThis contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school.\\nThe psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him.\\n\\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them.\\nI think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019\\nThe psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019.\\nEP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look.\\nMr and Mrs Short : That's OK.\\nThe validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess.\\nIn the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019.\\nWhether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George.\\nMr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon.\\nMrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school.\\nIt's going to make him worse.\\nTom: refusing to play the game\\nOur third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control.\\nIt raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action.\\nTwelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children.\\nThis placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour.\\nAfter the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each.\\nMrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed.\\nMr Jones did not agree.\\nHe felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had.\\nTom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school.\\nThe EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required.\\nIn his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement.\\nTom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him.\\nInitially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour.\\nOnce the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned.\\nShe complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving.\\nPerhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome.\\nMrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy.\\nWhen she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019.\\nShe couldn't recollect having been informed of this.\\nIn any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019\\nMrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019\\nAccess to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced.\\nA lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated.\\nWhereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area.\\n\\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019\\nYet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling.\\nIn addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school.\\nShe had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties.\\nShe had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019.\\nYet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom.\\nNone the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling.\\nMrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019\\nOn the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests.\\nOnce the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law.\\nBut she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs.\\nShe had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power.\\nShe therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures.\\nShe moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit.\\nThe EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli .\\nAccording to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019.\\nDISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP\\nThe 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process.\\nIt identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment.\\nMoreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations.\\nA strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views.\\nIn practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence.\\nA number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process.\\nDyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families.\\nThis information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence.\\nChaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors.\\nGoacher et al .\\n(1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play.\\n\\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al .\\n1988: 59).\\nIt might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role.\\nYet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents.\\nNone the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces.\\nMittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019.\\nWhilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control.\\nSwann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed.\\nThis, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing.\\nBecause Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process.\\nIf Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led.\\nThe 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice.\\nAs Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193).\\nThe way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power.\\nThe Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019.\\n\\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children.\\nThis shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties.\\nNone the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988).\\nAn important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined.\\nOn the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process.\\nDespite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise.\\nParental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals.\\nParents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised.\\nMoreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment.\\nBy conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents.\\nWe can see how this occurred in our first two case studies.\\nIn both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed.\\nIn the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs.\\nWhereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment.\\nShe, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created.\\nUltimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs.\\nIn her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act.\\nHer direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs.\\nIn addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants.\\nBy securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice.\\nThus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThis article arises out of a research project on the \\u2018Identification of Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties: Participant

work at all, but  my one's just like  lukewarm.\\nOh well, let's have a look.\\nLet's have a look at this \\nSo \\nthen, this\\nwe did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess \\nNo.\\naround and try and do any more.\\nNo, no.\\nThat's right.\\nCos we just got a real fright  when we couldn't stop the water pouring out.\\nOh.\\nIt's the little washer thing.\\nJust turn the tap.\\nWell I'll get cleaned.\\nCome on, you take the stuff down and rather me just try and .\\n \\nAnd then er, once I've done that I've gotta nip up the top and get a comb.\\nI know I do I forgot to take one down to the place with me  I checked the then that, now we go \\nIt's alright, I'll get you one in Twickenham and I'll

so  the thing, and that goes in here, can use\\nOh!\\nWhat, is it a spanner?\\nIt's a sa kinda ratchet type thing.\\nOh.\\nJust that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough.\\nJust  thingie that\\nStill, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out?\\nNo, not let the water out, you let the air out.\\nWhen you bleed \\nOh I see.\\nit you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it.\\nOh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that\\nOh it's alright.\\nbut it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively.\\nI mean, obviously it's off now but erm\\nIs\\nAngie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer.\\nHello?\\nThat's got a  a key down there.\\nOh.\\nOh.\\nYeah I said we'd erm  drive over to Marion's on our way out and then  give her a pressie.\\nMm.\\nI had a really nice meal actually in erm  tt  a place in

a bit different actually to the ones we had.\\nThey don't like, used to have a little  .\\nThat one's quite hot I think.\\nThat's erm  something or other.\\nOr just put it onto your  poppadom like that.\\nEasier to put it straight on.\\nMm.\\nSo we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff?\\nWell mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you \\nOh.\\nget it on one.\\nBecause she hasn't worked, nothing?\\nMm.\\nWell, so  and th , and the husband\\nSo married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered?\\nOr are they not?\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least.\\nIs, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing.\\nOh right.\\nBut  it's not so much nowadays though.\\nYou have a  the problem   if the husband remarries.\\nYeah.\\nEr, er, you know, who gets the\\nI suppose it's pretty difficult really.\\nNo you can't.\\nSorry.\\nErm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets \\nOh!\\na widow's pension from the bank \\nOh right.\\nso that she doesn't  so we get nothing for\\nOh right.\\nIt's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really?\\nOh  yeah.\\nAnd of course even that's going to change as time goes on.\\nReally?\\nSo what happens like, with me?\\nLike teaching?\\nDo I need to do  I, they don't do anything \\nWell you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact.\\nYeah.\\nCos obviously  it's different for you.\\nThat's the thing.\\nErm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something\\nMm.\\ner soon after you start your job.\\nYeah.\\nI'll think about it \\nSo, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty.\\nYeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one.\\nI'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four\\nMm.\\nwhen I qualify.\\nSeems sensible to start as soon as possible really.\\nWell you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy.\\nYeah.\\nThen take the twenty five or thirty years.\\nIs that what you've done?\\nThat's how you're paying?\\nNo.\\nThe two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on \\nOh right.\\nand when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine.\\nOh right.\\nThat's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one \\nOh right.\\nof you, for you.\\nYeah.\\nAnd the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid.\\nYeah.\\npaying tax on the interest.\\nOh right.\\nAnd then just utilize a little each year.\\nYeah.\\nOh right.\\nWe should get help with James though shouldn't we?\\nWell  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for \\nOh.\\nJames so, if there is something, all well and good.\\nOh yeah.\\nI don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks\\nMm.\\nyou're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock.\\nAnd you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or\\nWell the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked.\\nGone into erm  money .\\nAnd that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free.\\nYeah.\\nOh!\\nSo again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name.\\nOr grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's.\\nYeah.\\nThere's not that much there though is there?\\nThere's enough.\\nReally?\\nYeah, it's erm\\nDid you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn?\\nYes.\\nIt was very pleasant.\\nThe  the journey up there was erm \\nMum said , your mum's going a bit mental?\\nOh, probably is.\\nTo put it politely.\\nI expect she is.\\nDoes she see your brother much?\\nShe sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round.\\nReally?\\nMm.\\nOh good.\\nWell my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable\\nYeah.\\ner i in her place.\\nIt's been wonderful!\\nMum said it's really nice.\\nMm.\\nWhat is it?\\nIt's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for?\\nAlong , along th that sort of line.\\nErm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can \\nYeah.\\npull a cord  and they erm use a \\nIt's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to \\nOh that's true.\\ntidy it up.\\nAnd this is really what\\nSo is it, is it private or  or erm \\nWell it's her trust.\\nOh.\\nIt's her trust.\\nSo she pays?\\nShe pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm \\nSubsidised.\\nThat's right.\\nYeah.\\nThis is really what Ma-in-law should have done.\\nYeah.\\nAbout the same sort of thing.\\nOh yeah.\\nWell, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up.\\nSorry?\\nMum's fed up.\\nOh yeah.\\nShe was telling me the other day.\\nBut it's just \\nBut erm \\nI dunno, it's just so awful!\\nWell\\nIt just turned everything so sour.\\nMm.\\nBut it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her.\\nBut you, you just see to much of her that now\\nYeah.\\nthat it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or \\nMm!\\nor no , you know, anything.\\nWell no, you see\\nWell perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything.\\nI don't know.\\nBut the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off.\\nAnd, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward \\nNo.\\nthe children.\\nYeah.\\nAnd as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot!\\nYeah.\\nMm mm.\\nI was going mental!\\nWell that's it.\\nSo what did she say to you?\\nNothing.\\nWell,\\nI do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five\\nYeah.\\npeople in the house\\nIt's very stressful.\\nI'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there \\nYeah.\\nisn't a space there.\\nWell not if it's not designed for it.\\nI said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here.\\nMm.\\nAnd course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself.\\nWell there's nothing , yeah.\\nYou just can't do it.\\nBut if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us \\nMm mm.\\nbetween Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve \\nWell it's \\nand herself.\\nYes.\\nWhich is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William.\\nSure.\\nYou know, like more, more brother,si \\nYeah.\\nbrother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else.\\nBut, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off.\\nMum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff.\\nBut there is an underlined current there \\nMm.\\nwhich is erm, Mum is aware of.\\nOh definitely.\\nBut  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co \\nYeah.\\nand, and settle down in Brentwood.\\nI'm, I, I'm sorry.\\nIt's happened too many times now that she's \\nYou can \\nreally just, you can't break it.\\nYou can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her \\nYeah.\\nand will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her.\\nVery, very difficult.\\nWell  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead\\nYeah.\\nget on with it.\\nThere's no point ruining  a good relationship by \\nThat's right.\\nYeah.\\nthings like that.\\nJust turns everything sour.\\nSo how was your weekend \\nAh.\\nin  Sheffield?\\nDid you go wa , get around to see much at all?\\nErm, not much.\\nWhat did we do?\\nThe Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well.\\nYou'd gone up in, oh

mild korma down here please?\\nchicken korma.\\nYep.\\nOkay.\\nAnd the king prawn korma.\\nAnd the king prawn korma.\\nDo you want another ?\\nNot for me thanks, no.\\nErm  what do you want the, the the  paratha \\nPi , pilau, yeah.\\nOne of those do you?\\nJust one of the  paratha \\nYeah, just one.\\nAnd, we wanted?\\nOne pilau and one mushroom\\nOne pilau and\\none mushroom\\nand one mushroom

lot.\\nRight.\\nThank you.\\nOkay?\\nOne chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha \\nThat's it.\\nLovely.\\nThank you very much.\\nLovely , thank you.\\nYeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy.\\nIt was really good actually.\\nWe went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub.\\nIt was pouring down with rain though.\\nSo heavy!\\nWe got so soaked.\\nWe couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking.\\nYippee!\\nOh there is it?\\nOh!\\nWhat's happened now?\\nLooks a bit dead to me.\\n!\\nI had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers.\\nSo he smiled at me.\\nYeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice.\\nHe was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something.\\nBut he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so.\\nOh I see.\\nWhere was this, down Lincoln Avenue?\\nJus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham.\\nIt's the roads  you know where our house is?\\nJust \\nYeah.\\nthe road sort of, sort of here.\\nOh!\\nI see.\\nYeah.\\nThat's where it was.\\nOnly takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort \\nOh I see!\\nof stuff.\\nJust sort of up that way.\\nOh yes.\\nSo that's good \\nSo it's quite good \\nisn't it?\\nSo it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away.\\nSo it's easier to go to Witham.\\nYou have to change \\nMm.\\nat Twickenham though, that's not too \\nOh oh.\\nbad.\\nBut you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car.\\nOh.\\nThat's alright.\\nAnd as well, as Vicky's on that line as well .\\nVicky .\\nSo I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham.\\nOh yeah.\\nSo I must go and see her.\\nI was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day \\nYes, you must.\\nor something.\\nYeah!\\nWell you'll have to go down there.\\nAnd she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well.\\nAnd Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton.\\nSo we're all sort of in the same, very \\nYes, oh yes you must \\nclose vicinity \\nwell \\nso we're all gonna go out for dinner or something.\\nWe said \\nYeah.\\nwhen we're all settled in.\\nSo I must give her a ring this week actually.\\nI didn't realize how close we were.\\nI'm so, I've \\nNo.\\ngot no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue.\\nYou should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where \\nI know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map.\\nYeah.\\nCos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off.\\nWell then \\nYeah.\\nI haven't got a clue where I'm going.\\nNo.\\nAs for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue.\\nI never used one before  until I came here .\\nWell, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a \\nHonestly I \\ntrain for\\nI really haven't got a clue.\\na form of transport.\\nSo I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going.\\nYeah.\\nHaven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet?\\nYeah , but I'm hopeless !\\nMm mm.\\nI just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me.\\nI'm, they must think I'm so thick !\\nI just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus .\\nAnd that's the way it goes .\\nOh right.\\nBit of a hopeless case come to think of it.\\nMaybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are.\\nIt's just such a worry though.\\nWell no, no.\\nNo, no.\\nTake the, take the map with, stick it in your bag.\\nI just tell everyone I'm new in the area.\\nSo I just say I'm really new in the area .\\nSo my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area.\\nThe thing is do , I don't think I'd know.\\nI wouldn't know how to get a bus .\\nI wouldn't have a clue where to go.\\nOh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at

one.\\nWell the thing is, er, I, I can\\nIt's quite nice how sensible he is in a way.\\nI, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family.\\nI think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there \\nYeah.\\ner er  he could become involved \\nYeah.\\nwith if he just let go\\nYeah.\\nCos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out\\nYes.\\ndrinking or whatever, and causing trouble.\\nThe thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up.\\nCos \\nMm.\\nI, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened.\\nYeah.\\nI'm sorry, but, you know, they're \\nI'm impressed with the warnings.\\nFor phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though.\\nYeah sure.\\nSure.\\nI think that's re , cos that's \\nHe \\nthe only way\\nYeah.\\ncos the majority \\nYes,

they are like.\\nI think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them.\\nWell,\\nWell they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave.\\nWell I ,.\\nI, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th \\nIt's no ignoring it\\nyeah, well the \\ntill it \\nthing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back \\nYeah.\\nto the U K. \\nBut it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble \\nMm.\\nwould stop.\\nI think you\\nCos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot.\\nNo, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house\\nYeah.\\nLovely thanks.\\nThanks.\\nAnother person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically.\\nYeah.\\nIt's sick!\\nYou can turn them off .\\nWell it's very jazzy in the surrounding.\\nOh

kept coming home with all his friends .\\nAnd then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on?\\nYes.\\nThat's it.\\nCome on mate, I'm starving!\\nNo, no  advances on his, on his salary soon.\\nIt reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels?\\nLike und , that was underneath?\\nD'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant?\\nOh yes!\\nYes I do.\\nThanks very much.\\nYes that was a little bit out.\\nBut, ah yes, I remember.\\nYes.\\nYeah.\\nCor!\\nYou have a long memory.\\nCertainly have.\\nIt's there somewhere.\\nDo you remember it?\\nYes.\\nThat's erm, that's quite a while ago actually.\\nWell yes, a couple of years ago.\\nIt was when James went to  Russia.\\nOh!\\nThat was it.\\nEr near, near er  Skiptia \\nOh yeah, that's why he wasn't there.\\nnear  Skiptov \\nOh that was it.\\nRobert was in, at, at, University.\\nYeah.\\nOh that was it.\\nShe must have been away so we took flight.\\nYeah.\\nThat was good actually.\\nIt was quite nice.\\nExcept of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels.\\nMy goodness me!\\nWas a bit of a mare wasn't it?\\nAh!\\nIt was terrible.\\nBecause the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me.\\nYeah.\\nAnd secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that \\nYeah.\\nwell.\\nHas he got a job?\\nI do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank.\\nWell I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back \\nMm.\\non the damn thing again.\\nWell I can't even find the M twenty five !\\nNo.\\nI was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty \\nYeah.\\nfive on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight?\\nYes it is.\\nAfter that, we started in trouble.\\nWe went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray.\\nOh yeah?\\nBang!\\nWe were on the motorway\\nwhere's this bloody sign!\\n  \\n\\nSo, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was.\\nOh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway.\\nBut, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come\\nokay\\nYou have to lose your way, come back, yeah.\\nThat's it.\\nSo we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island.\\nOh!\\nOh !\\nOh alright.\\nFair enough.\\nSo we stopped again.\\nI went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left.\\nSo, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all.\\nMm.\\nI said, what the bloody hell's happening here?\\nSo went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then\\nYeah.\\nthere it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island.\\nBut  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great.\\nWell it would be, yeah.\\nAh!\\nReally great!\\nAnd we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er \\nI'm not surprised.\\nTerrible!\\nTerrible!\\nSo what is it, a, an actual island?\\nIt's an actual island, yes, and you see \\nAnd how bi , quite big, it must be quite big.\\nIs it big?\\nIt's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a \\nYou just take it over for the  weekend?\\nWell, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island \\nYeah.\\nthe  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath.\\nIt's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too \\nOh I see.\\nbecause of the water.\\nBut this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk.\\nOh.\\nOh blimey!\\nYeah th , the water level's just \\nReally?\\njust a, you know, way up above the  the main er\\nthing, yeah.\\nBut, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception  \\nOh I see.\\nOh quite pleasant.\\nMust cost them a fortune.\\nMm mm.\\nD'ya get everything paid for?\\nEverything paid for.\\nWell  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the\\nall yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all.\\nErm\\nDid they like your phone bill from erm\\nOh crikey!\\nThey won't be paying for that.\\nWhere was it?\\nOh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland.\\nThat's it.\\nI couldn't think where you'd been to .\\nOh.\\nNo,i , it should be that.\\nThe worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction \\nIt's not worth it  just for one week is it?\\nand then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some \\nWhy d'ya get up so early?\\nYou know just to  well ease myself in really.\\nI, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call\\nMental man!\\ner, no not really.\\nReally ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out.\\nI had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television.\\nCos you can put the channel just to show the time  and \\nOh right.\\nand one or two others.\\nOh that's right.\\nErm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine.\\nOh!\\nI was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time.\\nAh oh.\\nYou know.\\nYou're not as dumb as you look are you?\\nNo , no.\\nWell the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm\\n,.\\nfirst erm  meeting.\\nGive your apologies as you walk in  \\nWell yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if \\nYou know these, these , V P's\\nV P's, yeah.\\nsits down and says .\\nSo this time I was determined not to erm, get caught.\\nAnd it's paid off.\\nIt was a, a nice place.\\nNice and sunny.\\nBa , I had \\nYeah.\\nlunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till  till quarter to two  erm  and then went back inside.\\nBut you, you sat outside for the best part of  quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, cos it was so sunny.\\nAnd it was a \\nWhen the weather's nice it's just lovely, really nice \\nOh it's beautiful!\\nYes.\\nIt's just  and it's so, it's like it was raining the other day when we went to go out  and just could not be bothered.\\nIt was really \\nMm.\\npelting down.\\nOh it was when we were gonna go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no, I really cannot be bothered, it's just pouring down with rain, had to \\nYeah.\\nget the bus and I thought, oh er  so luckily Lisa sa , like they said, oh don't be silly we'll come and get you.\\nSo luckily, they like drove round and picked me up \\nOh I see.\\nand just brought me back again, which is fine.\\nRight.\\nBut , just when you've got no transport and it's \\nMm mm.\\npouring down with rain it's  it's just such an effort  to motivate yourself to get up to \\nOh God!\\nYeah.\\nIt's like when we had no wa , like heating  or water, it was such an effort to  get yourself up \\nYeah.\\nto get ready to go out and the \\nYeah.\\njust, cold showers and stuff are like\\nOh bloody hell!\\nnot on my list of like  pleasurable er \\nNo.\\nthings to do.\\nJust like, no way!\\nNo I  I mean,we , I say, we sat out there and the peacocks are there  peahens.\\nOh yeah!\\nOh really?\\nMm mm.\\nI see.\\nI say, it i , it's nice, I mean, unless you  you really know about it  you have no idea at all.\\nNo.\\nNo idea.\\nI suppose a lot of business might be done through word of mouth as well.\\nMm mm.\\nIf anything.\\nThe kind of thing you ought to do with  with mum is like, you could probably go down one Sunday and have a, have a, you know, have a lunch.\\nIt'll be\\nYeah.\\nvisit  \\nIt's not that far is it?\\nWell it took us, as I say, an hour and a quarter.\\nPick me up on the way.\\nHa, ha, ha!\\nJoke!\\nI see , so we go round the M \\n

doesn't count.\\nWell let's see if I've got any money.\\nMy God!\\nI think I paid it in.\\nMakes me laugh!\\nWhat a joker, eh?\\nMm mm.\\nBut those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet.\\nI'm used to it.\\nI do the dishes every day.\\nQuite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment.\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nGot a lot less at home than erm \\nI'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it.\\nYeah.\\nWell a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books.\\nSure.\\nOh \\nSo \\ndon't worry about that.\\nThat'll be their books  upstairs.\\nAh but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it!\\nOh yeah.\\nWell that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there.\\nThere's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like\\nOh yes.\\nthis, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me\\nYeah sure.\\nlike if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt.\\nAnd it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room.\\nOh this isn't our room.\\nWe had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking.\\nOh dear!\\nSo embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed.\\nI saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ?\\nHe was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue.\\nEspecially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there.\\nYou know, like trying to stop it with our finger \\nYeah, sure, yeah.\\nand it was ju , it was burning our finger \\nYo , yes sure.\\nAnd squirting \\nAnd they \\nthe\\nyeah, they had like  like three towels.\\nIt's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on?\\nYeah, that's what fell out.\\nYeah.\\nI mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever.\\nUndid it too much, yeah sure.\\nYes you'd have to be \\nAnd then just it was, it was literally spurting out\\nYeah.\\nand it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's \\nNo, no, no.\\nbeen pumped through\\nPumping through, yeah.\\nAnd course it's got, pushing it \\nSo we still had all this boiling water \\nYeah.\\nand we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger.\\nAnd of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us.\\nMm mm.\\nSoaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere \\nOh God!\\nYeah.\\nAnd you got, in the end we just laughed.\\nAnd it, it came through to you?\\nIt came through yours?\\nYeah.\\nBecause, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized.\\nSo, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached\\nOh!\\nNo!\\nso she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward.\\nAngie went flying off, my pens went everywhere!\\nOh God!\\nAnd we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse.\\nWhat happened to your word processor?\\nIt was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd \\nOh I see.\\nAnd then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in.\\nAnd then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face!\\nOh no!\\nCut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to \\nOh!\\nlike try and mend that.\\nThen he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs.\\nOh God!\\nAnd then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent.\\nAnd, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing\\nYeah.\\ncos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark.\\nMella Mentha?\\nBombay Cassata?\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nI wanted a Lemon Delight.\\nYou Lemon Delight?\\nYeah.\\nMm.\\nSorry.\\nThanks.\\nDidn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight.\\nAnd erm \\nDelicious!\\nOh!\\nWanna take this stuff as a souvenir?\\nWell I'll take the umbrella, yeah.\\nOh.\\nGreat!\\nTuck in.\\nStart.\\nNo that's alright.\\nIt won't get cold.\\nSo of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold!\\nI've just heard what you said.\\nOh dear.\\nI'm on the ball tonight.\\nSomeone is slowing up.\\nIt's getting late.\\nSo, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down.\\nWe're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright?\\nAnd there was no answer.\\nSo we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down.\\nCourse we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark \\nOh God!\\nhaving a laugh on our behalf.\\nSo he came out and  we really slapped him hard !\\nWe thought that was \\nOh God!\\nreally out of order.\\nBut, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're \\nOh God!\\nin the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out.\\nAnd then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep.\\nAnd we're just like, oh God!\\nAnd then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere.\\nOh no!\\nOh dear.\\nAnd then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state.\\nHe'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on.\\nSo we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster .\\nAnd he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home.\\nHas he found a place now then or is he \\nYeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth.\\nWhich is quite a way out actually.\\nIt's \\nWhat's \\non the way to \\nand he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day?\\nYeah.\\nBloody hell!\\nYou alright?\\nYes.\\nYeah.\\nI'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight.\\nSo, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy.\\nOh I see.\\nHe seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well.\\nToo, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you?\\nOh eh?\\nOh he does it anyway.\\nI think he'll just crash at our house.\\nHe knows he's \\nYeah.\\nhe's more than welcome to crash at ours.\\nI mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something.\\nOr  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride.\\nOh yes.\\nOur cycle ride's just about long enough.\\nAnd he's, he, he he doesn't \\nIt's get \\ndrive?\\nthe worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like \\nYeah, sure.\\nYes.\\nthat is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even \\nMm.\\nlike the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit.\\nYeah.\\nCos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across.\\nOh I see.\\nWell yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it.\\nMm mm.\\nAnd everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college.\\nAnd that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever!\\nYeah.\\nLuckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die!\\nThere's quite a stretch though there.\\nYeah.\\nYou can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it?\\nJoining on the motorway bit.\\nMm.\\nMade it for me specially.\\nYeah.\\nQuite nice.\\nIs it?\\nIt's beautiful.\\nMm.\\nBombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now.\\nIt's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into \\nMm.\\ncollege so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car.\\nOh sure.\\nThe weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone.\\nI don't mind

Mm!\\nGorgeous!\\nIs it?\\nMm.\\nWant a bit?\\nNo I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours.\\nYou can have my cherry though.\\nMm.\\nWhat is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually.\\nNice actually.\\nIt's nice and light.\\nBeautiful!\\nSo what time do you expect your  friends home this evening?\\nDon't know.\\nIf they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something.\\nMm.\\nWell they're altogether so I suppose \\nMm.\\nin that way  they're relatively safe.\\nSo don't sit up worrying about them.\\nBut erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway!\\nOh yes.\\nCos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back.\\nBlimey!\\nPlus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night.\\nYeah.\\nBut apparently, it's meant to be really good there.\\nReally good erm  like Irish, sort of pub.\\nMm.\\nPub.\\nBut I would, I will go there sometime.\\nBut I  .\\nLovely.\\nMm.\\nIs yours alright?\\nVery nice.\\nWant a bit?\\nOh that's nice.\\nSomething cold and refreshing actually.\\nMm.\\nCos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in.\\nOh oh!\\nWill your transport be laid on or\\nI don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever\\nYeah.\\nthen erm  there \\nWhat's \\nmight be a coach.\\nIf not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school.\\nSo, you'll see.\\nSo I'll just see.\\nBut we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out.\\nCos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there.\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nIf I'm told to get the  whatever bus.\\nYeah.\\nCos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself .\\nMm.\\nWouldn't have a clue.\\nBut I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know.\\nHow often do you  that then?\\nWell  the train.\\nCos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth.\\nWhich is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think.\\nOh.\\nSo it's fine.\\nCos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired.\\nCos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off.\\nMm.\\nAnd then we do another four weeks.\\nOh.\\nI think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day\\nSure.\\nand maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever.\\nThe, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after \\nOh I see.\\nhalf term.\\nAnd what sort of age?\\nI'm with erm  nine and ten years olds.\\nMm.\\nYear five.\\nYeah.\\nI think so.\\nOh yeah.\\nI know, but I've never ever taught that age group before.\\nWell thump them one will you?\\nEvery time they get cocky, thump them!\\nYeah.\\nI've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds.\\nSo it'll be quite an experience.\\nMhm.\\nIt's gonna be so exhausting though.\\nYou get, we get assessed on it as well.\\nOh well.\\nYou fail those things and you're out basically.\\nIs there a, is there, is that a fact?\\nSo you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go.\\nAnd so \\nYeah.\\nBasically lesson pattern stuff.\\nCos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and \\nOh I see.\\nfit in with whatever, like their curriculum.\\nWell if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you?\\nCos I can always  sort of \\nYeah.\\nnip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then \\nYeah.\\nerm  bring it back to you.\\nYou know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening.\\nYeah.\\nOh cheers.\\nWell you're nearer than Robert was, yes.\\nYeah.\\nCos it's not too bad.\\nIt's really handy.\\nI , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all.\\nIt's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a \\nYeah.\\nrather heavy going.\\nWell it's so handy though.\\nIt's really like, like a big plus side to it.\\nMm.\\nI mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well.\\nJust so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour.\\nOh sure.\\nYeah.\\nOr people could be up within \\nYeah.\\nan hour to see me.\\nWell just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up.\\nMost people that I know have got cars.\\nYes.\\nLike Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up.\\nWell, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so\\nMm.\\nnow he was at Richmond.\\nAnd I phoned his house and he didn't phone back.\\nOh my God!\\nHe was down the pub.\\nBeast!\\nDear oh dear!\\nAnd he doesn't even drink!\\nHim and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er \\nOh yeah.\\nclay pigeon shooting.\\nIn , he loves it.\\nJust goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and

big impact in the blue-chip art market\\nBy EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH\\nMany column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting.\\nVery little has been said about the boom in modern prints.\\nIn some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art.\\nPeter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market.\\n\\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money.\\nIt is more like actual currency.\\nThe reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique.\\nWhen other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be.\\nIt is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019\\nNot every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however.\\nThe blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names.\\nThere are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault.\\nThere are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis.\\nThere are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney.\\nWhat are the rules of admission to the pantheon?\\nFirst, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019.\\nSecond, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply.\\nThird, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field.\\nAll of these are fairly obvious.\\nBut there are two other, less obvious laws as well.\\nPrints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper.\\nEdvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality.\\nThe final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese.\\nThe Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations.\\nJapanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage.\\nThey do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans.\\nThey are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium.\\nJapanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing.\\nThe way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste.\\n\\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne.\\n\\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019\\nAs a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing.\\nThis makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions.\\nThe Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250.\\nBut now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro.\\nSomething they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz.\\nOccasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally.\\nAn example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts.\\nWhat they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality.\\nHow much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost?\\nThis is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again.\\nA recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high.\\nA big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000.\\nSpectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000.\\nSo do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan).\\nThe benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000.\\nMatisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness.\\nA beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more.\\nImages from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition.\\nThe established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney.\\nImages from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000.\\nIn recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform.\\nToday, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000.\\nObviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded.\\nBut what about the long-term

              "\"Blood in her factory; another body found, and possibly identified. (The news had spread around in spite of police silence. No true blue inhabitant of Paradise Street or Mouncy Street ever needed to be told anything from the police; they had ways of finding out.) Rose put on more make-up and let her workers know it was business as usual. Under her firm gaze they bent to their machines. She had given Lily a holiday with pay, but Lily had obstinately reappeared and was working with the rest. Her face looked puffy. There was a truce between Rose and Gabriel, but none between Shirley and Gabriel because Gaby had discovered it to be Shirley who had leaked her secret to Rose. She had been searching Gaby's workroom, but she must have had her suspicions before. I suppose I'm easily read, thought Gabriel. In future she would be more careful. Discovery did not alter her plans, only slowed them down. Dagmar Blond moved about the factory as an unfriendly, enigmatic figure. This was the face that Paradise Street turned on outsiders. Steve had gone back to school, where he kept his head down and avoided his enemies; he felt as if the whole school was his enemy. Where Ephraim was no one knew. Rose shut herself into her office, grimly applying herself to routine. She was expecting another visit from the police. And not about what had been found in the factory. There was something else. She knew it. Dagmar knew it too, she could see it in her eyes. They would have to talk it over. John Coffin, on his way to work, stopped at the delicatessen to buy one of their warm ham rolls, then took it into Cat's Coffee Shop to eat with a cup of the best Kenya. He still had no kitchen. Cat was presiding in person behind the counter. A keen follower of fashions, he had been a notable Ted in his day, but had now abandoned the narrow trousers and sharp haircut in favour of golden locks curling on his shoulders worn with a loose striped robe bought in Egypt. He had retained his grandpa's Albert, however, and wore the watch chain looped round his neck like a medallion. At a table in the corner Coffin saw his friend, Philip Jordan, communicator of the news about Mossycop. â€˜Hello, Phil. What are you doing here? Coffee, please, Cat.â€™ â€˜Having breakfast, then going to Mouncy Street.â€™ Cat came across with the coffee, casting a disapproving glance at Coffin's ham roll. â€˜I could have done you one of those.â€™ â€˜I wanted one without you smoking hash all over it.â€™ â€˜I never.â€™ But there was no anger in Cat's voice; his bright, clear eyes were focusing in the distance, seeing eternal Peace and Joy. â€˜One bob. Peace, friend,â€™ he said, while sweeping the money into his pocket. â€˜Peace and Joy.â€™ â€˜So it was old Mossycop?â€™ Coffin stirred his coffee. All night he had been thinking: I've been sleeping over Mosse's dead body. â€˜Looks like it.â€™ Jordan drank his coffee down to the bottom. â€˜Eddie Davis was on the job. He looked down in the hole and he saw Mossycop in his uniform. You know he always wore it for gardening. â€˜My God,â€™ he said. â€˜It looks like Mossycop down there.â€™â€™ â€˜So who was it buried before, if it wasn't Mosse?â€™ â€˜Ask someone else. And guess who it was made the original identification and said, â€˜Yes, that's Uncle Mosseâ€™ and was his sole heir?â€™ â€˜Well, who?â€™ â€˜Rose Hilaire.â€™ Whichever way you looked at it, that name seemed to come up at every turn: Rose Hilaire mother of Steve, employer of Lily, and niece of a body under Coffin's floorboards. â€˜Do you know her?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ He must have bought his house off her remotely. There had been another name: Lee. They passed out of the shop together, side by side, falling automatically into step. Cat watched them go, all about him hung a sweet smoky smell. â€˜We'll raid you one day, Cat. So watch it,â€™ called Jordan companionably over his shoulder. Cat called after them, â€˜I can take criticism. But leave me my love-life.â€™ â€˜What's he mean?â€™ Coffin asked. Jordan shrugged. â€˜They call his place Shrew's Corner.â€™ â€˜Why shrew?â€™ â€˜Small, supple creatures with sharp teeth â€” that's the sort he likes.â€™ Coffin grunted. Yes, that was Cat's way of life: he would always be the sex that seemed fashionable at the time. At the bus stop he looked hopefully for Gabriel. No sign. Wonder where she is, he thought. Gabriel was sitting by Rose's side in the Porsche. Rose drove slowly, but her face was stiff with tension. Out of the corner of her eye she was watching Gabriel. She slowed down at the traffic lights by Sloane Street. The two women were on an inspection tour of the Rose Hilaire empire: Baker Street, Bond Street, Knightsbridge and Sloane Street. In spite of all her problems Rose was keeping to schedule. Baker Street had been inspected and its records checked. No one fingered the till in Rose's jurisdiction. Bond Street had been looked over and found wanting: the clothes not displayed as they should be, the new vendeuse lacking in charm. â€˜It's the wrong end of Bond Street,â€™ grumbled Rose. (Why hadn't the police been to see her? She would feel so much happier if they had and it was over. She had rehearsed what she would say.) â€˜It's getting too much like Carnaby Street, that patch.â€™ She avoided a car trying to turn right where it should not, and turned left. Her Sloane Street shop was between an  antique shop and a florist's. She had got the lease two years ago in 1964. â€˜I'm thinking of the Fulham Road. It's coming up fast.â€™ She parked the car. â€˜If Belmodes survives. Sometimes I think it'll all end up Biba.â€™ Sometimes Gabriel thought the same herself. She slumped lower in her seat and kept quiet. â€˜What chance have I got with little cows like you shortchanging me?â€™ â€˜Haven't done anything yet,â€™ muttered Gabriel. â€˜And nor will you. I've fixed it with Teddy Touch. I felt like leaving you to him. You almost deserve it, but not quite. No one deserves Teddy Touch.â€™ She turned in her seat to stare at Gabriel grimly. â€˜You don't know the rules of this dirty game yet, though you think you do. One day I'll teach you how to go about ditching your contract.â€™ She opened the car door and swung her long, beautiful legs out. She was one of those whom tights, as opposed to stockings, suited. She had better legs than Gabriel, and knew it. Her tights were pale, pale, a whiter shade of pale, only women with perfect legs can wear that shade. â€˜Oh no, darling, you didn't think you were the first clever little bitch to have the idea? It's been tried before, love, and better. It's the law of the jungle, kid, and you'd better know it.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ Gabriel got out of the car and side by side they walked into Belmodes, Sloane Street, in bad-tempered silence. Once inside the shop, however, acrimony faded; they were so alike that it was impossible for them to work together and be at odds. Gabriel saw at once that a bell-shaped shift of her own design was being wrongly displayed, while Rose saw to her fury that a whole line of trousers and tabards had been wrongly priced. The errors in both cases were minute, but the experts were angered. They advanced to attack. But before they could start in, Rose was called to the telephone. â€˜A call from the factory, Mrs Hilaire,â€™ said the shop manager. â€˜They said it's important. Asked you to ring back.â€™ She too had heard rumours, the telephones from shop to shop must have been red hot, and she looked at Rose with speculation. Gabriel sat down in a chair to wait, her gaze moving round the shop. Rose had chosen to have all her shops decorated in apricot and green with clear white paint; it looked stylish and fresh. In the background the latest Beatles' success was humming away. Rose had decreed there should be music in her shops, and she had selected the repertoire herself. It was changed every two months, making it an expensive item, but one Rose thought essential, as setting the character for an Hilaire shop. This particular jewel in the Hilaire crown looked in need of repolishing, however. To Gabriel's eye, there was a slight but perceptible air of neglect, due probably to a slack manager. The tall girl who had despatched Rose to the telephone was now studying her face in the wall mirror. Rose emerged from the back room with a swirl of skirts. Her face was flushed, but her mouth set in a firm line. â€˜Gaby, we're off. I'm wanted down there.â€™ Over her shoulder she said, â€˜Flavia, I shall be back. I'm not happy with the look of things here. You've let it go. Pull it up or you're out.â€™ As they drove off with some fast acceleration, Rose said, â€˜She's probably out, anyway. I've had my eye on her. Stupid cow, she thinks I don't know what goes on. Her boyfriend has taught her to drink. Worse too, I expect. No, she'll have to go.â€™ Gabriel kept quiet, well aware she was not Rose's favourite girl either. She would have liked to ask what was up, but questions were not invited. â€˜Right here,â€™ she said seeing that Rose seemed to be about to drive on, unthinking. Rose turned right, and seemed to relax a little. Being Rose, this gave her energy to devote to Gabriel. â€˜That Charley: he's a good photographer.â€™ So Rose not only knew, but had seen; somehow she had got hold of Charley's photographs. That needed thinking about. â€˜He's clever.â€™ He was more than that, but hard to say what. Inside, Charley was hard to gauge. Rose laughed. â€˜You're surprised? You're like that girl Flavia: you think I don't know what goes on around me, but I've got my eyes open.â€™ Shirley's eyes, too, no doubt. â€˜Do you live with him?â€™ â€˜No. Not in that way. Sometimes he stays around, but it's only a matter of convenience when we're working. If it's any business of yours.â€™ â€˜None, of course. But you're jealous of him.â€™ â€˜I might be,â€™ muttered Gabriel, stung. She was jealous. Charley did not make love to her, and he ought. She felt very strongly that he ought to want to. She might say no, but he ought to try. Her conclusion was that there was someone else. But she'd never seen that someone. It was tough being jealous of a nobody. Rose gave a laugh. â€˜You kid, you've got a lot to learn.â€™ â€˜I'll learn it.â€™ â€˜We all think that,â€™ said Rose. â€˜But somehow you never learn quite enough. Take it from me.â€™ She drove for a few minutes in silence, then she said, â€˜You know what I'm going back to?â€™ â€˜I can guess. The police want to see you.â€™ â€˜I've been expecting it ever since I heard that they found Uncle Mosse underneath the floorboards. I can't believe it.â€™ She shook her head. â€˜How could he be there? He's dead and buried.â€™ â€˜Perhaps someone dug him up.â€™ â€˜Oh, funny. Listen, I'm going to tell you this and you can believe it or not: Uncle Mosse had been dead about a week when they took me in to identify him. He could have been anyone but he was in the right place: on his own bed in his own house in Mouncy Street, so it had to be him. Only now it looks as if it wasn't. Rose sounded angry, exasperated with life for arranging things so badly. â€˜Not his fault,â€™ said Gabriel in a placatory way. Trying in spite of herself to be a peacemaker. â€˜I hadn't seen him for six years anyway. He hated the sight of me. There's no one he'd have wanted  seeing him dead less than me, and the feeling was mutual. But by then there was only him and me left.â€™ â€˜And your son.â€™ â€˜Steve? I kept him away from the old man. They weren't good for each other.â€™ Rose said it as if she did not realize what a strange but interesting thing she had said. Gabriel did realize. If I knew that policeman better, the one I met at the bus stop, she thought, I'd be tempted to tell him, because it tells you how Rose felt about her son. She fears him. Not that it would help the policeman understand Steve. Rose had a problem there. Manipulative, that boy. She thought anyone who loved Steve would be getting a very poor bargain indeed. But then, in matters of love and war, it is caveat emptor: Let the buyer watch out. She could see behind Rose's phrase a fear that Steve might indeed know something about the bodies. It was a nasty picture of family life. Gabriel herself had not had a happy family life, but a merciful providence, as she now saw it, had orphaned her early. She was a person it suited. No past, only a future. As they drew up to Belmodes, Rose said, â€˜I know you're a rotten little tyke in many ways, but professionally you're the tops. If I'm temporarily taken out of circulation, then you're in charge. I don't want Dagmar or Shirley.â€™ â€˜But what could take you out, Rose?â€™ â€˜Like being murdered or taken in by the police,â€™ said Rose, getting out of the car. As Gabriel trailed behind her boss's resolute stride she ought to have felt angry at the words of abuse, but she knew that they represented Rose's own fury and fear and she felt sympathy. â€˜At this rate, I may not be able to behave badly to her.â€™ At the entrance to Rose's office a plainclothes policewoman was standing. She spoke to Rose and the two women went into Rose's office. Gabriel hurried up to try to hear what was said, but the door closed in her face. After a short interval, the two came out again. As Rose left she cast a meaning glance at Gabriel, but she did not speak. All that day Rose did not come back, nor was there any message. Gabriel carried out Rose's instructions and kept the process of work going, ignoring the intense excitement of all the women. The sense of violence and anger, together with passionate interest, spilled out all over the place. This is what it is like being on the outside of a murder case, thought Gabriel. Close to, yet outside, and it's not good. â€˜Don't you think someone should go to tell Steve that his mother is not there?â€™ she said to Dagmar, as the day drew in. â€˜You do it.â€™ Gabriel picked up the telephone. â€˜Hook Road School, isn't it? I'll ask for the headmistress.â€™ A few years ago she might have found this impossible, the old London County Council preferring to keep its heads of schools at a distance without a telephone. This had changed; Miss Fraser could be reached. She put her problem, then listened to the answer, her face changing. Then she put the receiver down, turning towards Dagmar. â€˜He isn't there. They haven't seen him all day.â€™ Four â€˜What's she like, then?â€™ said John Coffin. â€˜I mean, to work with.â€™ Having had the good fortune to fall in with Gabriel outside Cat's Coffee Shop as she was on her way home, he had seized his chance and asked her for an early supper. Gabriel carefully buttered a roll. â€˜She's a good employer. I have to admit it, though in many ways she's a pain.â€™ She chewed her way though a good piece of the roll; she had eaten little that day. â€˜I wouldn't want her to go to prison.â€™ â€˜Hasn't come to that.â€™ Gabriel leaned across the table to grip his wrist. â€˜You'll find out for me what's going on, won't you? You promised.â€™ Coffin looked thoughtful. â€˜I might give someone a ring.â€™ Carefully he sorted out a few chips on his plate. â€˜It's not my case, you understand.â€™ He was to find himself repeating this often as the days went by. â€˜I'm going down to Mouncy Street now.â€™ He was going to collect a few possessions and move into Mrs Lorimer's for a bit. Impossible to live in his own house as things were. One body too many. â€˜I'll ring from there.â€™ â€˜See what you can do. Someone's got to tell her the boy's not been at school, isn't at home,â€™ Gabriel said, as if that was what it was all about. â€˜I'll have a go.â€™ He looked at his watch. â€˜You stay here and eat slowly. I'll be back.â€™ Gabriel looked at the wall. â€˜Can't you phone over there?â€™ â€˜Too public.â€™ She didn't have any idea of the way you eased into queries of this sort, and to have a jukebox banging out the Rolling Stones would not provide the right background. When he had gone, Gabriel went to the telephone herself. â€˜Charley?â€™ The Beatles had taken over from the Rolling Stones, but Gabriel, used to pop boiling over all around her, did not notice. â€˜Speaking,â€™ he said absently. At least he had answered the telephone. Quite hard to get through to Charley sometimes; when pressed he would simply say he was thinking. She called it Charley going incognito. â€˜Have you heard what's happened?â€™ â€˜No, what?â€™ He had been out working all day on a commission job for a fashionable hairdresser who was creating a branch in Los Angeles. He listened while Gabriel told him the day's events. â€˜You shouldn't have interfered. Stay out of it, Gaby.â€™ â€˜Rose is my employer, Charley, I want to know. I need to know. And then there's the boy.â€™ â€˜Oh, boys that age are a law unto themselves. He's got friends somewhere, I expect.â€™ What he said seemed to open up vistas, disquieting  views into a landscape she did not like. She did not think boys did go off on their own like that. And across her mind, like a slug, trailed a stream of unease. â€˜So there's this, Charley, I'll have to forget working for Touch. Rose has fixed that. For the time being I am all Rose's property.â€™ And what would she do with all the pretty clothes she had created, using Rose's time and Rose's machines, and which were now stored in what Charley called his Wardrobe, a deep cupboard in his studio in Mouncy Street? â€˜So that's all off?â€™ â€˜I'm thinking it over.â€™ She might as well let Rose have the designs, next season they would be out of date, but the price would have to be negotiated. â€˜Keep my products for the time being, will you?â€™ She could hear his dog Mop barking and whining in the background. â€˜What's up with Mop? He's usually so quiet.â€™ Gabriel went back to her table, conscious that Cat had been listening, but probably couldn't make more of it than he already knew. He leaned across the counter. â€˜How's Charley, then?â€™ So he had been listening. â€˜Fine.â€™ â€˜Haven't seen much of him lately.â€™ â€˜He's been very busy.â€™ Cat gave his counter a polish with a soft duster; he liked everything he owned to shine. Gabriel sat waiting for John Coffin to come back. He was taking his time. Why didn't she go down to his house to see for herself? But she shied away from the idea. Somehow, it wasn't a house she wanted to go into. â€˜Bring me another cup of coffee,â€™ she called to Cat. John Coffin came in just as she took a sip. Over the years, as a young detective he had lost weight at a time when a lot of men put it on, and now looked thin and wiry, reproducing in himself, as he half knew, the family look. Generations of his forebears had lived in London, with his bearing and bone structure. Genetically speaking, they were strong stock. He sat down across the table from Gabriel, thinking what to say. as if to aid him in his thought, Cat changed the music and let a waltz in. â€˜One worry's off your mind,â€™ said Coffin quietly. â€˜They've let Rose go home. And she knows about the boy.â€™ He picked up her coat. â€˜I'll see you back.â€™ Gabriel obeyed him, dutifully and suddenly quiet, asking no question. That ribbon of distress had knotted itself about her, tightening around her stomach which suddenly felt overfull of coffee and food. Pictures of Lily showing that bit of bloodied rag, of Lily's face as she launched her attack on Rose, came into her mind. She recalled Rose today in the shop, how brutal she could be in attack, but how straight. And as a background she could still see those policemen going in and out of the house in Mouncy Street the day she had seen John Coffin sitting outside. In retrospect they were predators moving in to destroy a site. So she found herself, a young hopeful woman, with  Coffin holding her hand, entering a world whose nastiness would never go away now. Once seen, this world stayed with you forever. He did take her hand as they went towards the bus. Not for the first time she wished she had a car. Might get a Mini. â€˜Well, talk me through it.â€™ â€˜Told you.â€™ â€˜No.â€™ Her voice was firm. â€˜You didn't.â€™ Perhaps policemen never did. He could hear his colleague Jordan's voice, unemotional on the telephone, not telling all even to him. â€˜She's a cool one all right. Yes, here all day.â€™ It was the way of things, always easier to get into a police station to answer questions than to get out again. As John Coffin had listened to Jordan's voice, he had a clear picture of the scene being summoned up so that Phil Jordan must be more of an actor than he had supposed. â€˜In a way, the laugh was on us.â€™ Rose Hilaire had sat stiffly upright, feet together, hands in her lap, refusing a cigarette â€”â€˜I don't smoke â€”â€™ although eventually accepting a cup of tea, during the drinking of which her hand was observed to shake. â€˜Yes, that was Uncle Mosse's AFS tunic. He wore it when he was doing any mucky jobs. Towards the end when he slipped out of himself a bitâ€¦ Perhaps he thought he still had the right to wear it. Didn't they ever give their uniforms back? Anyway, he hadn't.â€™ She had examined the tunic, looking at it carefully, but not touching it. She did not have to, where clothes were concerned she knew what she was talking about. One or two other questions, of a routine kind about the house in Mouncy Street, more to keep her talking, open her up, than anything else. They were working up to the crucial (as it was then) question of how and why she had come to identify the first body as Uncle Mossycop's. Rose Hilaire herself had nothing much to say. â€˜I only took a quick look, he'd been dead a long time, it wasn't nice, and yet â€” it looked like Uncle Mosse.â€™ This had been a perfectly human reaction: to look quickly at a dead relative, loved or otherwise. But they had to dig, and wanted to, because the cool Rose with the shaking hands irritated them. All the same, it was an unusual situation they were in and they wanted an answer, said Phil Jordan to John Coffin on the telephone. â€˜Of course, I was not conducting the questioning, John, but I was sitting in on it.â€™ All this time the bodies found, one after the other, in Mouncy Street, were being examined by the pathologists. Because of the composition of the soil underneath the Mouncy Street houses, decomposition of the bodies had been swift. This had been assisted by the existence in abundance of certain forms of animal life in the foundations: ants, cockroaches and flies had done their bit, but the mice and rats had had their flesh encounters too. The scientists were working in one place and in one way, the police in another. Between the pathologists and police communication was intermittent, for  they were parted by more than space. They were separated by the figure of Mossycop. The local police knew the legend of Mosse; to the scientists he was not even a name. â€˜Then the telephone rang,â€™ said Jordan, â€˜and that set us back on our heels. Gave Rose Hilaire the laugh all right. Not that she did laugh.â€™ Rose Hilaire had sat there, still bolt upright, to hear what they had to say. â€˜It wasn't Mossycop after all,â€™ Phil Jordan went on to tell Coffin. â€˜Not him but someone else wearing his uniform. A young lad, a boy; probably still an adolescent and little for his age at that. Another dead kid, and all dressed up in Mosse's old clothes. That's a problem in itself.â€™ There was a pause. â€˜We told her.â€™ Another pause. â€˜Then we told her about Steve being missing. And she took it all cold â€” she wasn't surprised.â€™ His voice sounded shaken. â€˜She was not surprised.â€™ John Coffin let this scene run through in his mind like a bit of a film while he walked beside Gabriel. â€˜Don't worry about Rose,â€™ he said. â€˜She knows about Steve, she knows as much as anyone can know about the deaths at the moment.â€™ And perhaps a little more, he thought: she was not surprised. Five Rose was sitting by her big window that overlooked the Thames when Steve came home. She had a glass of gin in her hand, but she was not drinking it, just holding it as if it might offer her the cheer and support that she might not otherwise find elsewhere. Gin had been the great popular comfort of Paradise Street in her childhood, gin and tea, so she took it as someone from another background might have made a dish of bread and milk. She heard his key in the door, and sat alert. She knew she had made a mistake in not showing more surprise to the police. They had noticed and she had seen them notice. Steve went quietly into the kitchen, she heard him opening the refrigerator door. Hungry. But of course, he wouldn't have eaten. â€˜Steve?â€™ He didn't answer, naturally not. But he stopped what he was doing and came into the room. That much relationship she still had with him, she thought. His feet in the heavy studded boots he insisted on wearing, clumsy on his thin ankles, marked the pale waxed wood of her floor. Normally she would have screamed at him for the minute splinters she knew he must be creating, but now she kept her anger for other matters. â€˜Where have you been?â€™ No answer. She looked at the huge sandwich in his hand. â€˜Wherever you go, they don't feed you.â€™ She saw him flinch; she'd scored a hit, then. It gave her no comfort. â€˜So what have you been doing?â€™ â€˜Just walking.â€™ A little grudging speech was allowed, then. â€˜You know you put me in a bad position going off like that. I was told by the police in the police station.â€™ He did look surprised at that. â€˜Yes, I was down there because they were questioning me about some old clothes. Uniform.â€™ She looked him full in the face as she spoke. And you're not surprised either, not totally, absolutely surprised. Somewhere at the back of your eyes is a show of recognition. â€˜You don't ask whose clothes,â€™ she said. â€˜Or why I was looking at them?â€™ Steve put his uneaten sandwich down on the table. â€˜Why don't you ask?â€™ Rose knew she should stop, she could hear herself shouting. This was not how to behave to your young son, but there was something about Steve's behaviour now that drove her on. In his own way, he knew how to pull her strings. She lowered her voice. â€˜There was another body under that first poor boy's. It looked like Uncle Mosse; it was wearing his old uniform. So naturally the police thought I'd identified the wrong body as Uncle.â€™ She added briefly, â€˜Well, it turns out I hadn't, not in the present state of the game. But they were his clothes.â€™ And why hadn't I felt that shock of surprise I should have felt? I could tell you why, Steve, but I won't  because I'm afraid you might know. Because Uncle Mosse left his door unlocked all the time at the end and he did not mind who came in and out, as he said. He liked company. Who's to say who drifted in, and then drifted out? Or sometimes, did not drift out? What do you know about that world, Steve? â€˜I remember that uniform,â€™ said Steve unexpectedly. â€˜It was fab; it had style.â€™ And what did he know about style? But he did; he was her child. She knew about style, so did Steve. â€˜I saw you put it on once.â€™ â€˜Yeah. It was great.â€™ So he was talking, but not saying things she wanted to hear. â€˜And that's why I kept you apart. He was not good for you, Steve.â€™ I am a grown woman, I lived in Paradise Street, I know about Uncle Mosse. Oh, perhaps they aren't bad in themselves, people like that, but they let the dirt in. Steve shrugged. Your view; I have my own, he seemed to be saying. Irritated, Rose returned to her main worry. â€˜And where were you walking, and why? Why not school? What excuse am I going to give there?â€™ Awkwardly he said, â€˜A person has a private life. Even a young person.â€™ Rose drew in a sharp breath. â€˜You've silenced me there, kid.â€™ Steve picked up his sandwich and went over to the television set where he sat eating it while he watched the news. At home the new Labour Government was  settling itself in. Abroad the Americans were bombing in Vietnam, Hanoi had been hit by American fighters. Without wanting to, Rose was drawn to watch. Mother and son sat in silence watching the scenes of violence unfold. The violence on the screen seeped out, rambled round the room like an animal, then joined them in the seats. On the screen a taker of LSD, the Vision-of-Hell-drug, was borne off on a stretcher, after having hallucinated he could fly. They all think they've got wings, thought Rose. â€˜If I ever thought you were mixed up in anything bad, Steve,â€™ she said, â€˜I think I'd kill you.â€™ Then she went and stood by the window, looking out. I am not pregnant, I have not taken a hallucinatory drug, and I have never killed anyone. If she said it often enough it might be true. She knew that, without meaning to, she had given away a lot of her life and thought, and wished she had not. Coffin and Gabriel (it was surprising how quickly he thought of them as a couple). â€˜Let us â€”â€™ he paused' â€” let's meet tomorrow.â€™ He thought about it. Tomorrow looked like being a day with a heavy workload, nor was dinner at Mrs Lorimer's entirely to be recommended. â€˜Let's go to a place I know. Little Italian restaurant.â€™ Whose proprietor was currently, as they say, in prison, but whose wife, mother and seven sisters were running the place. â€˜La Piazza: used to be called the Padovani.â€™ â€˜Oh, I know it. I was at school with the littlest Padovani.â€™ â€˜Yes, you might have been.â€™ That made her a good decade younger than he was, but she looked it. â€˜As an eating place it's had its ups and downs, but it's up at the moment.â€™ It was, in fact, better when its handsome but feckless proprietor was absent. His amours seemed to upset the cooking. â€˜I'll look forward to it.â€™ They turned the corner into the street where Gabriel lived; she had a tiny flat. â€˜What's she like, your boss? Really like?â€™ Gabriel said, â€˜I haven't much idea. She covers up, pretty well. Deep.â€™ â€˜I've never met her,â€™ said Coffin thoughtfully. â€˜I don't think.â€™ â€˜Oh, you'd know if you had. You don't overlook Rose if she's around. Tall, bright blue eyes, mass of hair. â€˜What colour?â€™ â€˜Oh, varies â€” sometimes pale blonde, sometimes more honey-coloured. I've even known her red, and that only in the eighteen months I've worked for her. But she's got style. She can't make it, but she can copy it.â€™ Gabriel spoke with feeling; she knew what she had contributed to Belmodes since she had started to work there. â€˜And what's she been like these last months?â€™ What he meant was: Did she act like a woman who might know too much about a murdered boy? â€˜Again, hard to say.â€™ Gabriel had been full of her own plans lately, perhaps not too observant. â€˜But she  has seemed under pressure. Her relationship with the boy has gone to pot lately. I think we all knew that and she didn't mind showing it. Don't know what was behind it. Maybe he didn't like her friends. Or she didn't like his.â€™ â€˜Think so?â€™ Gabriel shrugged. â€˜It's a funny old world â€” and people like Rose, well, they get mixed up in it.â€™ â€˜And you? Do you get mixed up?â€™ He didn't know where he placed Gabriel. She looked a bright, emancipated little bird, enjoying her freedom, but he thought he detected a native caution underneath her swinging exterior. â€˜In and out,â€™ said Gabriel. â€˜I won't ask questions.â€™ â€˜You already are,â€™ said Gabriel drily. â€˜You'll still have dinner with me?â€™ â€˜As long as you don't ask me who I voted for in the General Election.â€™ (The country was still sorting itself out after the Election.) â€˜Who did you vote for?â€™ â€˜Oh, I didn't bother.â€™ Coffin was shocked. Far away and long ago seemed the world after the War, into which he had emerged out of the army with the feeling that his vote and the new Labour Government would rebuild England. He still voted Labour, but he was no longer sure why. But not to use a vote, that was what had changed. A gap opened between them, and they both knew it was called age. But physical attraction could jump that gap like an  electric spark and did so effortlessly. He put his arm round her and they walked on. â€˜How do you feel about me being a policeman?â€™ A bus passed them, bringing with it a flurry of dry dust from the gutter. â€˜I never forget it for a minute,â€™ said Gabriel. â€˜Any more questions?â€™ I'm a slum kid, her eyes were saying, you know that, do you think we forget policemen? â€˜What's democracy in Paradise Street?â€™ Not policemen. This was not a question, it was an answer. Nevertheless, she would go on knowing him. They parted with barely a word, but with a strength of unexpressed feeling. They would meet, they would go on meeting, but already they were on opposite sides. Rose had enrolled Gabriel, with a jump of surprise the girl admitted it. While she had not been looking where she was going, Rose had quietly taken her support. Rose and Belmodes, it was, then. It was as if she had smelt a meal cooking in the next room; it might not be a meal she wanted to eat, but already it was nourishing her. John Coffin did not know he was on the wrong side yet, not having so far met Rose Hilaire, but he too realized that there might be a fight ahead. â€˜See you tomorrow.â€™ â€˜As ever is.â€™ Gabriel disappeared into her own flat, which was minute, one room and a bathroom, but which she shared with no one. The first upward step of any born in Paradise Street was a room of one's own. Very few people had seen inside Gabriel's flat, because that was the other rule for escapers from  Paradise Street: do not let the world outside get past your front door. â€˜Don't expect too much of me. Got a busy day tomorrow.â€™ It was always busy at this time of the year in Belmodes, preparing the collection for the next season. Murder or not it had to go on, and next day it did, Rose saw to that, although she was not herself. Rose Hilaire had a waking dream, one which followed her into sleep and came out again the other side to stay with her all day, going with her into Belmodes side by side like a fellow worker. As she slept in her Italian-designed tube steel bed with the iron-grey duvet, she felt sure that Steve in the room across the corridor must know who was in there with her, and as she went to work next day, she felt sure that everyone must see what she was dragging with her. Her nightmare self, her horrible double. In this dream she was outside herself, yet watching a person who must be herself strangling an adolescent boy. What she saw was detailed and specific, nothing vague or fancy. Just a pair of hands, reaching out at the end of her arms from her shoulders to grip a neck. Not exactly the sort of thought you wanted to pass on to the police at a time when two boys' bodies had been found. Yet one that was hard to keep to yourself, she could feel it bursting out all over her. Like a virulent disease. Someone was bound to notice. Excuse me, they might say, you have death all over your face, it could be serious. At work next day, discussing time-sheets and piecework rates with Dagmar, she could feel her skin irritating her. She put her hand up to her face. â€˜What is the matter with you, Rose? You keep touching your face.â€™ Dagmar was irritable. â€˜I'm having a little trouble with it.â€™ Dagmar did not answer. She had known Rose since before Rose was born, and had long since resolved to think nothing about Rose except what suited her. It did not suit her now to observe the emotional turmoil inside Rose. Herself the illegitimate daughter of a Danish sailor who had spent one month in Paradise Street before taking ship for ever, she had built herself a firmly structured life which could withstand all but atomic bombardment. â€˜You've got your warpaint on,â€™ she said. Rose was wearing a tulip-red trouser suit, diamond earrings and a large aquamarine ring. She grunted. â€˜If I didn't believe clothes helped, then I wouldn't be in this business.â€™ She sighed. â€˜But who said work helps?â€™ and pushed away from her desk. â€˜Are the police still in the washroom?â€™ Dagmar's expression did not change from her usual workday look of reserve. â€˜The police have gone, but the washroom's locked up and no one can get in. The girls are having to use the public lavatory on the corner and they don't like it.â€™ â€˜They won't go on strike, will they?â€™ Rose feared strikes even more than bankruptcy or the plague. â€˜I haven't heard them mention it,â€™ said Dagmar in a level voice. Rose got up and walked to the window. Her suit made of nylon had stuck to her and outlined her figure. Out of the window, she could see the street outside, with one of her own vans drawing away from the kerb. A smaller delivery van from a wholesaler was just moving into her unloading yard. That would be the Italian silk jersey arriving. Good news on an ordinary day, a delight to the eye. This was not an ordinary day. â€˜We don't know a lot, do we?â€™ she said, fixing her eyes on a policeman in uniform who was walking by. They were in the middle of the case, working in a building where bloodstained clothing had been found, and where two people whom the police had questioned about a missing boy had more than passing contact, yet they knew less than anyone. â€˜Any news about Ephraim?â€™ â€˜Not that I know. Anyway, Lily isn't in today.â€™ â€˜Just as well,â€™ said Rose uneasily. â€˜It's a difficult situation there. See she's paid, though, won't you?â€™ â€˜You're a good employer,â€™ said Dagmar grudgingly. â€˜Better than Grandpa? He kept a sweatshop if anyone did. Changed days, couldn't behave like that now. But I'm standing on his shoulders, Dagmar.â€™ â€˜And wouldn't he have loved it.â€™ For Dagmar that was a show of humour. Since her mother had been a jolly lady, her missing father must have been a dour Dane indeed if inheritance had anything to do with it. Rose came back into the room, and sat down at her desk. â€˜You don't think there's any special reason for Lily being away?â€™ â€˜Such as?â€™ â€˜Like Ephraim being found?â€™ â€˜Did cross my mind.â€™ â€˜You know something,â€™ said Rose suddenly. â€˜Not know. Saw.â€™ â€˜Oh, come on.â€™ â€˜You didn't drive down Mouncy Street from the main road this morning?â€™ â€˜No. Came round the other way from Decimus Street.â€™ She did not say that she was avoiding passing the house in Mouncy Street, but they both knew she was, and had been every day. â€˜Two police cars; and an ambulance. Drove off as I went past.â€™ Dagmar cycled from her flat in one of the new highrise blocks. â€˜Same house as before?â€™ asked Rose carefully. The one I used to own, she meant, the one the copper bought. â€˜That or the next one. Both been empty.â€™ â€˜Well, thanks for telling me.â€™ For Dagmar it had been tactfully done. â€˜We'll wait and see.â€™ And it might mean nothing. But the cameo of death formed in front of her eyes, small, brightly lit and detailed. She closed her eyes. â€˜I'll get you a cup of tea,â€™ said Dagmar. â€˜No. I've got to see Gaby. She's probably outside now.â€™ â€˜She can wait. You'd better tell me what's upsetting you. In a low tone, Rose said, â€˜Do you believe in anyone fantasizing murder? Have you ever heard of anyone doing that?â€™ Gaby, who was outside, heard the word murder and stayed to listen. It was wrong to do it, she knew, but she could not stop herself. She could not hear anything, of course, as Rose's voice dropped and was interrupted by the rumble of Dagmar's, but she heard enough. The question was whether she should tell anyone or no one what she had heard. That question was decided for her in a most terrible way. When the rumour reached Gabriel she began to realize what she would say to John Coffin. Rose had said, in a terrified whisper: â€˜Can you fantasize a murder? Feel sure that you saw one happen?â€™ She didn't hear Dagmar's response. But Rose said: â€˜I think I might be the killer. I was inside it, and outside it, at the same time.â€™ What Dagmar said then sounded like â€˜a dreamâ€™; she couldn't hear what answer Rose made to that, but she heard the words â€˜missingâ€™ and â€˜bloodâ€™. Gabriel tried to slot this into what the new death was all about; she was deeply troubled. She slipped out for a cup of coffee with Charley in his studio next to Belmodes; it was one of his days to be there. She had been able to tell that by the sight of his motorbike outside. He flitted about on this machine (which obsessed him) wearing a helmet and goggles so that Gabriel called him The Invisible Man. On wheels. â€˜What do you think I should do?â€™ she said to Charley. â€˜You always give me good advice: give me some now. â€˜Do I?â€™ â€˜I think so.â€™ A minute ticked by while Charley said nothing. Gabriel went on, â€˜And then I saw her that night, remember? In Mouncy Street. I told you. She was behaving oddly.â€™ â€˜Which night was that? Remind me.â€™ â€˜The night I worked late on my own. That was why I had a taxi. You had a job in Paris.â€™ â€˜Brussels,â€™ said Charley absently. â€˜I told you Brussels.â€™ Gabriel irritated him by the way she could get something nearly right but not quite. Charley sat silent, then took a deep breath. â€˜Tell them. You ask me, I say: Tell.â€™ By lunch-time the rumour was a hard story. So Gabriel knew she had to tell. And to her, in her present mood, that meant tell Coffin. Six â€˜Since you ask about the boy,â€™ said Phil Jordan to his friend John Coffin, â€˜I will tell you.â€™ â€˜But I didn't,â€™ Coffin said. They were drinking in the Red Anchor; it was noon or just past, and still a full working day. â€˜Oh, come on, that's why you asked me for a drink. And I'll have another. You owe me.â€™ â€˜Oh, all right.â€™ John Coffin got up. â€˜Well, you've got a right to know. He's in your garden. Three feet down and under a rose-bush. Identified by his clothes. But someone from the family will have to have a look.â€™ Coffin swallowed his drink. It went down badly, sour to his taste. His throat tightened. â€˜When?â€™ Jordan shrugged. â€˜Probably soon after he went missing. The forensics will take time.â€™ And hedge their bets, then. â€˜And how long is that?â€™ â€˜Almost three weeks.â€™ He added, â€˜Just after Bank Holiday. Labour Day.â€™ He had got the impression that for some reason this was important, but he did not know why. They drank in silence for a minute or two. Coffin said, â€˜I had the house then. Hadn't moved in, but I got the keys before the holiday. My house.â€™ â€˜I know.â€™ â€˜I had a look at the garden. He must have been there then.â€™ â€˜Looks like it.â€™ â€˜And the Big S?â€™ â€˜Sexual attack? Forensics say no obvious sign of it. But in my book it has to be there, one way or another. Yes, there was certainly a sexual gratification for the killer, whether man, woman or child.â€™ â€˜You mean that? Every word, even child?â€™ Jordan shrugged. â€˜They're at it younger and younger. We've both had cases.â€™ â€˜Damn.â€™ Jordan said, â€˜To tell you the truth, I don't think we're making a good job of it.â€™ Coffin looked at him. Not like Jordan to be self-critical. â€˜It slips away from us. As soon as we think we're making progress we seem to lose our grip. The forensics, the laboratory stuff â€” all the stuff we've taken in â€” soil, clothing fragments, even some flakes found on the first boy â€” they look promising, but we don't get any further. They don't point anywhere we can find. Or not without a bit of help. Perhaps this new body will give something extra.â€™ He frowned. Poor little beast. Perhaps his body would speak for him. It might have a lot to say. â€˜I hear they've got a problem to worry at there, but details I don't know.â€™ â€˜It's a lousy business, so it is.â€™ Jordan sighed and took a drink. â€˜Old Mossycop's the problem, he let anyone in to that place. Anyone could have had access. Got hold of a key, kept it. He  didn't seem to care. When someone like Mosse, who's had a kind of public face, goes wrong, he really beats all.â€™ â€˜Think so?â€™ It didn't seem entirely the problem to Coffin. Jordan thought again. â€˜No, it's not just that. I think the old man isn't handling it well. Can't seem to take the emotion. Remember when Tom Banbury went off it all? Lost his grip?â€™ â€˜He came back,â€™ said Coffin quickly, defensively. â€˜One or two good results after that.â€™ â€˜What's happened to him?â€™ â€˜Retired early. He died a year ago,â€™ said Coffin shortly; he had liked his first boss. â€˜Do you still keep in with the great man Dander?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ Commander Dander had been, still was, Coffin's patron. You needed a patron. Jordan knew all that, he was just asking for asking's sake. â€˜You're well in there. Gone right to the top, the lucky bastard.â€™ â€˜He's got a bit grand for me.â€™ â€˜Not what I hear.â€™ They drank for a moment before Jordan returned to what really worried him about his boss's handling of the case. â€˜The trouble is he can't talk to people. Not properly. Question, yes. Talk, no.â€™ â€˜Tom Banbury couldn't.â€™ Couldn't or wouldn't. â€˜In the end, I think, it killed him.â€™ Cancer of the larynx cannot come by accident. Or is it falling into the old sin of hubris to say you can will your own death? The real trouble with old Tom had been that when  he came into contact with the evil mind, the scheming, devious, manipulative mind of some murderers, he could not bear it. â€˜Someone ought to talk to the family connections,â€™ Coffin said aloud. â€˜People like Lily Bates.â€™ Someone ought to talk to Lily Bates, yes, that was what he had said and meant, but it might not have been him if he hadn't seen her for himself that afternoon between five and six, the period between Hook Road School closing and Rose leaving her office at Belmodes; the time Steve would have made his own. She was standing face to face with a boy in the public park at the end of Decimus Street. He recognized her at once because Gabriel had pointed her out to him and he thought the boy must be young Hilaire. It was a conjunction of two people at once unlikely and yet inevitable. Of course, she'd get at the boy if she could. He stopped to watch. Where they were talking was a children's playground, not much used; a small desolation of climbing frames and broken swings. The barbarians had passed over it and moved on. Afterwards he had to explain why he was there, and found it hard. I was just there, he said, but it wasn't true. He had gone there on purpose. Not thinking he could see them, but thinking he would see something. Driven there by some distant memory from his youth. It was a place where boys and vagrants went, had been for years. One of several in the district but the  one nearest to Mouncy Street. This was probably in his mind. Lily and the boy were standing by an old iron playhorse which had once been painted dark green but now was blotched with rust. Blessed with excellent long-range vision, he stood outside the play area, observing them. The boy had his back to him but he could see Lily's face and she was doing the talking. He stood there watching. â€˜Wish I could lip-read.â€™ But just watching was telling him something. They moved as in a dance. Now the boy Steve was doing the talking while Lily was listening, and that surprised him. The boy was going on at length with apparent fluency. From Lily's back he could tell nothing. A shame not to be able to hear, but he knew if he took one more step towards them the scene would break up and he would lose them. In the end it was the woman who gave ground and the boy who stayed. No doubt he should report it, and probably he would. But, after all, what could he say? That he had seen the two talking? And it wasn't his case. Not his case, but his feet thought otherwise. They followed Lily; sometimes, as detective, your feet do know best. He had to hope so, because his feet appeared to be following Lily, carrying him with them, willy-nilly. He went after Lily, not sure exactly what he would do. He followed her down one quiet suburban street after another till they approached the busy main road. Then she stopped and turned round. â€˜You're following me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go away or I'll call the police.â€™ Her eyes flicked towards the main road where a uniformed constable stood. She had led him there neatly. â€˜I'm sorry if I frightened you.â€™ She thought about him. â€˜You're a policeman yourself. â€˜I thought you'd recognize it.â€™ The policeman at the corner was looking interested. â€˜Don't count on that, son. Or being liked the more because of it.â€™ â€˜I don't.â€™ The uniformed policeman had begun a slow, thoughtful walk in their direction. Explanations could be made, but might not be easy. Not his case. â€˜So what do you want?â€™ Gabriel would have recognized that Lily was in one of her aggressive moods; they alternated with gentle or more co-operative states. â€˜I suppose I ought to expect to be bullied. Spied on.â€™ â€˜No one 's doing that.â€™ Not strictly true, he thought; no wonder some people have mixed feelings about us. I did exactly what she said. Still, my motives were good. He added politely, â€˜Mrs Bates?â€™ â€˜I'm in mourning, did you know that? My little nephew has been found. Dead. Murdered. More like a grandson than a nephew he was to me.â€™ â€˜I'm sorry. By now she'd had a good look at him. â€˜I've known you. I've seen you with Gaby.â€™ â€˜That's right.â€™ â€˜Does she know about Ephraim?â€™ â€˜Not yet.â€™ But she'd have to be told. â€˜I thought she didn't. Or she'd have let me know. In a kinder way than you lot did.â€™ â€˜It had to be the police tell,â€™ he said deprecatingly. â€˜Where do you live, Mrs Bates?â€™ She nodded to one of the row of tidy brick houses. â€˜Can we go in the house and talk? That's all I wanted.â€™ Also this young police constable was getting closer. Lily too had noticed the policeman by now and perhaps did not want to encounter him. â€˜Yes,â€™ she said quickly, and led the way to the house without hesitation. Inside, Lily's house was sunlit and quiet. She led him straight into an old-fashioned kitchen where a coal range gave out a dull red glow. He could smell cooking. â€˜Always keep a casserole going in the oven ready for when I come in from work. Always been a working woman. Had to be, and keep my family comfortable.â€™ â€˜You a widow?â€™ â€˜No, I've still got Dad, but he doesn't count for much now, poor love, he's gone a little bit silly.â€™ â€˜Ah.â€™ â€˜He can't walk, though, his legs have gone, so you needn't start having suspicious thoughts about him. He's upstairs now, asleep. Or thinking. He does a lot  of thinking even if he can't say what. As harmless as a baby. More harmless than some babies I've known.â€™ â€˜I don't know much about babies,â€™ said Coffin humbly. â€˜Oh, it's the ones that have a sharp look to them that you've got to watch out for. They're the bad ones. Look like little old men, they do, sometimes. Then you've got to watch what they grow up like.â€™ â€˜Poor little things.â€™ He felt a serious sympathy for the little ones looking like their own grandfathers; he had probably been such a one himself. â€˜And what about your nephew Ephraim? Was he one of the sharp ones?â€™ Lily didn't answer; she was bent down getting the casserole from the oven. The fragrant steam made his mouth water. After a bit she said, â€˜I don't know about Ephraim. I loved him, so it was harder to see.â€™ â€˜He lived with you?â€™ â€˜No. With his mother and stepfather and his grandmother. Nice old soul, but you have to think for her.â€™ Lily looked as though she had been thinking for her whole family all her life; she was younger, by far, than she appeared. â€˜Didn't he have anyone closer?â€™ â€˜Not that were any good to him. He was born out of wedlock.â€™ She used the old phrase. â€˜His real father's in the Merchant Navy, and when we'll see him next, I couldn't say. Off the coast of West Africa when I last heard from him, and that wasn't so very recent. As for his motherâ€¦â€™ She shrugged. â€˜Here today and gone tomorrow, that one. Moved in with a boy that's  got a group. Then they got married. So there's a kind of stepfather.â€™ She made it sound like a disease. She had the casserole lid off and was stirring its contents. â€˜Lot of them around at the moment.â€™ He took the spoon out of her hand and laid it on the table. â€˜And what about Steve Hilaire? Is he a sharp one growing up bad?â€™ Lily put the lid on the casserole, and the casserole in the oven. She shrugged. â€˜You spoke to him,â€™ Coffin reminded her. â€˜Have you spoken to him?â€™ Coffin shook his head. â€˜Perhaps you should. Try it for yourself, see where it gets you. Have a try. I had to speak to him, to find out what he knew about Ephraim; after all, he had Ephraim's boots.â€™ â€˜And?â€™ â€˜He makes me angry.â€™ â€˜How is that?â€™ â€˜He won't answer questions. None of my Why questions. Nor How. Just didn't answer. Or couldn't.â€™ â€˜He seemed to be talking.â€™ Lily gave him a look telling of her own sharpness. â€˜Oh, you saw that, did you? Pity you can't lip-read.â€™ Coffin had often thought the same himself. â€˜He was talking. But there's talking and saying. He wasn't saying. He talked about nothing.â€™ â€˜Absolutely nothing?â€™ â€˜He talked about himself. That was nothing to me. I wanted to know when he'd last seen Ephraim. Where he'd last seen him. What they'd done together. The places they went to. Were they true  friends? And why?â€™ She shook her head. â€˜Nothing. He didn't know. Or couldn't remember. But about himself he practically told me what he had for breakfast. I'd like to be a policeman, he said. Or if not a policeman, then a doctor.â€™ â€˜I wonder why.â€™ â€˜So he could make trouble for people,â€™ said Lily sourly. â€˜Is that really you talking, Lily Bates? Saying these things?â€™ There were angry tears in Lily's eyes. â€˜I used to like the little beggar. Time was when he was always around my house with Ephraim. I thought they were pals, real pals. I knew he kept it from his mother. I suppose I ought to have realized that if a boy could do that, then he wouldn't be open with anyone else. I wish I hadn't spoken to him now.â€™ â€˜You'd have done better to leave him alone.â€™ â€˜I wanted to know for myself, hard and clear, with my own ears what he knew about Ephraim.â€™ Coffin said, â€˜I think you took a risk, talking to him in the park.â€™ He did not amplify nor did Lily ask the nature of that risk, but it was a comment he profoundly believed, an emotion rather than a rational thought. He was working on it. But what he seemed to be sensing was that the boy was dangerous. Somehow or the other, he was not sure how, she had dished him out a plate of stew and he was sitting eating it. The kitchen was a homely, comfortable room. Everything that could be polished was polished, but  nothing was new, all the furniture and equipment settled into their accustomed places as of long habit. It was cosy. I'm setting Lily in her context, Coffin thought. And Ephraim too. These are ordinary people. Steve and Rose are not ordinary people. â€˜What did they do together? Any idea at all?â€™ He was trying to get a picture of the life that Steve and Ephraim had had together. From that life seemed to have come death. â€˜Oh, they were always out. Away and off together. But I didn't know where. You know lads. But they often came back here for their tea.â€™ Rose, her tone implied, was a poor cook and a worse mother. â€˜And they'd talk? So you knew what they got up to?â€™ â€˜Not lately. Not the last year. Shut down, they both did.â€™ â€˜And that worried you?â€™ â€˜Yes. It did. But just lately â€”â€™ she hesitated' â€” just lately, I've wondered if Steve ever gave much away.â€™ Once again she hesitated. â€˜He's a manager. He can pull strings.â€™ â€˜Manipulative, you mean?â€™ The word was alien to her and she looked doubtful. â€˜If you say so.â€™ â€˜Thanks for telling me all this; it's what I wanted to know.â€™ â€˜You're a nice young man. I wouldn't talk to everyone like I've talked to you.â€™ â€˜I know that, Mrs Bates.â€™ â€˜He saw too much of old Mosse. That house, it was a disgrace. Attracted the dregs.â€™ â€˜Yes. And I wanted to know about that too.â€™ â€˜A disgrace. He let himself and the house go. I hope you'll be happy in it.â€™ â€˜I shall try to be,â€™ said Coffin soberly. If he got the chance. Lily saw him to the front door. â€˜They were only kids,â€™ she said despairingly. â€˜Only kids,â€™ said Coffin. â€˜Steve still is.â€™ But a kid with Uncle Mosse and his house in his background, a house in which murder had been done. Uncle Mosse, retired eccentric, and a house in Mouncy Street; genetics and environment, the two strands in making a person. And you had to take Rose Hilaire into the equation. She came into it, mercilessly when he had heard what Gabriel had to say. Seven It was a warm evening. Suddenly and unseasonably warm. Coffin found it hard to tuck into Mrs Lorimer's cold beef and salad after having eaten Lily Bates's stew. Nor did he fancy it greatly; after some years away from Mrs Lorimer's hotel and of looking after himself, eating exactly what he liked, it was hard to get used to her iron hand with a potato. All over Greenwich and down into Deptford and along in Woolwich, people were protesting at the sudden heat. It was unnatural, they said, hot days ought to start gradually, beginning with dawn, but this one had hit them suddenly between four and five in the afternoon. By six-thirty it was hot, with the temperature still rising. For some unexplained reason many housewives had cooked beef in one form or another that night and Coffin was probably lucky to find his second supper was cold, for all over South London people were pushing their plates back. â€˜And what are you doing this evening?â€™ asked Mrs Lorimer. She was virtually retired these days, her hotel (where Coffin had once lived) turned into small flats over whose tenants she kept a stern eye. A favoured few like John Coffin could still be housed en pension, as it were. It was because of the overpowering force of this favouritism that he had chosen to  move elsewhere, making the demands of his job the pretext. â€˜I'm going to my evening class.â€™ â€˜Oh, which one? German, or the other one? â€˜The family history one.â€™ He could have lied, but he usually found himself speaking the truth to Mrs Lorimer; it was another reason for moving out. â€˜Still intent on finding your lost brother?â€™ She shook her head. â€˜A waste of time.â€™ â€˜I don't think so. And I enjoy it.â€™ He did. If he hadn't been a detective he might have been a historian. Indeed, there was a sense in which he was a historian: he loved investigating source material, going back to the originals, and patiently fitting one piece of evidence into the pattern with another. â€˜It's the girl that teaches the class: the one with red hair.â€™ â€˜No, it isn't.â€™ Another thing she disapproved of was his passionate interest in the other sex. But he did like the young woman, a hoyden from Somerville who gambled on the horses and was always broke. â€˜All right, what are you doing this week?â€™ It was a challenge; not for nothing had Mrs Lorimer been a formidable ARP warden in the war, and later a JP. â€˜Parish registers. And I've done my homework.â€™ She leaned forward. â€˜Mark my words, no good will come of it.â€™ Then she relented: â€˜Have some apple tart?â€™ â€˜No, thank you.â€™ Her iron hand was even harder on the pastry, and affected its colour as well so that it looked dark and oppressed. â€˜Too hot.â€™ â€˜I know what's the matter with you: those dead boys. â€˜Not my case,â€™ he muttered. â€˜No. But your house. And you can't stop thinking about it.â€™ Well, that was true enough. â€˜And you mind, reminds you of that other case.â€™ At the beginning of his career, a friend of young John Coffin's had been a multiple murderer, and he had learnt something of their nature. They were a strange breed, these killers who might or might not know their victims, but for whom the victim filled a need. Between victim and murderer there was a match, too; they slotted into position in each other 's lives like template and pattern. Other things he knew as well, and meant to look out for. Like the shadow such killers cast on others. â€˜Do you ever hear from Stella Pinero?â€™ He had fallen in love too at that time. He shook his head. â€˜No.â€™ That was in character: Stella did not look back. â€˜She's certainly done well,â€™ said Mrs Lorimer grudgingly. â€˜She's a good actress.â€™ Perhaps even a great one; he always went to see her perform. Thus aiding his education because Stella was stretching her powers in the classics: Hedda Gabler, Lady Macbeth, St Joan. â€˜You know Angel House is being turned into a Museum of the Theatre?â€™ He nodded silently. Of course he knew. Rachel Esthart, a famous actress of her day, and a patron of Stella Pinero's just as the then Chief Inspector  Dander had been of the young Coffin, had left her Greenwich house to Stella. â€˜Now there was an actress. Better than Stella, to my mind.â€™ â€˜Different.â€™ â€˜More heart. Shame she died so soon after that comeback.â€™ Mrs Lorimer was a keen student of the theatre and could swap phrases like â€˜comebackâ€™ and â€˜a turkeyâ€™and â€˜papering the houseâ€™with the best. â€˜Seemed as if she had that one last flare of light before she went out.â€™ Mrs Lorimer chewed her way through her own helping of apple tart. â€˜Oh, that reminds me. That other young woman rang up.â€™ â€˜What other one?â€™ â€˜The new one: Gabriel.â€™ â€˜Yes, not my new one.â€™ But he knew she would be if he could work it. â€˜What did she want?â€™ â€˜She wants to talk to you.â€™ Mrs Lorimer's eyebrows rose. â€˜We thought of better excuses in my day. You're to telephone her.â€™ They met, by arrangement, outside the entrance to the school where his evening class was held. With the inevitability of certain aspects of life, this was, of course, Hook Road School. â€˜Coming in?â€™ he said. A few drops of rain were falling from the overheated sky. â€˜I don't think so,â€™ Gabriel responded nervously. â€˜I went to this school myself.â€™ â€˜So did I.â€™ Another thing they had in common. Hook Road graduates, both. â€˜Let's walk up and down while I tell you.â€™ She was nervous as she handed out the story, but she told it vividly, her body unconsciously acting out the story so that he could almost see and hear Rose and Dagmar. Charley said I must tell you.â€™ â€˜Calm down, Gabriel.â€™ He put his arm round her thin shoulder. â€˜Nice scent you're wearing.â€™ â€˜It's a new one.â€™ She relaxed a little. â€˜American. They're making good scent now. Quite different from a French scent, isn't it?â€¦ So what do you think?â€™ Her voice rose. â€˜I think she's killed someone. Perhaps Ephraim. Or anyway, seen a killing.â€™ â€˜Seen a killing,â€™ repeated Coffin. â€˜Well, she could have done. Thought of asking?â€™ â€˜No!â€™ In the end, someone will, he thought. â€˜Why have you told me?â€™ â€˜You're a policeman.â€™ â€˜Not my case.â€™ That was going to be written on his heart. â€˜Still â€” I saw her in Mouncy Street one night,â€™ said Gabriel suddenly. â€˜I thought she was drunk. She was near your house, she sat on the wall.â€™ â€˜When was this?â€™ â€˜I can't be sure. But it could have been about the time Ephraim disappeared.â€™ â€˜Who else have you told? Just Charley. His grip on her arm tightened. â€˜Gaby, let me  explain something: this is a major case. A multiple murder case.â€™ A few heavy spots of rain were falling on the pavements like coins. â€˜A lot of people will be involved. There is an Investigating Officer â€” he's a kind of control figure; he has an Incident Room. But there is also a scene-of-the-crime officer, a photographer, a pathologist. Various forensic people, and probably a search team. That's a lot of people, Gaby, and I am not one of them.â€™ â€˜Stillâ€¦â€™ she said again. â€˜I am busy on my own work: I am part of a team, legging it around London, working undercover.â€™ Gently he said, â€˜So I've got other things on my mind, Gaby.â€™ Triumphantly she said, â€˜But I know.â€™ She corrected herself. â€˜We know that you've seen Lily. And you were seen talking to your pal Jordan who is on the case. We watch you, you know.â€™ She nodded. â€˜You are interested. We know.â€™ Coffin stared at her; her little face was excited and interested. Intent, was another word. It was at this moment, with a faint feeling that made the hair on his head prickle, that Coffin got the first intimation that even if it was not his case, he himself was in it. Right in it. We know, she'd said. Damn you, Gabriel, you've opened my eyes and no one enjoys that. He was seeing it all so differently from Gabriel; he was seeing it from the other side of the mirror. And he was looking at his own face. Of course Jordan was taking time off to talk to him, and of course he was observed, probably on all sides. It was his house. That investigating team he'd talked about, they were probably passionately interested in him. In the nicest possible way, of course. Young Coffin? Decent chap, this business can't be anything to do with him. Still, we'd better look. You bet. He wiped his forehead. Hot. Was it getting hotter? As the heat of the evening mounted, Rose Hilaire opened all the windows in her sitting-room to let air in. There was a lot of bad feeling floating around her house and by opening the windows she hoped to let it out. The smell that floated back from the river with its docks and factories was unpleasant, like her life at present. One chink of light had appeared, however: Steve was talking to her. Not a lot, not saying much, but offering observations voluntarily, as if there was a relationship between them. Not necessarily that of mother and son; Steve had detached himself from that hook and would never be hung on it again. Just as well, perhaps, but for Rose, not so easy. One tiny little fragment of her would always be a mother. But at last there was a kind of to and fro between them, more like a tennis match perhaps than a genuine  conversation, with words being patted back and forth, but Rose at least was grateful for it. She leaned out of the window, trying to enjoy the fresher air; a scent of burning rubber drifted in. To the west was a soap factory; she could smell that too. â€˜Good old Deller's,â€™ she murmured. Steve was sitting in front of the television set watching a pop show. â€˜What's that you're listening to?â€™ Ready, Steady, Go.â€™ Pretty Things.â€™ â€˜Noisy.â€™ â€˜I like them. Better than the Stones.â€™ â€˜I thought it was all the Beatles.â€™ â€˜Oh â€”â€™ he was dismissive' â€” wouldn't miss them.â€™ â€˜Time for you to go to bed.â€™ He got up almost at once without argument. In that kind of way he was never any trouble. It was good behaviour. Or, looked at from another point of view, it was most abnormal. â€˜Good night,â€™ she said to his back. From the back he looked just like anyone else. What she longed to ask him was: â€˜Have I ever been missing for any time, Steve? Been away and not come back when I should? Acted strange? Have I ever come back with blood on me?â€™ But these were questions you did not ask. Because he might say: â€˜Yes, Mum, once or twice you did. And I happen to know it was you that put Ephraim's boots in my bag.â€™ She sat back in her chair by the window and let the hot air play over her face. She relaxed and her mind ran free. Soon she felt a different person. Or the same person in another skin. The murderer came out and sniffed the air temporarily. Hot. There was something stimulating about the warmed air so heavy with the smells of living. For the murderer it summoned up memories of shared moments. These were valuable, photographs in an album. A black album. One or two anxieties came with the memories. A pity about the boy's boots. That was a mistake. Looked a good idea. Wasn't. The murderer thought about it, still finding it almost as amusing as it had seemed at the time; the murderer's sense of humour was childlike, adolescent at the best, but secretive. All the best jokes are private. A joke against authority that now didn't look so good. The trouble with being what you were was that although your judgement was impeccable, the rest of the world just didn't always know it. They would never know the utter thrill. It had been spicy, really rich, having the body â€˜at homeâ€™, as it were, over the holiday, when Belmodes was empty. The body at rest in the cupboard in the women's room. Then, before the holiday ended, removed, which involved a certain amount of dragging. It would be better to be stronger in the arms, help could be summoned, but some tasks one did on one's own. Leaving the pants in the cupboard was possibly a nothing, and picking up the reel of red thread in the boots simply accident, done goodness knows how. The world, of course, would look for plan and purpose here, not knowing how  much a creature of serendipity you were, not knowing, just doing. They'd learn. You were what you were, and the world would just have to learn. Rose woke up from her sleep (if it had been a true sleep) and stirred. She thought she could hear someone moving about. Or was it just noises in the skull? She had plenty of those too. â€˜Is that you, Steve?â€™ Silence. Eight It was not too hot to sleep: in Coffin's life it had never been too hot or too cold or too anything to find oblivion. Sleep always came to him easily and quickly, very often unexpectedly, burying him when he wasn't looking. Death would be like that for him, he always supposed. But tonight his thoughts were stamping around his mind wearing heavy boots. They were beating a clear path. The path towards Uncle Mosse of Mouncy Street. Turn which way you would, Edward Mosse, retired and dotty, and his house in Mouncy Street were always there, a kind of terrible citadel. He knew without doubt it was a path he was going to walk: the path to old Mossycop. The place was vital. Victims sought out their killers. Yes, that was acknowledged. You had to look for a pairing between murderer and victim. But places, too, sometimes cried out for their crime. The house in Mouncy Street had been such a place. He could see that now. Created so by Ted Mosse, lover of uniforms, not too honest, deceased. It was, after all, no real mistake that his body had been falsely identified as being there. Uncle Mosse  had wanted to be dead there, and since he couldn't achieve it for himself, his clothes had done it for him. There are no accidents in murder. It all comes about as deliberately, if unconsciously, contrived. Then Coffin thought: No, that's a bit fancy, boy. But he did have fancy thoughts sometimes, nor were they always wrong. A fancy thought popped into his mind then, handed to him by the tutor of his evening class. When you don't know where to begin your investigation about your family, she had said, start talking to the last generation back, then the one before if there are any survivors. They were there, raid their memories, make your start with them. Get in touch with the eldest living contacts, Marina Marsden had said, her big blue eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. No wonder her class loved her. He started with himself. I am the first living contact to consult, Coffin thought, lying back in his hard bed under Mrs Lorimer's roof. He began to assemble what he remembered about the house in Mouncy Street as he had first known it. Old Mosse saved three people from a burning house in the Blitz but was a thieving rat otherwise. Was he a grand old man or a proper perisher? Then, just for a moment, unpredictably, his unknown sibling was in the room with him. He had taken to doing this lately. His appearance varied. Sometimes he looked like John Coffin himself, sometimes he was more like what Coffin remembered of his mother, but he was always young. He was ageless. Sir James Barrie would have known him for a Lost Boy. He did not always have a voice, but he always had a point of view. â€˜You hardly knew old Mosse, remember,â€™ he now pointed out. â€˜He hardly left the house by the time you got round to him.â€™ They don't wear knickers in Paradise Street, they had said in Mouncy Street. But life had caught up with them. No one wore knickers any more. They wore tights, and what they wore underneath that no one had told Coffin. â€˜I'm going down Mouncy Street,â€™ he said to his sibling. â€˜And down Decimus Street and then to Paradise Street. I'm going to ask all the old â€˜uns.â€™ If there were any left. But there were. When he had one of these fancy feelings he was never entirely wrong. He had always liked Decimus Street, it was a decent little street without the glamour of being wicked like Paradise Street. Mouncy Street and Decimus Street and Paradise Street formed three sides of a square with all the backyards running together. The fourth side of the square was occupied by a gas-works whose gasometer looked down on its neighbours. During the war it had been a dangerous neighbour, but no bomb had fallen on it, although fire-bombs had spattered all over Mouncy Street and Decimus Street. The inhabitants were used to the smell, which mixed in nicely with the odours from Deller's soap factory and the mingled scents from the river. It was a homely smell, they hardly noticed it. The smell was as familiar to Coffin as anyone else. One of those things you forget about when away, then meet with surprised pleasure on a return. Now he fancied himself a connoisseur of the smell, able to distinguish between its elements. Mouncy Street had more of the river in its atmosphere, Decimus Street more of the gasometer, while Paradise Street, as was to be expected, was altogether richer and racier on account of the cats'-meat man who boiled up his ware in an old stable in the road. He had survived two world wars and a slump. There was never any shortage of cats in the neighbourhood; they too added their smell to the back gardens. No one took any notice of him when he arrived back in Mouncy Street. He was not yet known as a neighbour. His own house, at which he looked wistfully, was still in the control of his colleagues. Was it his fancy that he saw Phil Jordan staring at him morosely through an upper window? He knew he must still be an object of some interest. But his time was his own; he was off duty. He knew that the investigation into the deaths of the young boys was proceeding slowly but methodically, building up a picture. All the boys had died by strangling. Not manual strangulation: a lead had been drawn sharply round the neck in each case. No. 30 Mouncy Street was his first stop because he knew already from his own observation that here lived a truly old inhabitant; Mary Adelaide Flock, who had been born twenty years before Queen Victoria died and did not count herself old yet. â€˜A proper old duckâ€™, she was known as locally, but she was a duck who had somehow acquired a set of sharp teeth with a bite. Coffin had wondered how to introduce himself, but there was no need. She leaned out of her front bay-window and gave him a shout. â€˜Let yourself in; the door's on the latch.â€™ She was a large woman, wearing a blue cotton dress with two woollen cardigans, one white, and one red, on top of each other, although the weather was still hot. She sat squarely in a big armchair and looked at him. The room was crowded with furniture. At her elbow was a small round table bearing a tea-tray. â€˜I thought you'd be along to see me.â€™ â€˜Did you?â€™ He was surprised. â€˜Everyone always comes to see me. I've lost the use of my legs, you see, and can't get out. You've heard of me, I expect.â€™ â€˜Well, I had,â€™ he admitted. â€˜And I know who you are. And what you are. So that makes us equal. Crippled I may be, but I've got my eyes and ears.â€™ â€˜And your wits,â€™ he said admiringly. â€˜So why have I come? Apart from wanting to meet a neighbour, Mrs Flock.â€™ â€˜You can call me Mary, most people do.â€™ â€˜Mary, then.â€™ â€˜So you plan to stay on, do you?â€™ she said with interest. â€˜I thought you'd be moving away now.â€™ â€˜I shall stay if I can. Not sure about that yet. I may not be able to stomach it.â€™ He was surprised to hear  his voice saying that, he hadn't known until that moment. â€˜But it's about the house I want to talk.â€™ â€˜And who's to blame you.â€™ She motioned towards the tea-table. â€˜Pour me out a cup of tea, please.â€™ And as he started to do so, â€˜Take one yourself, will you?â€™ There was a Hanoverian command to her voice, not particularly feminine, but full of authority. â€˜Not for me, thank you.â€™ She stirred her tea. â€˜You've been talking to Lily Bates.â€™ â€˜She told you?â€™ â€˜Not directly, but I heard. I do hear things. So who told you what a useful person that old gossip Mary Flock was? Was it Lily?â€™ â€˜The man in the chemist's shop.â€™ He had provided a short list of his oldest customers. There was another in Decimus Street and yet another in Paradise Street. â€˜Ah, him.â€™ She appeared to digest this fact. â€˜Well, I haven't known him as long as some. So what is it you want to know?â€™ â€˜For how long did Ted Mosse live in Mouncy Street?â€™ â€˜All his married life.â€™ â€˜So you knew him well?â€™ â€˜I knew Freda Mosse better. A nice little woman.â€™ â€˜And her husband was not nice?â€™ â€˜I'm not saying that.â€™ She sipped her tea with pleasure, nodding again towards the tea-tray. â€˜Sure you won't? No, well he was a bit of a public figure, see, and people like us don't care for that.â€™ Coffin pressed her. â€˜But then he retired. Stopped being a public face.â€™ â€˜He never retired from what he was,â€™ she said bluntly. â€˜Called him a proper bastard in Paradise Street.â€™ It was true that Ted Mosse had turned out not to be too honest, even in his best uniformed days, had run various little corruptions and been found out, but it did not seem the sort of bad behaviour that would have worried most of working-class South London. Or not much. â€˜He wasn't so bad,â€™ Coffin protested. â€˜And then he was a brave man. I heard he saved a whole family during the Blitz.â€™ Her tea was getting a vigorous stirring, so that it swirled around the cup. â€˜I was away during the war. Evacuated. I was doing my war work making aeroplanes. Beating old Adolf.â€™ â€˜What about when you came back?â€™ â€˜All I know is that I left Freda a jolly-looking woman and when I came back she was altered. From then it was downhill all the way. Cancer. I blame him. I think Freda did too.â€™ She hadn't told him much except that she did not like her neighbour Fireman Mosse and blamed him for the death of his wife. â€˜So you can't tell me much?â€™ â€˜I don't know what you're after,â€™ she said. â€˜I don't reckon you know yourself. There's been death in that house, but old Ted Mosse is dead himself â€” I knew him and Freda when they was married, what he was before that I can't say. He came from Paradise Street. I was Mouncy Street. We didn't mix much. Ask his niece. Ask her.â€™ Doesn't like Rose Hilaire, he thought. â€˜Didn't have any children, did they?â€™ Dead silence. She put her cup down. â€˜See yourself out,â€™ she said. â€˜You know the way.â€™ As he walked back into the hot street he wondered if some royal bastard did indeed lurk in her family tree. The sons of George III had been prodigal breeders, hadn't they? You had to explain that profile and that manner somehow. Although it was so hot the sky was grey and low, not an evening to raise the spirits. As he walked on down Mouncy Street and into Decimus Street he could almost feel the curious eyes of Phil Jordan on his back. He swung round. No one there, all his imagination. Not another appearance of his unknown sibling, it felt quite different, in any case that creature was very, very private, only appearing when they were alone. No. 5 Decimus Street was his next address. According to the sociable chemist, here dwelt an elderly man with many ailments and a prodigious memory. Don't believe everything he says, mind, but he claims to have lived in the same house all his life. Arthur Ford was a tiny, wry little man who appeared silently behind his front door as Coffin banged on the knocker. â€˜Hello, are you the man from the Social?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜Then you're the man from the Sally Army about the soup plates?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ He had thought about what to say, not everyone  was going to be as easy to approach as Mrs Flock. â€˜I'm moving into Mouncy Street. I bought Ted Mosse's house, and now I'm wondering what sort of man he was. Worries me, I've got to live in the house.â€™ â€˜Well, it would.â€™ â€˜You knew him. I'm told so.â€™ â€˜Oh yes, poor old fellow.â€™ Suddenly it was a new picture of Ted Mosse being presented. Now he was a â€˜poor old fellowâ€™. â€˜Come on in, I never mind a chat.â€™ Arthur retreated inside the house, motioning Coffin to follow. He was a good deal younger than Mary Adelaide Flock, and probably a lot younger still than the late Ted Mosse, but a limp suggested rheumatism and the reason he was known to the chemist. He led Coffin to a bright back kitchen, furnished in the most modern style, with new canary-yellow paint. A bird to match sang in a cage in the window, noisily saluting the room. â€˜Shut up, Daisy girl.â€™ He banged on the cage. â€˜We are both a bit deaf so you'll have to talk up.â€™ He sat down on a hard kitchen chair and stared hopefully up at Coffin. â€˜Ted Mosse, was it now? I used to take Meals on Wheels to him when he got past caring for himself.â€™ â€˜You didn't know him earlier?â€™ â€˜No, I didn't. I was night work, till I retired. But you could ask Mother. She's only upstairs.â€™ Picking up his stick, he banged three times on the ceiling. â€˜That'll fetch her.â€™ A bumping and creaking down the stairs announced the arrival of Mrs Ford, who was younger and taller  than her husband but just as friendly. She was wearing denim overalls and carrying a bucket and brush. â€˜It's turned out a beautiful blue, love. Not too bright at all, I put just that bit of white in like you said and it's coming on lovely. I wonder if we could afford a blue bath?â€™ Then she saw Coffin. â€˜Hello, dear. Have you come about the Darby and Joan party?â€™ The bird answered her with a burst of violent song. â€˜Be quiet, Daisy. I don't think I can play for the dancing this year. But they've got a lovely lot of dance records. Victor Silvester, the lot. Use them, dear, that's what I say. â€˜He wants to talk to you about Ted Mosse,â€™ said her husband. â€˜Nothing to do with Darby and Joan.â€™ Her eyes lit up with understanding. â€˜Oh, don't I know you? You bought the house from Rose Hilaire. I've seen you with Gabriel. Another chap with a uniform in that house.â€™ True enough, although he hadn't realized it so clearly before, that house did attract uniforms one way and another. There were policemen all over it now. But people took houses, not houses people. Surely? â€˜I'm plainclothes,â€™ he said mildly. She moved across the kitchen to the stove and put on a kettle: tea-time again. â€˜So it's old Ted?â€™ â€˜Yes. How well did you know him? What sort was he?â€™ â€˜You policemen are all the same. Do they issue you with a set of questions to ask when you train? What sort of a question is that? I'm not God. Ask one of  your lot. He seemed to know enough policemen at one time. Fancied the uniform, I always thought.â€™ â€˜They've got short memories.â€™ â€˜Long for what suits them. Wouldn't want to remember when he was once a friend, I suppose. Not when you think of what he ended up.â€™ â€˜Exactly.â€™ And what I'm looking for, Coffin thought, is what they might not remember, the little details, the sequence of small events that might shift Ted Mosse into a different perspective. I am a fly on the face of the Almighty, crawling over the surface to see what's what. He had expressed a similar thought to a neurologist friend of his once, to receive an alarmed look in reply. It was, clearly, a sinister symptom. He scratched his nose thoughtfully. â€˜He was a poor old thing when he died,â€™ said Mrs Ford. â€˜Couldn't do a thing. Shouldn't have been left on his own, but that's Rose Hilaire for you. He was kind to her as a kid. Kind to all kids. Had time for them. He'd take the boys to football matches. Once took all us little â€˜uns in Paradise Street to the Woolwich panto.â€™ â€˜He kept in with youngsters to the end, didn't he?â€™ After all, several had been found dead in his house. There was a second's silence. â€˜I suppose they knew it was a friendly house.â€™ Arthur spoke entirely without irony, although he was clearly aware that it was so friendly to some, so open-armed, that they never left it. â€˜Never had a child themselves, did they?â€™ Mrs Ford said primly, â€˜I never got to know them well in their child-bearing years.â€™ She picked up her paint brush. â€˜I'm off to work again.â€™ She was off up the stairs without another word. On the way out old Ford said, â€˜Don't take any notice of my wife. She was brought up very nicely and she doesn't like to see bad in anyone. There's good in everyone, she always says, and so there is.â€™ He nodded his head vigorously. â€˜You find what you look for.â€™ Coffin waited. He hoped you did. From the room above he could hear Daisy bursting into vigorous song. â€˜Ted did like children and youngsters. They both did. But his wife now, she liked them in a motherly kind of way. No fuss, no display, but you could see she did. With Ted it was different.â€™ He hesitated, seeking the right word. â€˜It was a sort of excitement to him.â€™ He looked at Coffin with large, pale, expectant eyes. He had delivered his little message well. â€˜I'm sweating,â€™ said Coffin. Out of Decimus Street, and round the corner into Paradise Street, and immediately he was back in his childhood, eight years old and with itchy feet. Until this moment he hadn't remembered that he had actually been here before. It was a fabled street, but for him it had been forbidden territory. But now he could smell and feel the past of that boy. He had been here before, and on a hot afternoon. Did he remember cricket with a bat from Woolworth's and the wicket marked in chalk on that brick wall? There  had been a barrel-organ playing then, he was sure of it. No barrel-organ now, but pop music bouncing from a transistor through an open window. He walked slowly down the pavements. No front gardens in Paradise Street; the flat-faced little houses fronted straight on to the road. He knew well that you opened the front door to walk into the kitchen. In the old days, Grandma was usually propped up on an upright chair and sat in the open door to enjoy the street scene. All day. A few doors were open tonight, but he couldn't see any old â€˜uns. He was looking for Brenda Blond. He had heard the name Blond, Dagmar, through Gabriel and stored it in the back of his mind. Dagmar was a friend of Rose Hilaire's. Blond didn't sound like a Paradise Street name, especially with Dagmar thrown in. Surely they had all been Blackers, or Tickles or Sprotts. Or those that got to Hook Road School. Of course, there were always the others who never went to school, who never declared themselves, but lived out their lives very privately, avoiding the school officer, the rent man, the army, and sometimes even prison. The two elements, those who more or less kept the rules and those who never tried, had always lived side by side in Paradise Street. Old Eddie Mosse had been a strange man to come out of Paradise Street. And yet perhaps not, because the more you looked at Mosse the odder he became. What he was looking at was not a murderer, but a  man at the roots of murder. A man who attracted crime. Who perhaps found it attractive. A beautiful metallic green sports car was parked at the kerb. A rich car for Paradise Street; he looked at it curiously, noting the number automatically. There was a boy sitting in the car. A fair-haired, beautiful boy. A yard in front of him a door opened smartly and two women emerged; both made for the car. If they saw him, he was of no significance. â€˜Rose, don't be too upset. You're going to end up lucky, I can feel it.â€™ â€˜I'm going to kill him.â€™ â€˜No, Rose, not even in joke do you say that.â€™ â€˜He let me down.â€™ She was looking directly at Coffin now, but was not seeing him. â€˜Men always do let you down.â€™ The authentic voice of Paradise Street talking. Rose Hilaire had observed Coffin properly now, and knew what she was seeing. â€˜I told you from the beginning that Joe Landau was no good for you. But at least he didn't get you pregnant. And it's all imagination, this â€”â€™ â€˜Dagmar, shut up.â€™ The fierce note in Rose Hilaire's voice got through to Dagmar Blond, who stopped talking at once, but the last phrase on her lips came out like a ghost: â€˜seeing yourself kill â€”â€™ The last word of all disappeared. Rose turned to Coffin. â€˜What do you want? Is it about the house? You bought it, didn't you?â€™ They hadn't met but her intelligence service was obviously sharper than Coffin's own. He answered the first question. â€˜I came looking for Brenda Blond.â€™ Rose looked at Dagmar. â€˜My mother,â€™ said Dagmar in surprise. â€˜Why her? Anyway, you can't, she's ill.â€™ â€˜What is it you wanted?â€™ Rose was still aggressive, hostile; she knew Coffin had overheard their conversation. â€˜I've seen you with Gabriel, haven't I?â€™ â€˜That little bitch,â€™ said Dagmar. â€˜I told you she was trouble.â€™ â€˜Gabriel is no trouble to me. I've settled with her; she knows her place,â€™ Rose said over her shoulder, not taking her eyes off Coffin's face. He too was staring at her. Hitherto he had only visualized her through Gabriel's eyes, and he saw now that his little friend was not an accurate describer. Rose, vibrant with barely suppressed anger, was the most striking woman he had ever seen. She was younger than he had believed, older than he was, but not by much. She was also pretty; Gabriel hadn't let that out, either. Gabriel had the unconventional good looks of her generation, high cheekbones with a wide mouth and slightly slanting green eyes, another period might have called her plain. But Rose's looks went back to an earlier time with big, wide eyes and strong yet delicate profile. Perforce Coffin knew a good deal about her. He knew she was a highly successful businesswoman with, according to Gabriel, no real flair for fashion but a keen eye on the market-place. He knew she had a failed marriage with a strange son, Steve. He knew that she had been the owner of a house in which murder had been effected; he knew that she had inherited this house from her uncle, Ted Mosse, an old man who was himself worth investigating. A man who was called an enigma in Mouncy Street, a poor old fellow in Decimus Street, and a proper bastard in Paradise Street. A man who loved children, or anyway, was interested in them, but had none himself. He knew too that she had a lover called Joe Landau by whom she was not pregnant. And last of all he knew she believed herself capable of murder. What she knew of him, he could only guess at. â€˜I came asking about Ted Mosse,â€™ he said diffidently. â€˜He was a proper bastard, and a rotten influence and I hated him.â€™ The words exploded in the air, he could almost feel them bounce. Before he could answer, Rose got into her car, banged the door and was away. After a few feet, she stopped, and thrust a hand through the window at him. â€˜Here, here's my card. I owe you something for selling you the house. Come over and I'll tell you something.â€™ Nine He went to her straight away; the mood Rose was in he would get more out of her, and the mood he was in he wanted it. But he had a problem: the card she had so rapidly thrust into his hand was her business card, no home address, just Belmodes, Mouncy Street, which he knew but where he did not want to wait to visit. Tonight was the time. On the corner of Mouncy Street was a telephone-box. From inside, he could keep an eye on his own house where nothing much seemed to be happening. Almost it appeared empty, deserted even by the police, but he doubted that this was so, there were probably men inside at this very minute. He wondered if he could get them to pay the mortgage. Hopefully, he looked first for Rose Hilaire in the telephone book; no such name, so she must be ex-directory. So he dialled Gabriel's number. â€˜Gaby? It's John.â€™ She interrupted him. â€˜Oh, I know who it is. I recognized your voice.â€™ Behind her voice, he could hear music, pop of some sort, he didn't recognize the group, but he could hear the beat banging away. He thought she had someone with her. She said something he could not hear and the music ceased. She  listened to what he wanted. â€˜Rose's address? Well, I know it, of course.â€™ She sounded doubtful. â€˜Come on, then.â€™ â€˜She lives in Riverwalk, Greenwich; a new block of flats looking on the river. I don't know the number.â€™ â€˜I'll find it.â€™ â€˜You'll probably see her car parked. She loves to leave it flashing around.â€™ There was mild spite in Gabriel's voice. â€˜I'll find her.â€™ He put the receiver down, calling a relaxed, â€˜Thanks,â€™ into the air. â€˜Oh, change the record.â€™ Gabriel went back into the room. â€˜He's going after her,â€™ she said to Charley. â€˜Ah.â€™ Charley considered. â€˜Well, we don't mind, do we?â€™ â€˜Sometimes you are very stupid, Charley. I have got to know him: he would not go round there unless she had given the all clear.â€™ â€˜He's a policeman.â€™ â€˜It's not his case.â€™ â€˜I'm not the stupid one,â€™ observed Charley mildly. â€˜You are. You think he's your property.â€™ He spoke with the gentle cruelty he could show towards his models and which made some of them call him Charley the Knife. But Gabriel would not be stopped. â€˜You know what she's going to tell him: that she has this dream, fantasy, God knows what it is, that she killed one of the kids.â€™ Perhaps all of them, Rose had not been specific, or Gabriel had not heard the details. â€˜She feels her hands doing it.â€™ â€˜Is that what she thinks?â€™ Charley hadn't heard the story before. â€˜Poor soul. But why do you care? You want her out of the way?â€™ â€˜He'll be on her side, she'll get him on her side. And I like him, Charley. I like him a lot.â€™ He put his arm around her and drew her towards him. â€˜Oh, come on, baby girl, calm down.â€™ Gabriel occupied a very special place in his life and he wanted her to stay there. He reached out a hand to switch the music on again. â€˜Come on, now, is this the girl that sat down next to Bertrand Russell outside the Ministry of Defence and wouldn't pay her fine, but sang a Bob Dylan at them?â€™ A plaintive Beatles love song poured all over them proclaiming that you couldn't buy love. â€˜No one 's as kind as you are, Charley.â€™ â€˜I'm a master of disguise,â€™ he joked. â€˜Oh, I know she'll eat him up.â€™ In a dry little voice, Charley said: â€˜Look on the bright side, perhaps he'll do the eating.â€™ He patted her head. â€˜This thing you heard her say â€” you really did hear it? Not a little fantasy of your own?â€™ Gabriel made an inarticulate noise and buried her head in his shoulder. He gave her a little shake. â€˜Come on now, did you?â€™ Gaby muttered something which he could not hear but whose message he got. â€˜All right then, you did.â€™ The music swept all around them. â€˜But what does it mean? Sounds odd to me.â€™ He stared over Gabriel's head. What was it Rose Hilaire saw, and how was it seen? Pictures seen on a  wall, shadow-play? Things in the dark, moving shapes with no faces? He could see them himself, for that matter, but he wondered how she could. Rose had calmed down a little, but not much. Her flat was on the third floor with its windows looking towards the river. He walked up the stairs, feeling the heat. The treads were covered with a kind of rubber and very quiet. Behind him the heat was building up to a storm, the sky was thick with it already. A flash of lightning flicked across the window. â€˜If I'd known you were going to be so quick I'd have given you a lift.â€™ She stood aside, silently offering him entrance. â€˜Still, it's just as well. In a minute I might have decided not to talk.â€™ As he knew. â€˜Since I know who you are and you obviously know me, there's no need for introductions. You are not my friend and I am not your friend, but I owe you something.â€™ â€˜So you said.â€™ And he'd come to collect. A debt you didn't know you had was best not argued with. Another flash lit up the sky. A bank of windows lined one wall of the big living-room, illuminating a style of house decoration that life at Mrs Lorimer's had not shown him. The floor was covered in thick creamy carpet on which stood squat, natural leather chairs. A big, unframed abstract hung on one wall, its colours echoing the cream and tan of the rest of the room. Facing that wall was a picture of a huge hand pointing a gun directly at you. Coffin couldn't take his eyes off it. He thought she was too sophisticated not to know what she had there, but he was surprised all the same. He dragged his gaze away from the giant phallic symbol. â€˜No thunder. Did you notice?â€™ Rose went to one of the windows and threw it open. â€˜The storm's a long way off yet.â€™ No sign of the boy with the lost angel face. â€˜But when it does come you won't want the window open.â€™ He could see the dark bank of clouds, feel the rising wind. â€˜I can close it.â€™ Rose gave a little shiver as the wind flicked at her bare arms. That summer, scoop necks and arms bare to the shoulders were what every woman wore, with hair loose, or caught in a gleaming beehive. It was the look, leggy, youthful and sexy. Rose did it well; she was just young enough to get away with it. Gabriel was really young, but Rose could pretend with the best. â€˜You can always dress ten years younger than your age,â€™ she told her customers, and she believed it. The lad Steve came into the room, silently like a little cat; he was wearing a dressing-gown and pyjamas as if he had started to go to bed, but decided against. Coffin noticed that his clothes, like his mother's, were expensive and beautiful; the boy wore them well, as if looking good was second nature to him. He smiled at Coffin, but ignored his mother. Protectively and fondly, she said, â€˜Don't worry about the storm, dear, it's a long way off.â€™ She moved, placing herself where he had to look at her, Coffin was embarrassed for her. â€˜But it's coming.â€™ He had an unexpectedly deep voice, as if maturity was not so far off. With neat skill he had managed to direct the words as much at Coffin as his mother. Coffin did not smile back; he did not like the feeling he was being manipulated. Instead he looked towards Rose. â€˜Our talk?â€™ he said. Let the boy pull his mother's strings if he liked. Then he was shocked by his own immediate antagonism to the boy. Something nasty here, he thought, and is it him or me? â€˜Go back to bed, Steve. Close the curtains and play some music. Then you won't hear the storm.â€™ â€˜Can't I stay?â€™ Rose looked at Coffin. â€˜No.â€™ â€˜So you're going to talk about me?â€™ â€˜No. Go to bed.â€™ Coffin walked across the room, laid his arm round the boy's shoulders. He did it quietly, but with weight. The action looked gentle to Rose, but Steve felt the force. Which was how Coffin meant it to be. He was not pleased with himself for his behaviour, but it worked. Steve left the room. Only at the door did he give Coffin a look of such sharp comprehension that any triumph he felt evaporated at once. â€˜Thanks. But I shouldn't have let you do that.â€™ â€˜No?â€™ â€˜I should have done it for myself.â€™ â€˜He's at a difficult age.â€™ He did not exactly believe this statement: to his mind Steve was not developing, he was already fully what he had it in him to be. People like Steve are the origin of the myths about changelings. â€˜He was hard as a baby,â€™ said Rose, confirming this thought. She went over to a side table. â€˜Have a drink, will you? I'm going to. Gin, whisky? I've got vodka. I think it's the sort of evening for vodka.â€™ â€˜Nothing, thank you.â€™ â€˜Oh come, you're not on duty. Anyway, you don't have to act with me â€” I'm Paradise Street, remember, we know all about what you police do or don't do, and most of them drink.â€™ â€˜Vodka, then.â€™ He watched her pour it with a steady hand. In spite of her anger, still bubbling away inside her, she was keeping a kind of control. â€˜Of course he was quite right. Steve's nearly always right.â€™ They are, Coffin thought; people like Steve are nearly always right. Deep down, they know. It's one of the things that made them different. â€˜It's about the house, and Uncle Mosse, and Steve. I kept him away from Uncle Mosse, but some people seem to fly together, don't they, and you can't keep them apart.â€™ Rose looked at him. â€˜I expect you thought you got a good buy in that house.â€™ â€˜At the time. â€˜I let it go cheap. I wanted it to go. Be rid of it. It had been empty nearly two years. Since the old man. I thought no one would buy. He'd let it run down. No one local would buy.â€™ â€˜No?â€™ â€˜Know what it was known as? The Mad House. That's it. You heard right: The Mad House.â€™ Coffin digested this information. It rang true, it was a mad house, he had felt it himself. No doubt everyone in Mouncy Street knew what he had bought and had been looking or waiting for him to find out. But it was one more fact to add to the picture of Ted Mosse, that ambiguous figure who was heavily disliked in one street, a doubtful â€˜poor old fellowâ€™ in another, and more or less mistrusted in all three. Now his old home was The Mad House. â€˜Why was it called that? It's not an obvious name. I know the old boy was senile. Not mad, though, more oblivious from what I'd heard.â€™ And yet the house had a spiritual entity that seemed to surpass its physical one. Rose did not answer him directly. â€˜I heard you asking about Uncle Mosse. I don't know why you wanted to know about him but I'll tell you. He was never very nice when he was alive and he seems to have got worse now that he's dead. A real bad influence.â€™ Coffin remembered a huge, red-faced man with a jolly, slightly too general smile. It wasn't specially for you his smile, just around you and about you. â€˜I can't remember much. Met him years ago.â€™ â€˜Oh, you'd be out of his age group. He liked 'em young. Younger than you.â€™ I was young then, thought Coffin, but obviously not young enough. â€˜I know he liked young people. Had them around. Everyone says so. Pity he never had any of his own.â€™ â€˜The reason he never had any was that his tastes precluded it,â€™ said Rose, spitting out the words. â€˜Except for one or two episodes that I suppose he couldn't miss, just to try, there was never a chance. And don't say he was married.â€™ Coffin was silent. One or two comments made in Mouncy Street and Decimus Street now meant something. â€˜Opinions are changing on that line,â€™ he said gently. â€˜You know there was a bill before Parliament. Only the General Election stopped it going through. It will next time.â€™ He was trying to ease her pain. Unsuccessfully. â€˜You don't understand. Perhaps he was harmless enough when he was younger, although I doubt that. He had a kind of shoe fetish â€” always giving the kids he fancied shoes, one we all knew in Paradise Street, but no one ever said. I suppose we didn't know the word fetish.â€™ She gave a little laugh. â€˜Hang around Paradise Street and you'd learn everything in the end, even if you didn't know the name.â€™ The vodka and her anger were combining to free her tongue. Coffin looked at her with sympathy. He liked her even more, vulnerable and dishevelled. â€˜So what I'm working up to telling you is that when he got silly he let anyone in that house. It was used, no other word for it. Anyone could drift in and plenty did. That's why it was called The Mad House. Mad things, bad things, anything went there. He knew. Or didn't know.â€™ Coffin looked at her. â€˜Well, thanks for telling me.â€™ â€˜And it went on after he was dead. Plenty used that house. I knew that when I sold it to you.â€™ â€˜I could see it was in a bad state.â€™ It was the process of repair and re-decoration that had uncovered the bodies. â€˜I was going to tell you to change the locks.â€™ â€˜Thanks. I'll attend to it.â€™ He couldn't keep the dryness out of his voice. â€˜You're angry.â€™ â€˜No. â€˜Yes, you are. And because you are, and because I like you, I'm going to tell you something else: that was The Mad House. Now there's a new place. I don't know where but it exists. I think it must. Somewhere.â€™ â€˜And your son goes there? Steve? And that's why you worry about him?â€™ â€˜I don't want to talk about him any more. That's my business. But he as sure as hell goes somewhere.â€™ He doesn't go somewhere on his own, thought Coffin. Other children, other boys? And at least one adult had to be involved. â€˜There has to be an adult,â€™ he said aloud. â€˜I mean, doesn't there?â€™ â€˜Or two.â€™ He studied her face. â€˜You know that?â€™ â€˜Just got that idea.â€™ â€˜From Steve?â€™ But she wouldn't say any more. â€˜And I take it you want me to pass this on to the investigating team?â€™ No answer, silence seemed to be built into the  family genes. Now he thought about it, Ted Mosse hadn't been much of a talker. â€˜You are pointing the finger at him â€” them â€” being involved in the murders.â€™ It was a statement not a question. Why had she done it? He didn't have the answer to that yet, but it wasn't her anger. â€˜I've told you something. It's up to you to do what you want.â€™ The storm was really on them now, crashing round the room, lighting it with a sudden savage flash. Steve appeared silently at the door. â€˜I don't like the noise.â€™ â€˜We all have our nightmares, son.â€™ Rose sounded tired. Her eyes met Coffin's. So she does believe in this picture of herself in a murder scene. â€˜Is that all you've got to tell me?â€™ â€˜Yes. Isn't it enough?â€™ Where her own fantasy fitted in, he did not know. Somehow he had the picture of a private yet public killing: murder for pleasure. It's the crime of the times, he told himself, the â€˜Sixties Crimeâ€™, murder for pleasure. We've always had it, the Victorians must have known all about it. The Middle Ages too, what price Bluebeard? But it was hidden, secret. Now it's come outside. De Sade, take a bow, your public awaits you. â€˜And what about you?â€™ He looked at Rose Hilaire, trying to keep his voice neutral, yet open, ready to hear anything. â€˜Is there anything more you wanted to tell me? For yourself-on your own account.â€™ There was a long pause broken eventually by Rose. â€˜Some things you keep to yourself.â€™ â€˜I know. But perhaps better not.â€™ The silence this time was even longer. â€˜All right. I'll tell you. I trust you although I don't know why I should. Twice, three times now I've seen this picture of a boy lying dead. Huddled up, face turned away. Sometimes I'm asleep, sometimes I've just woken up. Sometimes I'm right outside it, looking at it. Sometimes I'm inside, doing it.â€™ She was speaking breathily, her words jerking out in gasps. â€˜Always it feels real; something that I saw in life.â€™ She made a defiant gesture with her hands. â€˜There you are then: I've told you.â€™ So it was just as Gabriel said, thought Coffin. She really is telling this story. Wonder what it means? Had she really killed a young boy while sleeping? He had heard it could happen. It would have to be a kind of waking sleep. Perhaps she had seen it happen while in this automatic state. Or possibly she had seen nothing at all, and it was pure fantasy. She might even be lying. He looked at her speculatively. She returned it with interest. He was beginning to realize that, a natural fighter, Rose might be down but was never out. â€˜I don't see you as a murderess. But I think you could kill someone.â€™ And it might be him. Already ahead of him he  could see that he would marry, and it might be disastrously, he had that in him, but at the moment what he had was Rose Hilaire and Gabriel and it was 1966. He met Steve's eyes. That boy knows too much, he thought, and yet he knows nothing. Suddenly he knew what to say to him. â€˜Hop it, kid. I want to talk to your mother.â€™ It was late before he left, a calm quiet night now, the storm long gone. He knew a lot more about Rose Hilaire, and a lot more about himself. He was surprised really, but not ashamed. This was 1966, and he was going to help Rose Hilaire, wasn't he? He had no illusions about the trouble she was in. Ten He became aware of the consequences to himself the next day. He got into his office early. He had plenty of work to do there. Even as he sat down, almost as if he was expected, the telephone rang. â€˜Hello?â€™ â€˜Jordan here.â€™ He was already beginning to think of Jordan as a kind of spiritual weevil or mouse in his woodwork. So he waited. â€˜Haven't seen much of you these last few days.â€™ â€˜Been busy,â€™ he said cautiously. None of this was real conversation. â€˜Still looking for your lost relations?â€™ â€˜A bit of that, too.â€™ He had thought little of his lost sibling this last day or two. â€˜Been seeing Rose Hilaire?â€™ Dead silence on both sides while Coffin worked it out. â€˜Contact made for the first time last night. Who was watching?â€™ â€˜Not watching. Sometimes observations are made, that's all.â€™ â€˜Was it necessary? Who's put you up to this call? Someone's told you to talk to me.â€™ â€˜I'm doing it off my own bat. John. Give Rose Hilaire a miss. Stay away from her.â€™ â€˜What are you doing to me?â€™ â€˜Giving good advice. Look what there is against her.â€™ There was a dead silence from Coffin's end of the line, but Jordan, a trier if there ever was one, pressed on. â€˜It was her house. Originally. She had access. Probably kept a key.â€™ He had a point there, his reluctant listener admitted, Rose probably had kept a key. Any woman would. Jordan must have felt that he had made a dent, he went on relentless. â€˜I happen to know that the forensic boys have found traces on Ephraim Humphreys's clothes of fabrics and materials from the Hilaire household. Wood and cotton shreds, paint flakes that match.â€™ Happen to know is good, thought Coffin. â€˜What about the other bodies, then?â€™ Silence for a bit, so there was nothing on them, as there would not be in the normal way of life since Ephraim Humphreys had been a friend of Steve Hilaire's and they, presumably, had not. A plus for Rose and Steve. â€˜You can't overlook the boots,â€™ said Jordan. â€˜Rose Hilaire is trouble. And her son too, if I'm any judge of character. Leave that pair alone. I've seen a lot of good coppers ruined that way. And you are a good one, John.â€™ Not a mouse in the woodwork, or a spiritual weevil, Coffin decided as he put the receiver down, but the voice of conscience. Probably Jordan hadn't really spoken at all, he was a kind of doppelganger telling Coffin not only what he ought to do, but what he also knew. The other half of him speaking, the half that knew it ought to run. He and Jordan had known each other for some years, had worked together side by side on a case of armed robbery, and been friends. But friends who eyed each other all the time, not exactly with envy, but with care to see who got ahead. The patronage of the big man Dander had edged Coffin ahead (not unnoticed by his friend), but then Jordan had made a prudent and happy marriage with the only child of a chief superintendent. In a way each admired the other's skill at living, while enjoying the odd false step. In the world where Rose Hilaire and Belmodes moved rumours ran around quickly. Very soon her competitors in their showrooms on the other side of Oxford Street or in the side streets off Bond Street knew that she was in trouble. Some sort of trouble, the exact nature was not precisely clear, but the word murder began to creep in. The story about a whole bloodstained cupboard being removed from Belmodes to a police laboratory went the rounds with the speed of light, being especially well received at Teddy Touch's outfit, marketing street clothes known as Touchline. Belmodes was not as big as most of the firms concerned, but Rose was regarded with respect as â€˜qualityâ€™. She had an eye for talent which they respected, she knew how to pick her designers, and could be relied on to spot a trend developing and to promote it. Never original, they knew that, they respected her position in the market-place. But, of course, it would be delightful if she took a fall. The competitors in the fashion world watched  each other closely always, for any sign of faltering. They were on a roundabout, anyway, or if you preferred the image, a swing. Sometimes you were up, sometimes you were down, the thing was to keep swinging and not fall off. As it was only too easy to do. They remembered with joy when Alberta Monterecchio went in for culotte suits in satin, velvet and even leather, just when the mini skirt was appearing. The clothes were applauded on the cat-walk, but stayed in the racks. Ordinary women seemed to know instinctively that from the hip down (and especially from behind) culottes produced an unflattering outline, the mini won hands down. Then Alberta disappeared, to reappear some time later, working for a wholesaler selling through catalogues. There had been other collapses, there were little ones all the time, and big ones too like the â€˜Tim and Teddyâ€™ shops' rapid demise (which had been simply because of their slovenly accounting), but Rose had a special place. She was genuine, by which they meant she paid her bills in good time, and employed union labour. Belmodes had been around a long time. Rose was the second generation in it, and she had taken it from a back street operation to a small, high class chain. But murder? The word was passed around, rapidly, almost secretly, like a small valuable coin. Calculation began at once. The first sign of this was two approaches to Gabriel for her services; one disguised as a joking phone call, the other as a polite invitation to lunch, but both real. She knew they were real. Gabriel understood the  ways of her world. She saw at once what was happening to her and to Rose, and where it could lead them both. She could read the geography of a life with the best. She put the telephone receiver down on the invitation to lunch with a quiet face, but an excited heart. â€˜What was that?â€™ â€˜Nothing, Rose.â€™ â€˜I don't like personal calls in work hours.â€™ â€˜It was about an order, Rose,â€™ said Gabriel smoothly. They wouldn't fight now, not those two, but the battle would be continued at a time and place of their own choosing. Both women went back to work. Gabriel, troubled yet excited. The evening before she had talked about Rose to Charley; she couldn't believe Rose was a murderer. â€˜Plenty of women murderers,â€™ he had answered, this was one of his subjects. Madeleine Smith, Mrs Merrifield, and Mrs Christofix only last year. Rose was worried. They won't arrest me or Steve, she thought. Lack of evidence, surely. Or is there? What could they have found? She worried away at the problem. Questions biting at her like rats, ending up with the sharpest bite of all. They don't hang women for murder any more, no more Ruth Ellises. No one hangs. But life imprisonment? The thought was terrifying to one whose whole being was devoted to the outer show. Rose moved around her factory aware all the time of the undercurrents from the women working there. A good many had worked there for years, some going back to the days of her grandfather. Army uniforms they'd made then, with a percentage of Utility clothes. But Rose knew that wily Grandpa had quietly saved enough cloth to make a few high quality, black market clothes. Not much profit came from these transactions but friends were made and contacts kept up that were to prove useful in the peace. Rose knew that she had built on the foundations well and truly laid by Grandpa. Bombed out of one small premises, Grandpa had moved from factory to factory, finally ending up in what was now Belmodes. Up all the way. There had been a brief downturn when her husband, a disaster if there ever was one, had been general manager. His ideas of management (which had involved business lunches, a Rolls with expensive chauffeur, and a succession of pretty secretaries), had nearly brought them to bankruptcy. Nevertheless, it was during this period, just after her son was born, when Rose had opened her first shop. Out of a lot of misery, she created a beginning. That was fighting. She was fighting now as she moved about the work floor. Belmodes was busy. In the main factory, heads were bent over the new German sewing-machines in which Rose had recently invested. Money well spent, the girls liked using them. She called them girls but many were women whose working days went back to the Utility dresses and khaki battle-dress. She had inherited a loyal staff along with the business. But she had to keep them loyal. In these days of full employment any one of the skilled women could  find a job elsewhere easily. In this area a number of small clothing-manufacturers had set themselves up since the war, migrating out from the East End of London. At the end of the war there had been a lot of money-grants for reconstruction as well as tax concessions. Grandpa had not been the only one who grabbed. Lily Bates was back at work, Rose could see her unmistakable small figure with her shock of grey hair quickly moving a flow of green jersey through her machine. She was a good worker. One of the best. Dagmar silently appeared at Rose's elbow. â€˜Bad storm last night,â€™ said Rose absently, her gaze yet on Lily, her thoughts ever on her own trouble. â€˜Sorry I sounded off yesterday. I was worried about Steve.â€™ Still was, for that matter. â€˜He gets under my skin sometimes.â€™ â€˜You worry about him too much.â€™ â€˜I don't.â€™ That was true. Steve had earned every ounce of worry she expended on him. Probably there were depths to worry about in him she had not even plumbed. Occasionally with him she had the sense she was going down through a hole in the floor. â€˜How is he today?â€™ â€˜He went to school. I drove him there.â€™ And watched him walk inside, and sat in the car watching for ten minutes to see that he stayed. â€˜It was brave of him really.â€™ If it was courage, his face had expressed indifference, but his back had conveyed desperation, while he had slid through the door with his body touching the wall. If posture and where you put your body  meant anything (and she had heard sociologists say it did), Steve had a strong desire not to be seen. â€˜I shall collect him at the end of the day. I think that's best, don't you?â€™ â€˜Still taking off at intervals, is he?â€™ With certain reservations, Dagmar was in Rose's confidence. â€˜Sort of.â€™ â€˜Ever think of having him followed?â€™ â€˜How?â€™ â€˜You could get a detective. Hire one.â€™ Dagmar came up with some practical suggestions sometimes. It was a good idea. But she had a detective now: Coffin. â€˜Don't you think the police are doing that?â€™ â€˜But they aren't going to tell you, are they?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ Or not yet. Perhaps never. Or possibly in a court of justice. â€˜I'll think about it.â€™ â€˜If anyone's brave, it's you. Brave of you to come here today.â€™ â€˜Thank you, Dagmar.â€™ Dagmar was a real pain sometimes, coming out with things you'd rather not have said. â€˜But I had to keep an eye on things.â€™ There were a lot of important orders on hand. One of the things that distinguished Belmodes from its rivals was the small chain of shops Rose herself had launched. In them the racks and shelves were filled with clothes made in the factory here. Very, very rarely did she buy in, and if she did, then it was a line of expensive Italian knitwear, or silk shirts from Braganza in Spain. Something special to catch the eye, and never much of it; thus was not money made, and Rose knew it. Money was made by long runs of dresses successfully sold. So her shops with their carefully designed clothes sat on top of great orders for dresses and suits that Belmodes made for a handful of big stores who marketed them under different trade names, sometimes their own, but never Belmodes. Usually those clothes were made to toiles selected by the store's own designers. Two such big orders for winter suits were in the make now. They had been much on Rose Hilaire's mind because the buyer from one store, Morgan's of Leeds, had shown signs of wanting to move away to a manufacturer offering lower costs. Rose, whose own profits were already cut to the bone to get the order, knew that she was on trial. If Morgan's left, the others might follow. She guessed that the alternative manufacturer must be deliberately making a loss to get the contract. Belmodes must get its order out on time and impeccably finished. She was checking the finish for herself, not a job she usually did, but today it was soothing to her nerves. Because the work was good. Very good. â€˜This is nice, Lily,â€™ she said; she had arrived at Lily Bates's machine, and the words popped out before she could stop them. Niceness and Lily's cruel life at the moment hardly seemed to go. Nor with her own miseries, come to that. â€˜What I mean, Lily, is I'm pleased with the work. Thank you for coming in. It's decent of you.â€™ She had been surprised to see Lily there. â€˜I came because I need the money.â€™ Lily did not raise her head from her work. â€˜You know you'd be paid.â€™ Rose was hurt. She had her own ideas of social justice, and not paying a good employee like Lily because of a death in the family was not one of them. â€˜I should trust you, eh?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜But I don't. Not any more. Not anyone till I know who killed Ephraim.â€™ Rose perched on a stool so that her face was on a level with Lily and the woman had to look at her. â€˜I too don't trust anyone.â€™ And then, delicately, as if it was something she hardly wanted to admit to, â€˜Much.â€™ â€˜Do you think they will want me to identify Ephraim?â€™ â€˜No, Lily.â€™ Though someone would have to do the job. But the child had parents. It was for them. â€˜I'd go. It ought to be me. I'd be best. I asked to see him, but they said no.â€™ Rose was silent, only too aware that the whole workroom was listening to them. Lily knew, too. The girls are all pretty unhappy.â€™ â€˜I know it, Lily.â€™ Lily's machine continued to whirr, her experienced hands doing their task automatically. â€˜They wouldn't walk out, would they?â€™ Lily was silent. â€˜I see.â€™ Rats leaving a sinking ship; she felt sick. So they were thinking of it. â€˜Plenty of work around elsewhere, you see.â€™ â€˜It would be bad for me.â€™ â€˜They don't like the atmosphere, you see.â€™ Who did? thought Rose. â€˜They think â€” well, the truth is they don't what to think. Nor do I.â€™ â€˜I didn't do it, Lily.â€™ â€˜But you might know who did,â€™ said Lily in a voice. â€˜I'm not saying you do, but you might.â€™ â€˜Nor does Steve,â€™ said Rose with difficulty. Lily was silent. â€˜Oh, damn it all,â€™ said Rose. â€˜It's like being caught up on a bit of barbed wire.â€™ Like on a battlefield. â€˜And you and I are on it together, Lily. Whether we like it or not, we are.â€™ And I'm screaming with pain. â€˜If it makes things easier for you I won t come in.â€™ You never knew who your friends were. â€˜No, you keep coming in.â€™ She gave Lily's shoulder a pat. â€˜But thanks.â€™ She moved away, half comforted, half deeply concerned at Lily's information. She felt she could not bear to continue her inspection. There seemed no point when the whole place might be on the point of closing, and she herself and Steve in prison. Gabriel would go, all the sewing-room would go. Dagmar would stay, and probably Ted Tipper. They were the sort that hung on. From mixed motives, if she knew them. She walked towards her office, plenty to do there which might take her mind off these worries by substituting others. There was a letter from her bank manager that had a nasty look to it. In fact, any other time it would probably have terrified her, now she  rather welcomed it as a sign that life was normal after all. The main door stood wide open making a through draught. A faint smell of Deller's factory floated in, the air nicely spiced with the usual scent of smouldering rubber that was being burnt somewhere. It was such an everyday smell that Rose hardly noticed it. She closed her eyes and leant against the wall waiting for the wave of dizziness to subside. She knew now she was not pregnant, but she was heavy with apprehension. A car approached, stopped, a door slammed. Rose opened her eyes. She saw a man and a woman walking towards the factory. She had no difficulty in recognizing the man as one of the policemen who had hovered around her and Steve. She had never heard his name. Without conscious volition, she backed into her office and stood behind the door. There was a mirror above in whose reflection she saw Ted Tipper advance down the corridor and meet face to face with the police. She could see him. Didn't that mean he could see her? She shifted her position slightly. When you are on the outside looking in, the ways of the police can seem frightening and strange. These two seemed like an invasion force. She wished she could ring up John Coffin to ask what they wanted. They had stayed talking very late last night, and he knew a lot more about her than she had ever expected to tell anyone, while she knew something about him. She liked him. To herself she had to admit that she would have been willing to go further than talk. Perhaps  it had been the vodka working. But he had seemed to draw back. No doubt he was wise. He seemed a man who understood her. The only way he had let her down was about her nightmare. He had listened to her telling him. In fact, she thought he had listened more than once, she had been repeating herself. The vodka again, no doubt. But at the end he had said to her soberly that it was imagination. Funny sort of imagination, like nothing she had met with before, pulling her inside out like a pair of gloves. Ted Tipper and the invading army had met. Ted was already in a bad mood. The removal of the cupboard and the sealing up of the women's rest-room had seriously complicated his life. He had had to give up his own little hidey-hole in the stockroom to clear a space for them to hang their coats. Even his lavatory was now reserved for them. â€˜What do you two want? Why do you always come round in pairs? Why can't you treat us like human beings?â€™ â€˜Mrs Bates here? I was told she was.â€™ â€˜This worries me. Rose knew Ted in this mood: he remembered that he was the son of a man who had been dresser to George Robey, and grandson of a woman who had known Crippen. She came out of her room. â€˜I'm Mrs Hilaire. What is it you want?â€™ The policeman either knew his way around or had been briefed, because he had already moved in the  direction of the workrooms, followed by an angry Ted Tipper muttering about the bloody police. The woman police officer and Rose faced each other. â€˜Is it to identify the boy?â€™ All she got in reply was a smile and a shake of the head. â€˜Ask Sergeant Davis.â€™ Lily appeared through the swing doors with Sergeant Davis, shrugging herself into her coat as she came. â€˜I'll come with you.â€™ Rose spoke up quickly. â€˜You're the last person I'd want.â€™ â€˜Let me go,â€™ said Gabriel, suddenly appearing. Sergeant Davis looked at the woman detective. â€˜Come on, Gillian.â€™ Rose intervened. â€˜Wait a minute. Why Lily? Why not the mother? Or if not the mother, then the stepfather?â€™ Sergeant Davis said, unemotionally, â€˜The mother says it is not Ephraim. Cannot be, because she has had a message from a clairvoyant that her son is alive and well and living in Wapping. We can't trust to that, Mrs Hilaire. His stepfather thinks it might be the boy. Might not. We believe he knows it is, but can't bring himself to admit it. That's why, Mrs Hilaire.â€™ He looked at the policewoman. Gillian put a soothing hand on Lily's arm. â€˜It's only a formal identification, Mrs Bates. We'll make it as easy as we can for you. Just a quick look. The clothes will do it, probably.â€™ Lily jerked away. â€˜I shall know what to do. I'll pay my respects to him without you telling me to take a  quick look. I've laid them out in my time. I know what death is.â€™ Sergeant Davis gave Gillian Murphy a quick, sharp look. â€˜All right, Mrs Bates,â€™ she said. â€˜We'll do it your way. â€˜And I don't want you,â€™ said Lily to Gabriel. â€˜Sorry. Only trying to help.â€™ â€˜Come on, my dear.â€™ Gillian led her out to the waiting car. Gabriel and Rose watched Lily's back. Unconsciously they had moved together as if for support. â€˜I'm glad she's gone,â€™ said Davis. â€˜There's a bit more to it than an identification.â€™ Rose waited. â€˜Mrs Bates won't come back here. We shall be taking her home. Be taking a look at her house.â€™ She'll need someone with her.â€™ â€˜Not you, Mrs Hilaire.â€™ Rose looked at him, scenting a mixture of threat and impertinence. â€˜Because we still need you here,â€™ went on Davis easily. â€˜A forensic team need to have a look round. With your permission, of course.â€™ Fear took a firm grip on Rose's stomach. â€˜Why? You've inspected the washroom, taken away a cupboard, photographed all over the place.â€™ â€˜Can I just say we need to do it? We know what we are looking for. â€˜I don't know, though. What is it?â€™ â€˜And don't worry about Mrs Bates,â€™ he went on, ignoring her question. â€˜I promise you we will look after her. We shall see she's all right.â€™ â€˜When will you be here?â€™ â€˜Can't say precisely, Mrs Hilaire. You understand our difficulties. But you'll get a phone call.â€™ â€˜And how long will it take? I've got several big orders to get out.â€™ Rose was getting frantic. â€˜We'll do our best; we won't get in your way more than we can help.â€™ â€˜And what does that mean?â€™ â€˜It means as much as I can make it mean.â€™ Which means precisely nothing, Rose thought. Sergeant Davis had managed to conduct the whole conversation nicely balanced on an edge between politeness and aggression. He frightened Rose. She wanted to hit him, and she knew he knew she wanted to. If this was the new breed of policeman, she didn't like it. His hair was on the long side too, and she was almost sure he bleached the ends. â€˜Oh, and Mrs Hilaire, one other thing, the message is we may need to see your own place. Where you live, I mean. Riverwalk, isn't it?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Rose uneasily. The hand was now gripping even harder at the centre she called her terror spot. She was beginning to think her heart was involved. Certainly something was banging away painfully inside her and causing her trouble in breathing. Gabriel, silent all this time, moved to her side. â€˜Are you all right?â€™ â€˜Mrs Hilaire?â€™ said Davis questioningly. â€˜I'm upset, that's all! What is it you want from where I live? What are you looking for?â€™ â€˜I can't answer that because I don't know.â€™ She didn't believe him. â€˜But once again, I promise the whole job will be done as expeditiously as possible.â€™ â€˜But what's it to do with?â€™ â€˜It's to do with a death, Mrs Hilaire, the death of a boy. It looks as though the body was moved before it was buried. At least once, perhaps twice.â€™ At last she had extracted a picture from him. A picture of a boy being strangled, then stabbed. Of that boy being moved, and hidden in the cupboard in the washroom in Belmodes, then moved again to the house in Mouncy Street. A house she had once owned. Somewhere in all the moves the body contriving to lose its boots which then turned up in Steve's bag at school. It all chimed in horribly with that waking vision of hers. Whichever way you looked, the Hilaires were right in it. Now all she wanted was for him to go, so she could sit down and think it over. It might be sensible to get a solicitor. She could see she was at the point where the police might be going to do some hard questioning. â€˜Goodbye, Sergeant. I'll be ready.â€™ By a miracle she kept her voice steady. Gabriel followed her into her office. â€˜They must have some reason for all this,â€™ she said uneasily. â€˜Something they've discovered. On the body or about the body.â€™ â€˜Oh, shut up,â€™ said Rose wearily. â€˜Go away and send Dagmar in.â€™ â€˜Look, I won't deny we've had differences of opinion. That's style. Our styles don't match. But when it comes down to it, women protect women.â€™ â€˜Oh, do you think so?â€™ Rose laughed. â€˜Can't say I've met it.â€™ â€˜I'm the new sort of woman. Women against men. This is the 1960s. I'm on your side.â€™ â€˜Thanks. I'd still like to have Dagmar.â€™ â€˜He was bloody to you, that man.â€™ â€˜I'm the goat in this business, Gaby. There's always a goat; the one that's going to get its throat cut. You're from Paradise Street, you ought to know about that.â€™ â€˜Come on now, Rose.â€™ â€˜The goat doesn't know it at first, but learns. I'm learning.â€™ Her voice took on energy. â€˜Well, this goat's not going to be an easy sacrifice.â€™ She reached out a hand for the telephone. â€˜This goat's going to get help. I'm calling my solicitor.â€™ With one hand she was searching through her address book. â€˜Damn. Dagmar? Are you there?â€™ What's the telephone number of Fiddlestone's, the solicitors in New Cross Road?â€™ â€˜Old Mr Fiddle has not been there for some time, Rose,â€™ said Dagmar from the door. â€˜What happened to him? Did he go to prison or die? I always wondered which judgement seat would get him first.â€™ â€˜He died. Heart. Just came out of the Magistrates Court and dropped down dead. He'd won his case, though. There's an Indian gentleman running things now. Greenwich 8992.â€™ â€˜Well, he'll do for me,â€™ said Rose decisively. â€˜What's up?â€™ â€˜You tell her, Gaby, and remember to cut out the philosophy.â€™ Rose was dialling the Greenwich number. Gabriel outlined what they knew, and what was coming to them. She felt involved, the cloud that hung over Rose hung over her, too. As one of her companions on the last CND march had said, â€˜When the bomb drops you can't say: This had nothing to do with me.â€™ After this the woman had gone on to attack her wearing feminine clothes, and somehow after that, Gabriel, although liking the woman (called Karen, whom she had gone on knowing) and still believing you should Ban the Bomb, had never gone on another march. Rose finished her conversation and put the receiver down. â€˜Nice voice.â€™ She sounded reassured. â€˜He said nothing I can do, so to let the police in. But to say nothing, remember that, you two, and I've got an appointment to see him later today. Perhaps we should all go.â€™ â€˜I don't see that,â€™ said Gabriel: the cloud was getting too close. â€˜And you might tell Charley: the police will be over his place, too. Bound to be, as it's more or less part of this.â€™ â€˜He won't like that.â€™ Rose ignored this. â€˜And the solicitor will find out what's going on. He says he has good relations with the police.â€™ â€˜That'll appear on the bill,â€™ said Dagmar sourly, the ever-cynical voice of Paradise Street. â€˜I don't suppose he'll bribe them.â€™ Dagmar laughed. â€˜There are ways. And you are Ted Mosse's niece.â€™ â€˜I need to know what's going on. They've got some evidence somewhere that's worrying them. Or if not worrying them, then alerting them. They will be looking for something special. What? I'd like to know what they are looking for.â€™ â€˜They won't tell,â€™ said Dagmar. Rose had an idea; she gave Gabriel a meaning look. â€˜We both know a policeman.â€™ â€˜Not his case,â€™ said Gabriel. Not his case, but he was in it himself, stuck like a fly. He had taken a phone call from Gabriel, half wishing it was Rose Hilaire, but wanting to feel loyal to Gaby. What a funny, pretty voice she had on the telephone. â€˜How did you get through to me?â€™ he asked curiously. â€˜I just kept on asking until they found you.â€™ â€˜Well, you did it.â€™ He was surprised all the same; he had been working on a case which, while not exactly undercover, was one demanding some secrecy. No one was supposed to know where he was operating from. Clearly they did. â€˜Where are you talking from?â€™ â€˜Belmodes. Rose's office. Where are you talking from?â€™ She could hear the sound of voices and laughter, even music. â€˜A club. A kind of a club.â€™ In fact it was a pub down in Deptford, down by the Surrey Docks, where he was a friend of the landlord, using his back room as  a base. A side door led straight into a street. It was a safe house in a bad area at a bad time. He was living on two levels at that time. One part of him, the professional Sergeant, soon to be Inspector, John Coffin engaged in a complicated, difficult, frustrating case which involved organized crime in dockland. It was an investigation which contrived to be both terrifying and boring at the same time. If crime could ever be boring. You got such insights into other people's lives. Even now he had learnt that Pete Foster, the man being investigated for murder and fraud in the Docks, a hard man, was terrified of his old mother and had kept his successful career in crime hidden from her for sixteen years. She thought he was a chimney-sweep. You learnt about yourself, too. He was always learning. Last night he had discovered something about himself, and, as it happened, something about Rose Hilaire. He moved his shoulder experimentally; still sore. That had been part of the learning process. After midnight, taking his careful, indirect route home from his dockside rendezvous, he had met two men. One had slipped out of an alley in front of him; he saw the glint of a knife. Then a blow hit his shoulder, felling him to the ground. Stay in character, he told himself. Stay in character. Three months had gone in establishing his pseudo-self as a friendless, cowardly drunk. He remembered giving a high scream: he was not proud of that noise, he hadn't thought he had it in him, but it had come out easily. His face had gone into something soft that his nose  told him was dog dirt. A hand pushed him further into the dirt; a voice had said: â€˜Just listen; you don't know me, but I know you.â€™ To his surprise, it was a woman's voice. â€˜I know you want Pete Foster, we'll do a trade. I'll give you Foster if you get Joe Landau for me.â€™ Coffin must have moved because the pressure on him increased. â€˜You'll do him for me because I ask and because he's a lousy, rotten drug-pusher. I've got family reasons for hating him. He's corrupted someone I care for.â€™ He had sat up then, and they had negotiated. He had not seen her face, which she kept covered with a scarf, but he thought he could put a name to her. At the end of a few minutes, he had agreed to get Landau, and she had come up with the names of banks and accounts for both Foster and Landau, and the place where he could lay hands on Pete Foster. As he had finally got back to Mrs Lorimer's and was washing his face, he was wondering how much of the dirty water of the drug scene had washed over Rose and Steve. He thought it had done. That was one John Coffin, perhaps the better man of the two. The other Coffin, the owner of the house in Mouncy Street, the almost-lover of two ladies, Gabriel and Rose, was living with greater intensity, even if only part-time. This part-timer worked, as part-timers will do, with devotion. Thinking all the deeper for not being able to concentrate full time on the bodies in Mouncy Street. Three of them now, all adolescent boys. He did not as yet know all the details of how they  had died, and what had gone before, but rumour had it that no great physical strength had been involved so that you could not rule out a woman as the killer. Or a child. Or a puny man who would kill but did not choose to use too much force. Rumours had it also that there had been a little bit of nasty business first. Sex-play plus torture. So you were looking for a psycho. A bit of a sadist, maybe with a touch of masochism thrown in too. Because the other bit of rumour, and not passed on by his friend Jordan, none of it was, said that with one of the victims, the last, as yet not formally identified as Ephraim Humphreys, a teddy-bear had been found. This Teddy, so the tale went, had had one paw removed and a small flail with leather tails sewn on. A nasty little toy, if toy it was, and the rumour was true. You could make what you liked of it. All this, part rumour, part no doubt fact, was at the back of his mind as he spoke to Gabriel. â€˜So what do you want?â€™ Help, she told him, and most of all they wanted, needed, to know exactly what was going on. The other Coffin surfaced briefly. â€˜Ah,â€™ he said. â€˜I don't know.â€™ After all, it was a case and he was a policeman. â€˜I'm a bit short of time.â€™ â€˜We need to know what they are looking for. Or even whom.â€™ She could hear the rumble of conversation in the background. â€˜I'm surprised you don't want to find out for yourself.â€™ â€˜All right.â€™ He pushed a door with his foot, the  noises ceased. â€˜I'll see what I can do.â€™ A man came through the door. â€˜I'll try to find time.â€™ â€˜Sir, we've got him.â€™ He could not keep the triumph out of his voice. He was a young man with dark hair and bright eyes. â€˜Parked his car round the corner and walked straight into our arms.â€™ He was wearing jeans with a dirty sweater and thought no one would know he was a policeman. â€˜He knew we were watching his mother, but he did not know his wife had told us where he'd hidden her.â€™ â€˜Good. Thank God for family quarrels.â€™ With a prayer for the child corrupted. It had to be a child, Coffin thought, and hadn't Mrs Foster been Gilly Slee when he had known her at Hook Road School? Thus began the last chapter of a case that had started as a simple bank robbery, then extended into one of murder and fraud, and drugs. â€˜So he's on his way to Greenwich?â€™ â€˜Yes. We packed him off straight away. Brown and Gilmour are with him.â€™ â€˜Fine. You go on too. I'll follow. I've got one or two telephone calls to make. And, one other thing.â€™ The young detective turned round, bright-eyed, expectant. â€˜Don't call me Sir. Anything else, even nothing, but not that.â€™ After a certain amount of ringing around, he got Phil Jordan. They had never been close friends but they had got on well; lately, however, a gap had opened. He had his own share of responsibility to bear for this. Policemen are not usually intellectuals and have  as a rule a distrust of them as animals of a different breed. John Coffin's historical researches into his ancestors had caught Jordan's attention. Perhaps another factor was the ever-rising star of Commander Dander, old friend and ally of Coffin and now his influential patron. Jordan had no patron, only a father-in-law. â€˜What's the news about Mouncy Street, Phil?â€™ He kept his voice mildly curious. â€˜Oh, this and that,â€™ said Jordan. â€˜Things keep turning up.â€™ â€˜So I hear.â€™ â€˜Oh yes. Don't believe all the tales.â€™ â€˜Who does? What about meeting for a drink?â€™ This case was full of odds and ends that didn't fit together. If he could get Jordan talking, he might get something out of him. Jordan demurred. â€˜Pretty busy. You know how it is.â€™ He paused. â€˜Hear you've got great things going on over there.â€™ â€˜All wound up. As of today. What about that drink, Phil?â€™ â€˜Let me see.â€™ Coffin could hear Jordan speak to someone else in the room. He came back. â€˜Yes, why not? I think I can get away.â€™ Permission received, thought Coffin. He's going to be allowed to talk to me. â€˜The Red Anchor, then? In about an hour?â€™ This would give him time to get back to Mrs Lorimer's, out of his jeans and grubby shirt, and into something that smelt less heavily of the smoke, sweat and beer of the Prince of Wales where he had spent  most of the last few working days. Even a week of sitting there, supping in the beer by a kind of osmosis through the atmosphere, and eating solid sandwiches, seemed to have deposited a tiny roll of fat round his waist. It could not be true that nervous strain made you lose weight. In the Red Anchor, he found a quiet seat in a corner. Phil Jordan arrived just behind him. â€˜Nice evening.â€™ He was prepared to be jovial, setting the scene for their meeting. It made Coffin feel uneasy. â€˜You still at Ma Lorimer's? I had a room there once. Heard she'd gone a bit funny.â€™ â€˜No.â€™ Coffin wouldn't hear anything adverse about his landlady. â€˜Sound as a bell.â€™ â€˜Not what I heard. I heard she took a chicken in the basket to the vet and put the cat in the oven.â€™ â€˜Anyone might do that.â€™ In fact the chicken had been alive but sick, and the cat had got into the oven of his own accord after a bit of baked fish. And got out again pretty smartly. â€˜That is, she knew what she was doing.â€™ â€˜I wish I did,â€™ said Phil Jordan, relapsing into his usual gloom. â€˜That's what I want to know.â€™ â€˜I think we're up the creek.â€™ He had dropped the joviality, even dropped as well the slightly secretive air of one who had been given permission to tell, but not all. â€˜We have what you might call circles of evidence. The thing is that they do not seem to touch. The first circle is the bodies. We have IDs for them all.â€™ Coffin nodded. â€˜And they are all about the same  age and they are all boys who have never been in trouble with the police, but the people who taught them and their family were not exactly surprised at what happened.â€™ â€˜Yes. How did you know?â€™ â€˜They had to be like that.â€™ Anyway, he knew Steve Hilaire, and he could reach the picture through him. Not that Steve was dead. â€˜You've got it right,â€™ admitted Jordan ungrudgingly. Peter Ellis, Mark Lawrence â€” he was the one dressed up in Mosse's clothes â€” and Ephraim Humphreys. At least we know their names. What we don't know is what they had in common that made them end up where they did.â€™ â€˜Except their sex and age.â€™ â€˜Yes, except those two things.â€™ â€˜And they were all three killed not long after they disappeared.â€™ â€˜That's just a guess.â€™ â€˜Of course it is. But it's what I'd expect. You can't keep a young boy hidden for long. Not alive anyway.â€™ â€˜Well, you're right. But we have not been able to discover any contact they had in common.â€™ â€˜Although it must be there.â€™ â€˜Unless we think of three different murderers using the same spot.â€™ â€˜Like Timothy Evans and Christie?â€™ â€˜Not acceptable. So we're looking for one person. And one place. One place where the boys went, then were killed.â€™ He looked at Coffin. â€˜We're thinking of your house in Mouncy Street.â€™ â€˜It was Ted Mosse's first.â€™ â€˜And then Rose Hilaire's.â€™ Coffin felt an immediate need to protect Rose Hilaire. â€˜I've heard tales about old Mosse: how he let anyone and everyone in. How it was called The Mad House.â€™ â€˜Yes. I know that; we've heard it, too. There were complaints from the neighbours to the police at that time about the goings-on. We have them on record. There was nothing we could do. After Mosse died, things seemed to have quietened down. But it looks as though the house went on being used as a rendezvous till you bought it. I think Rose Hilaire knew. We'll get it out of her.â€™ â€˜Well, that's a circle and a half. What's your other one and a half?â€™ â€˜We won't pursue the simile, it doesn't work.â€™ He got up to get them some more beer. â€˜We're up the creek because we don't know where to go from here.â€™ â€˜Is that what you've been told to tell me, or is it the truth?â€™ â€˜You can check.â€™ â€˜I might just do that.â€™ Jordan said uneasily, â€˜You know how it is these days, we're getting so scientific. Team-work, and all that. We use what the forensics give us. More and more.â€™ He sighed. â€˜I like it. It's right, but not what I thought when I started.â€™ â€˜You thought you'd be Sherlock Holmes?â€™ â€˜Yes. No. Sort of.â€™ Coffin smiled. â€˜When I started out I met a kid who was going to be a detective. More Sexton Blake he had in mind, I think.â€™ â€˜What happened to him?â€™ â€˜Haven't seen him for years,â€™ said Coffin regretfully. â€˜But I heard he was making a fortune flogging antiques in Los Angeles.â€™ He looked at Jordan. â€˜So what's the problem?â€™ â€˜Witnesses. We haven't managed to flush up one person who saw the boys go into the house, or even very near it. We can't place them there. We can't place anyone there.â€™ â€˜No? â€˜Except you occasionally.â€™ â€˜And the people who surveyed the house for the mortgage and the workmen I engaged,â€™ Coffin reminded him. â€˜Except them. And if we could get anything else on any of them we would.â€™ â€˜So they're all non-people?â€™ â€˜As far as we're concerned they don't exist.â€™ They did exist though, they were men with bodies, energies, lusts. â€˜I shouldn't write them right off.â€™ â€˜No. Nor the neighbours, nor the postman and the milkman, nor the shopkeepers in the run of shops round the corner. They have backs into those gardens. In theory they are there. But they are very low down in our lists. Like you.â€™ â€˜Thank you.â€™ He hoped it was so. â€˜Because no witnesses. No direct evidence. All we have is Charley who makes a living doing photography, and a pretty successful living it looks too, who said he's almost sure he saw a boy, can't say whom, standing at the gate of your house one evening about three weeks or so ago. Could have been Ephraim.â€™ â€˜What was Charlie doing?â€™ â€˜Taking photographs.â€™ â€˜Pity he didn't take that one.â€™ â€˜And then we have an old lady, more or less an invalid so she never goes out, who thinks she saw someone climbing over the garden fence one night. She called her son, he's the chemist, but he couldn't see anyone.â€™ â€˜Does seem a load of nothing. But it's always the way. Then something cracks open and you have a case. Or you didn't; he had to admit that was the way too. â€˜I can see why you want the forensic boys on it,â€™ he added thoughtfully. â€˜Yes. And what they have told us is that the first body was too far decomposed to be very helpful. He went in about twelve months ago. But it looks as if he was strangled, might have been drugged. Some evidence of having been beaten before death and probably sexually assaulted.â€™ â€˜That was the body dressed up in Mosse's clothes?â€™ â€˜Yes. They were just wrapped around him. Then the second body â€” in time, that is; the one found first because it was on top â€” had also been strangled, and possibly sexually assaulted. Traces of drugs. Both of these lads had bits and pieces on their clothes and bodies that placed them as killed in the house where they were buried. Probably in the same room where they were found.â€™ Coffin waited. â€˜It's the third body, the one in your garden, that's got more to say for itself.â€™ â€˜That's the boy, Ephraim?â€™ â€˜He seems to have been moved around. This is what they say: they think he was stabbed in one place â€” tiny flecks of polished wood on the body. Then he was placed while still alive and bleeding somewhere else. They think that it was an enclosed place, a cupboard, or under floorboards. Either in the building where he was killed or elsewhere!â€™ The cupboard at Belmodes, thought Coffin at once. â€˜How do they know?â€™ â€˜Mouse droppings,â€™ said Phil Jordan succinctly. â€˜And that means he was in a house or somewhere of human usage. The mouse lives with us, you know.â€™ Belmodes was probably alive with mice. â€˜As well as the mouse droppings there was a dead housefly caught up in the clothing. And a slug had left a trail across one leg.â€™ Now he remembered that Phil Jordan had always transmitted unpleasant details in this lugubrious yet informative way. He was doing it now. Slugs as well as mice at Belmodes, probably. No doubt an acute team of forensic scientists, skilled in the right disciplines, could distinguish between the mice and slugs of Belmodes and those of Mouncy Street and Rose Hilaire's pad. So that was what the search was all about. â€˜Then the body was moved again to where it was buried.â€™ â€˜In the garden of my house.â€™ He thought about it. â€˜Seems a lot of moving around?â€™ â€˜There would be a reason for it. The place where the killing took place is being visited. Or something like that.â€™ â€˜Or someone moving in.â€™ â€˜Or someone moving in. Or there are workmen arriving.â€™ He amplified it. â€˜For some reason as yet unknown, the place got dangerous and the body had to be hidden until it could be buried.â€™ Coffin had been thinking. â€˜All this activity does not have to have taken place under one roof?â€™ He was thinking of the places under review: Belmodes, his house in Mouncy Street, Rose Hilaire's flat. All, or a mixture of all three places, were suspect. Jordan shrugged. â€˜If you put it like that, no. This is what we have to establish.â€™ â€˜So that's what the search is about?â€™ Little bits of this and scraps of that, and Ephraim's bits of wood, flakes of paint, animal excretions from the three establishments named, were going to be gathered and matched against similar scraps found on the three bodies. Then with any luck the investigating team would have some circumstantial evidence to go upon. â€˜Just about,â€™ said Jordan. â€˜And you're concentrating on three sites: Belmodes, Rose Hilaire's flat, and my house in Mouncy Street?â€™ â€˜That's about it.â€™ â€˜Any others?â€™ â€˜Not that I know.â€™ Well, he had got Phil Jordan talking, and this was what he had got. â€˜We shall go over the Belmodes factory from wall to wall.â€™ Coffin wondered if, somehow, the story of Rose Hilaire's nightmare had reached police ears. Not impossible. There is always a point in every case where direct evidence has to give way to circumstantial evidence. What would they call this fantasy of Rose's? He thought it was the end of the conversation, but Jordan had a surprise for him. He offered it to Coffin, not as a prize, but more as an afterthought. He swirled the beer in his glass, staring at it as if it was tea and he was reading the leaves. â€˜We found out a funny thing about the kids, lads really, they weren't so young. In all the cases they'd had a violent experience in earlier childhood. Seen violence.â€™ He ticked them off like items in a catalogue. â€˜Body Number One, the first buried, turns out to have been in a railway accident â€” the one at London Bridge, when he was four. Buried under debris for hours till he was got out. Said to remember nothing about it. That's interesting, if you like.â€™ â€˜He must have remembered a bit.â€™ â€˜Didn't want to. Got it inside him like a stomach-ache. The other boy, the first one found, your body.â€™ â€˜Thanks.â€™ Even in a joke he didn't want it called his. â€˜Well, that boy was rescued from a burning house. One his own father set alight, I may say, by falling asleep when drinking.â€™ â€˜And Ephraim Humphreys?â€™ â€˜Oh yes, him.â€™ Jordan frowned. â€˜He fell off a cliff as a toddler. Fell or was pushed. There was some doubt whether another child had pushed him or not. All in the way of fun, of course. That wasn't the end of it: Ephraim didn't fall far, he got caught in a bush, but he saw the man who was trying to rescue him go all the way down.â€™ â€˜Nasty.â€™ â€˜I wonder if it mattered? We've all been through the war. Lot of violence in everyone's past.â€™ Jordan, although a great picker-up of interesting details, as now, had no great love for psychological probes. â€˜Another thing: not one of the victims has a proper father. One's dead, one's in prison, and the other is a sailor.â€™ â€˜Ephraim?â€™ â€˜His father is a wanderer.â€™ Jordan ruminated. â€˜So each of the victims has a similar profile.â€™ Sometimes he said good things as if by chance. Coffin envied him his knack. The same profile of violence, seen and endured; the same parental hole to be filled by someone or something. How did the victims' profiles match with that of their killers? Perhaps they fitted together with the protuberances of one party fitting into the hollows of the other to make a perfect whole. Or, put another way, what one had to offer the other needed. His friend had one further shock for him. â€˜There's one thing the scientific boys have put forward as a speculation. They're not sure, but they think it looks  as if all three bodies were trussed up like parcels. When newly dead, and before rigor mortis had set in. They detect marks. Almost as if they were going to be posted. Parcel post.â€™ He had a rotten sense of humour. What he had to say made Coffin feel sick. â€˜Wonder who the postman was?â€™ Eleven The talk at the Red Anchor had gone on longer than he had expected, and he still had to tell Gabriel and Rose, who must be sitting somewhere waiting anxiously. He found them in a melancholy group, joined by Charley, in Cat's Coffee Shop. â€˜How did you know where to find us?â€™ â€˜I used my deductive, detective powers. I rang both homes and got no answer. And then I saw Rose's car.â€™ â€˜Can't miss it, can you?â€™ Rose was half proud, half disconcerted. â€˜Everyone knows my car.â€™ He sat down beside them. Cat, unasked, produced a cheese sandwich and a cup of frothing coffee. He decided to eat the sandwich and ignore the coffee. He was old enough to remember coffee that did not have a collection of bubbles on top. Over the sandwich, he gave them a suitably edited version of what he had learned. He did not tell them that the bodies had been dealt with like parcels. Nor of the detritus found upon them. â€˜That's it, then,â€™ said Rose. â€˜They have a good idea who they are after and now they are looking for evidence to back it up.â€™ Life in Paradise Street had made her cynical about police work. â€˜We might as well go home and watch.â€™ â€˜Will they let us?â€™ Gabriel took over John Coffin's  neglected cup and began to drink it in anxious little sips. â€˜They're all over my place too,â€™ said Charley. â€˜The studio, all the store-rooms. The darkroom, even. I had to give them the keys. Just because I'm your tenant, Rose.â€™ â€˜Sorry.â€™ â€˜Oh, blame Gabriel. She got me in.â€™ He laughed, as if the idea amused him. â€˜If you're worried,â€™ Coffin reminded him, â€˜remember, I'm in there with you. It's my house in Mouncy Street.â€™ â€˜Oh, no one suspects you. Not really.â€™ Gabriel put down the cup, a little line of froth on her upper lip like a moustache. She looked pretty but pale, for once not concerned for her appearance but for her friends. â€˜Policemen have been killers before now.â€™ Rose said: â€˜Gabriel, if I'm arrested, you must take over. You will be in charge of Belmodes. Don't let Dagmar get control; I fear that above anything.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Gabriel, both excited and frightened at the prospect. â€˜I think I can manage Dagmar.â€™ â€˜As for the shops, let Lesley Jones who runs Beauchamp Place shop be in charge of the whole chain. She's got a head on her shoulders. But keeps her hands out of the till.â€™ Gabriel nodded solemnly. â€˜You can trust me.â€™ Coffin finished his sandwich. This was a side of both women he had never seen, although Charley could have enlightened him. He felt sad. Rose's kingdom was being divided up. He wanted to say, â€˜Don't do it. Remember King Lear. You'll never get it back.â€™ He chewed the dry crust without speaking. Perhaps it was true. Perhaps Gabriel was to be trusted. But he felt instinctively that in matters of this sort, she was not. â€˜Can I finish my coffee, please? If there's any left. This bread is rather dry.â€™ Masculine intuition, he thought; these two, perhaps you shouldn't trust it, but these two between them could stitch me up. â€˜It's a horrible business.â€™ Rose sounded deeply troubled. â€˜These poor boys. I wonder what else they will discover.â€™ She got up to go. â€˜I'll pay for everyone, Cat. My party.â€™ â€˜Won't the police still be in your place?â€™ â€˜Yes. I gave them the keys. But they can't keep me out of my own house, can they?â€™ She looked at Coffin with inquiry. â€˜Probably not.â€™ â€˜I have to collect Steve. I left instructions he was not to go home on his own. Ever. Don't want him going missing. â€˜You'll find that difficult to keep up,â€™ observed Charley. â€˜Where is he now, for instance?â€™ He looked at the clock on the wall. â€˜Well after school hours, I'd say.â€™ â€˜Tonight he goes swimming with the PT teacher in charge. I collect him from the swimming pool. Now.â€™ Coffin rose with her. â€˜Can you give me a ride back to Mrs Lorimer's?â€™ Rose was silent in the car, but she drove in her usual manner only rather faster. In fact, very fast. â€˜Worried about Steve?â€™ Coffin hung on to the side of the car door as it swerved round a cyclist. â€˜A bit. But he'll wait for me.â€™ â€˜So what's worrying you?â€™ â€˜After all we've been talking about? Obvious, I should think.â€™ â€˜I saw your face half way through the talk. What did that expression mean?â€™ Rose drove silently for a few minutes. Up the hill, across the Heath to Lorimer's, newly painted battleship grey, Mrs Lorimer's favourite colour. â€˜You know my nightmare â€” that I am seeing a dead boy (whom I never recognize) on the ground at my feet. Sometimes I seem to be floating above it all, and sometimes I am so much inside I can smell the boy.â€™ Coffin kept silent. â€˜This time as I talked I felt the ground move. It moves, I thought. My feet feel movement.â€™ She turned to look at him, taking her eyes dangerously off the road. â€˜You believe me? Supposing I killed them? Can you do it and not know? A kind of automatic killing in sleep?â€™ Cautiously he said, â€˜In certain circumstances, yes. Not you, though.â€™ Rose kept her eyes on him. â€˜No?â€™ â€˜No. I never believed you didn't know something more real in your mind. In the beginning, yes, it was a kind of dream. But little by little you've remembered. If remembered is the word.â€™ Her eyes dropped. â€˜One day you are going to tell me just a little bit more of this experience of yours.â€™ Through stiff lips, she said. â€˜Am I?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ Rose leaned across to open the door on his side. â€˜You get out here.â€™ Rose drove home, collecting Steve, who was waiting for her, in company with Jim Gordon, the games and swimming specialist from Hook Road. Mr Gordon also taught woodwork and gardening, the educational powers-that-be liking to get value for money. Only religious instruction was denied him. He was also the driver of the school mini-bus which was Hook Road's current pride. Mr Gordon let no one else touch it. Rose and Jim Gordon were old acquaintances and enemies. Steve had had many a brush with Gordon long before the matter of Ephraim's boots in his sports bag. Steve had always been a natural upsetter of any apple-cart his foot came near, whereas Jim Gordon was a sheriff at heart. He was a tall, burly man, in whose company, it always seemed to Rose, Steve looked like a prisoner. They were standing side by side now, and came forward together to the car, and although Jim Gordon had not got his hand on Steve's shoulder, Rose got the distinct impression he might have had. As they drove away, Rose said, â€˜Are you on bad terms with that man?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ Monosyllabic with her as ever, Steve could get feeling into one word. â€˜But you don't like each other?â€™ â€˜He's a teacher.â€™ For Steve, that was communication. Rose drove on home. She knew for certain now, in the way that mothers can, that Steve was protecting  someone, probably a man, possibly a teacher, but someone who had authority over him. Someone he both respected and feared. As it might be you, she told herself ironically. At the door of the flat, Rose said, â€˜I've made shepherd's pie for your supper, your favourite.â€™ â€˜You didn't make it. Mrs Hodges made it.â€™ Steve was talking to her that much. Mrs Hodges was Rose's daily house-cleaner and occasional cook. â€˜I did the essential part,â€™ said Rose. â€˜I ordered it.â€™ Laugh, damn you, she thought; I've made a joke. Not a good one, a very small one, but in the circumstances I deserve a laugh. The savoury smell greeted them as they went through the door. A woman detective whose face she recognized was standing waiting for her. â€˜Mrs Hilaire? We're just about finished. I'm Joan Gilmour.â€™ â€˜Oh yes.â€™ Rose was polite. â€˜We met at Hook Road School.â€™ â€˜That's right. â€˜Evening, Steve.â€™ She gave the boy a smile. Steve did not smile back. â€˜Why are they here, Mum?â€™ For the first time he sounded a boy. â€˜Thanks for letting us have the keys.â€™ Joan Gilmour ignored him. Two could play at his game. â€˜We've had a survey. I stayed behind to say so. We may be back.â€™ Rose nodded. â€˜Very well.â€™ â€˜I hope we haven't marked your lovely floor. Well, I'll be off. Your supper smells good.â€™ Rose closed the door behind Joan Gilmour, then followed her son into the kitchen. â€˜It would be nice not to have to talk about this, Steve, but we have to.â€™ As she spoke she was laying him a place at the kitchen table, and serving him his meal. She got a salad, already prepared, out of the refrigerator and laid it on the table. Too much lettuce and not enough cucumber as usual, Mrs Hodges would never learn. Not a bit of pepper, either, unless that green thing lurking under a leaf was one. Mrs Hodges had never mastered the idea of colour in a salad, she seemed to think what you needed was a match. â€˜The police were searching this flat for certain sorts of evidence.â€™ She did not go into details. â€˜We have to hope they did not find any.â€™ Steve started to eat; swimming makes you hungry, and it was his favourite supper. An irrational anger swept over Rose, so that, although she had planned his favourite food and was anxious for him to enjoy it, she now wanted to strike the fork from his lips. She did the next best thing. â€˜Steve, do you miss Ephraim?â€™ He paused, fork in hand. â€˜You must miss Ephraim.â€™ She stared him out. â€˜Come on now. You know what I mean, you know what I'm getting at.â€™ He lowered his eyes. â€˜Yes, I miss him. We did play together, but I wasn't with him the time he disappeared. It was the day you took me to the Beatles.â€™ Rose nodded; so it had been. â€˜You went to the house in Mouncy Street together?â€™ â€˜You know that. But not after it was sold.â€™ He looked down at his plate. â€˜I don't know anything.â€™ â€˜Who did you meet there?â€™ He shook his head. Did he mutter no one? â€˜You wouldn't lie to me? No, silence is your thing.â€™ So it was. Steve had developed silence creatively. â€˜There's a question I should have asked before this, Steve.â€™ Only I was frightened. â€˜What sort of games did you and Ephraim get up to?â€™ No answer. Leaving him to his meal, she went into the sitting-room. The highly polished wooden floor was marked here and there with chalk rings, like an infection. She knelt down to look. Inside each ring was one of those pitted scratches where Steve's boots had marked the oak. Almost certainly one or two scars had had a little extra sliver of wood removed. She sat back on her heels; from the kitchen she could hear the sound of music. Steve had the TV on. â€˜Ready, Steady, Goâ€™, she thought. She reached out for the telephone and dialled a well-remembered number. â€˜Joe? No, we haven't seen each other lately. I sort of noticed, Joe, how you've been absent since things started popping round here. In fact, I'd say you cleared off pretty smartly. All the time she was keeping an ear on Steve in the kitchen. â€˜No, Joe, don't think that; I'm grateful. You did the right thing. Wait a minute, hang on, will you?â€™ For a moment, she stopped to listen, but a burst of music from the next room reassured her. â€˜There is a question I ought to have asked you before, Joe.â€™ The words came handily. She should have used them before, only she didn't care to. â€˜What sort of games did you get up to?â€™ He couldn't use silence, she knew that very well, you had to be born to it, like Steve, but he had his ways, nothing nasty but cold and dry. You could kill a dream with a voice like that. â€˜I'm talking about that night I blacked out. The night I can't remember, the night you say I quarrelled with you and walked away.â€™ She listened. â€˜No, Joe, I was not drunk. I only had that one drink. That's what I'm worrying about. Did you put anything in that drink? I know you, Joe.â€™ One short sentence answered her. Not to her pleasure. â€˜What a pig you are, Joe. But you've answered me. Thank you. I don't know what drug you used, dear Joe, but I'm sure now you used something. And Joe, don't think I'll leave it there.â€™ She put the telephone down on his voice, before she heard what he said. Still she sat there on the floor, sunk on her heels. How rotten men could be. Some men, all men? She might consider joining Ellie Niven's women's group which met once a week to promote the interests of their sex. She would not give up her bra, however, or dress ugly. Not in her business. Just for a moment she had a vision of a brilliant new line of clothes called Uglies. Stylish ugly, of course, beautiful ugly, and expensive ugly. If it was very, very expensive, then her clients would buy it. Her vision faded: Gabriel could create such a collection, she could not. Suddenly she felt old and out of date. A whole exciting new scene was being born all about her and pushing her out of the way. â€˜I'm a hag.â€™ She got up and went into the kitchen. â€˜An unfashionable old hag.â€™ The sense of humour, of the joke being on her, that was never far from Rose's spirit, made her laugh. Steve had finished eating and looked up. â€˜What's the joke?â€™ â€˜I'm not sure if it is one, but if it is I don't think you'd laugh.â€™ She sat down to study him across the table. â€˜Steve, one of the reasons you've been quiet with me lately â€”â€™ more than quiet, she thought, stone-cold, dead to me' â€” one of the reasons has been Joe, hasn't it? You don't like him, and you don't like me knowing him.â€™ Steve looked down at the tablecloth, tracing a pattern with one finger. â€˜No, don't answer. A direct statement might be too much for you. It was one of the reasons.â€™ â€˜Mum, I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.â€™ â€˜I want to believe that. I want to believe you are wholly innocent of those boysâ€™ deaths. I want to believe you never played about with drugs or silly games. In short, I want to believe you are a victim. â€˜It was a good shepherd's pie,â€™ said Steve. â€˜Thanks.â€™ Rose smiled at him. Yes, and thank you can come in many different forms. If her son was a  liar and a deceiver, then he knew how to sound a sincere one. Besides, kids don't kill kids, do they? Not even in Paradise Street had Rose met that phenomenon. As she cleaned away the dishes she wondered what those wooden scrapings from her floor would tell the forensic scientists. The police team had gone from her house, she had managed to avoid seeing them at work by her long session with Gabriel and John Coffin in Cat's Coffee Shop. â€˜You in bed, Steve? If not, take yourself off there. Bath first.â€™ Listening for the bath water running, she went back to the telephone. She had to find the number. â€˜Mrs Lorimer? May I speak to John Coffin?â€™ She could hear Mrs Lorimer shouting for her favourite lodger, then she heard her say in a loud voice, â€˜It's a woman. She didn't give her name. Sounds like Rose Hilaire.â€™ In the war Mrs Lorimer had been an ARP warden; in the peace she was a JP. She was well acquainted with the families of Paradise Street. They all had the same voice, she said. She was no forensic scientist but she was a great scooper-up of information all the same. â€˜Rose? Is that really you?â€™ â€˜Yes. Brave of me to confront your dragon.â€™ â€˜No dragon,â€™ said Coffin, casting a cautious eye towards Mrs Lorimer. â€˜You were quite right: I have got more to tell you. Can we talk?â€™ â€˜Now? Shall I come over?â€™ â€˜No, not here.â€™ She thought of Steve. â€˜Let's meet on neutral territory.â€™ â€˜Cat's or the Red Anchor?â€™ â€˜The Red Anchor. I can park the car outside.â€™ Before she left Rose looked in at Steve. Her son was deeply asleep, one hand underneath his cheek. He was there before Rose with some whisky waiting for her. She drank it without protest. â€˜So that's the way of it, how I think it was. I was high on LSD probably, but that's just a guess.â€™ â€˜A bad trip.â€™ Rose gave a shudder. â€˜God help us all. I can't tell you the terrible sense of horror I had. It was like Doomsday. I think I must have been stumbling round. I hope on my feet. But it could have been on my knees. â€˜Gabriel saw you.â€™ â€˜She did? God bless Gabriel. Or do I mean that? What did she see?â€™ â€˜You were in Mouncy Street,â€™ he said gravely. â€˜Do you think that was where I saw the body? That I really saw it? When I woke up I was in my own bed with a terrible hangover. Threw my system for days. I thought I was pregnant.â€™ She drank a good gulp of whisky. â€˜And then, although the other horrors faded, I still saw the dead body lying there. I couldn't say where, except it was like a pit, and sometimes I was floating above and it was nothing to do with me. But sometimes, I said No, Rose. You did it. Your hands feel that body. Carry the memory on their fingers.â€™ She looked at him. â€˜I hope I didn't. If I did, can I claim it was the drug?â€™ â€˜Almost certainly. Rose, I'll have to talk to Phil Jordan.â€™ Or he might speak to Commander Dander. Rupert the Dandy, that sometimes kindly, but always alarming, figure. â€˜I know.â€™ She finished the whisky. â€˜Where will he find Joe Landau?â€™ Vaguely she said, â€˜Oh, he'll be around. In the club, for a start. Where do you think he comes in?â€™ â€˜God knows.â€™ â€˜I don't think Joe would kill.â€™ â€˜No?â€™ He wanted to get Joe for something. â€˜No. Playing games, that's one thing, the bastard, but killing I don't see.â€™ â€˜Anyone can.â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ She frowned. â€˜I just have to hope it wasn't me. â€˜It wasn't you three times,â€™ he reminded her. â€˜No.â€™ She seized that. â€˜So I saw something, but didn't do it. And there's one other thing: I had this sensation of movement. Like being on a boat, I think,â€™ she added doubtfully. â€˜I wonder if that means anything.â€™ â€˜I don't know. Drink up.â€™ They parted amiably, even affectionately. John Coffin saw her into the car and watched her drive away, then himself walked home across the Heath. Several people had noticed them in the bar, but no one saw when they left. At some time between that parting and morning Rose Hilaire disappeared. Her car was parked outside  where she lived, but she herself was nowhere to be found. Her son, Steve, got up, gave himself breakfast, and took himself to school without reporting her absence. As he said later, she was often away from home. Twelve The alarm came first from Belmodes. Gabriel came in early, anxious to find out what the police team had done the night before. She was relieved to find she could get in. She could hear activity in the workrooms. Dead quiet, though. The machines were whirring away, but no voices. She peeped in. One of the women, at the machine nearest the door, looked up and smiled. Then she shrugged and went back to work. That was the feeling of the day, then? Put your head down and pretend nothing is happening. Gabriel wished she could have done so herself. But her breakfast had been broken into by a phone call from Charley, cancelling a work session with her later that day. The police had left a mess in his place: he'd be busy. No, he didn't know what, if anything, they had taken away, nothing, he rather thought, but they had left it untidy. He sounded sour. Or perhaps just tired. She shrugged off the cancellation. Her heart was no longer in the campaign against Rose. They were two women together now in a hostile world. Where was Rose? She wandered round the factory looking for her and came across Dagmar doing the same. â€˜Where is she? Do you know?â€™ Dagmar had her  hostility to Gabriel well buttoned up, but it was still there. Judging by her tone, she might even have transferred some of it to the absent Rose. â€˜I must have her, I've got that man from Milan who wants to do business with Belmodes coming in this morning. She ought to be here.â€™ Dagmar had her finger in all Rose's pies, checking their temperature. â€˜I can manage him.â€™ Gabriel had met the man, a long-faced northern Italian. Dagmar ignored the offer. â€˜I've rung her at home and there's no answer.â€™ â€˜Then she's not there.â€™ â€˜She could be asleep. No, I kept ringing. Rose doesn't sleep that heavy. You don't think the police have got her? She hasn't been arrested?â€™ â€˜How would I know?â€™ â€˜You know a policeman.â€™ â€˜Not his case,â€™ said Gabriel automatically, as if John Coffin was speaking through her. â€˜What about the boy? He must know where his mother is.â€™ â€˜Might know,â€™ corrected Dagmar. â€˜I never knew where my mother was all day. Did you? No, let's leave him out of it.â€™ By midday they were still agreed to leave Steve out of it, but Gabriel was telephoning Coffin. Once again she tried the ask, ask and ask again technique, and once again it worked. He sounded surprised. â€˜How did you know I was here?â€™ He was standing in the bare, empty front room of his own house in Mouncy Street. There was no sign of any of his colleagues, but the door to the kitchen  area was sealed and padlocked. Looking about him, he could see that tiny segments of woodwork from the floor he was waxing and polishing and from the doors he was stripping of paint, had been removed with delicate precision. As he came through the front door he had picked up his post. He identified his electricity bill and the telephone bill (he hoped his colleagues had not been using his phone too much) and a typewritten envelope which he took to be an advertisement. He tucked them in his pocket, where he forgot them. â€˜I kept on asking. No good. So I thought: Let's try Mouncy Street. He could be there. It's his house.â€™ Not his case, but his house. It was a kind of refrain that seemed to mark his life at the moment. â€˜You're getting to know me too well.â€™ â€˜Not nearly well enough.â€™ Gabriel could always find time for a little flirtation. â€˜But that's not it, just now. We can't find Rose. She's not here at Belmodes. Not at any of the shops. Nor at home. Dagmar and I are worried. Now Coffin too felt alarmed. There was a feel about this moment that he did not like. A real, genuine premonition of bad news. â€˜No, I don't think she'll have been arrested.â€™ Not just yet. Or not in that way. It would be no secret. This wasn't a police state and 1984 was a long way off. â€˜Have you asked the son?â€™ â€˜No. Not yet. We don't like to worry the school.â€™ â€˜What about popping round? Must be coming up for school dinner-time.â€™ She knew he was fobbing her off, but she accepted it; she was willing to sit in the  back seat and let him do the driving. She was tired and a little afraid. â€˜All right. I'll let you know what I find out.â€™ After a little consideration he decided to talk to Phil Jordan. After several attempts he got him at last on a bad telephone line. Not only the usual crackles but voices muttering away in the background. It wasn't, he thought, that he and Jordan got lines so much worse than anyone else, it was just that more people were listening to them. Give something, get something. He would trade with Jordan. But first he would get the information he wanted. Standing in his own house, once his pride, now an abomination. It was still hot outside, and his house had at once the smell of summer and the smell of death. He was surprised he hadn't recognized that smell the minute he moved in. He made a start. â€˜Phil? You won't know anything yet from the forensics?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ Jordan was giving no ground. Hardly could, really. Neither of them expected it, especially with everyone listening in. â€˜Takes time. But as the owner of one of the sites you've been turning over, could you be more specific about what they're looking for? I can see bits of my woodwork have gone.â€™ As though the mice had been at it. â€˜I wish I could frame the question so you could just answer Yes or No, Phil, but I can't do that.â€™ â€˜No. Yes.â€™ â€˜I think you'd help me if you could, Phil.â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜Thanks. So if I made some guesses you might be able to answer.â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜The wood is a bit special. Something a bit different. Something they think they could match easily?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜No? No, then it's not the wood itself, but something on it. Paint?â€™ He answered that one himself, looking at his own floor. â€˜Stain?â€™ â€˜Yes.â€™ â€˜But it might be No? A kind of stain?â€™ â€˜Yes, that's it,â€™ said Jordan. â€˜Not as good as a fingerprint,â€™ said Coffin, â€˜but I can see it would help. Well, thanks. Let's meet for a drink sometime.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Jordan, sounding as if he meant No. â€˜Ah, I get you. Nice expressive voice you've got there Phil. Ever thought of going on the stage?â€™ Then Coffin stopped himself. He must not alienate Phil Jordan, who was only doing his job and trying to be a friend at the same time. There was something about the wood fragments that Jordan knew and was not saying. Was Jordan trying to tell him something, and if so, what? Something about the nature of wood, perhaps. â€˜Listen, Phil. I know you can listen even if you can't talk. Do you know the whereabouts of Rose Hilaire? She hasn't been in to Belmodes, and is not answering her phone. Do you have news of her to tell me?â€™ He guessed the answer to that would be No, and  it was. What he did not expect was the long pause, and then the urgency of Phil Jordan's voice. â€˜That offer of yours â€” I'll take it up. The Red Anchor this evening. Hang about.â€™ This time it was his turn to give the one word answer. â€˜Yes.â€™ As he put the receiver down he thought: Rose, I've got to find you fast. And first, before my friends and colleagues do. Then it boiled down to one simple reaction: dear Rose, I've got to find you. By the time Gabriel and he met in the late afternoon they knew that Rose had probably never got home the night before. â€˜So I was the last one to see her?â€™ said Coffin. â€˜Unless Steveâ€¦?â€™ He looked at the boy. They were standing in Rose Hilaire's own kitchen. Gabriel had collected Steve from school and brought him home, where she had cooked him a meal. She shook her head. â€˜He says not. Didn't hear her, and she wasn't there in the morning, no sign of her bed being slept in. So he went to school.â€™ At the moment Steve was eating baked beans on toast with easy pleasure. A cool customer. â€˜He says he's done it before.â€™ Coffin's eyes met Gabriel's, hers full of meaning so that he looked away sharply. Silly to be jealous, everyone knew Rose was no chaste angel. â€˜Think she's with a man?â€™ Gabriel reflected. â€˜No. I wish I did think so, but I don't.â€™ Charley came in, carrying a small grey cat and a carrier bag of shopping. â€˜I got all the stuff you wanted, Gaby. And I found this animal outside.â€™ Steve spoke for the first time. â€˜That's our cat.â€™ â€˜Has he got a cat-flap?â€™ â€˜No.â€™ â€˜When you went to school, did you let him out?â€™ â€˜No, he was asleep on Mum's bed.â€™ â€˜So someone came in.â€™ â€˜Rose?â€™ asked Gabriel. â€˜Someone with a key. You're sure the cat was in, Steve?â€™ â€˜Certain sure.â€™ Steve was opening a tin of food for the cat, who was meowing silently. Coffin watched him. He did not believe that Rose, if she had come back into the flat, would have let the cat out, or left it unfed. People under pressure could act out of character, certainly, but they also acted according to habit. â€˜Someone's got Rose's key,â€™ he said aloud. â€˜Maybe Rose herself. Maybe not. I know what I think.â€™ Charley put the kettle on. â€˜Let's have some coffee, and I brought some brandy. Hop off to your room, Steve, and don't think too much.â€™ Steve went, without a backward look, but carrying the cat. â€˜Charley, you're a wonder,â€™ said Gabriel. â€˜How can you be so relaxed?â€™ Charley shrugged. â€˜Remember me? Born in a bomb-shelter. I believe they had to dig Mum and me out. Starting that way, you go on as you came.â€™ He  poured the coffee, adding a good measure of brandy to each mug. He put plenty in his own. â€˜What are we worrying about? A few scraps of wood, a pair of pants stained with blood that's the same group as Ephraim's. That's right?â€™ He cocked an eyebrow at Coffin, who nodded. â€˜And a woman gone away who is well able to look after herself.â€™ An interesting man, thought Coffin, I never took him in before. â€˜And three dead bodies,â€™ Gaby reminded him sharply. â€˜Don't be too jolly. Those boys are dead, poor little beggars.â€™ â€˜I'm not likely to forget, Gaby. Drink up your coffee,â€™ said Charley calmly. â€˜I know where I rate death in life's tragedies. After being crippled but below senility.â€™ â€˜But dying â€”â€™ began Gaby. â€˜For all we know dying may be a delicious experience, like dropping into a warm bath after being cold all day. Life's last treat for us.â€™ Yes, an interesting fellow. He could certainly manage Steve and possibly Gabriel as well. He felt relieved. Better she should be with a youngster nearer her own age than with him, who anyway fancied Rose Hilaire. He left them cooking each other supper and drinking brandy. A good couple. Perhaps Gaby was the man of the two. Certainly Charley's hair was as long as hers, blonder and curlier too. But Coffin no longer disliked this; he might let his own hair lengthen. His hairdresser  had said tactfully that short back and sides was no longer an unquestioned good thing. As he hung about the Red Anchor he noticed for the first time that its character was changing. The lovely smell of beer and tobacco smoke built up over almost a hundred years was being driven out by other smells: fresh paint, newly-glued-together plastic and fried food. The cigarettes people smoked smelt different as well and his policeman's nose told him they were not all honest virginia. The furniture was on the move too, with the old, solid benches and wooden chairs being replaced with curving, light-weight new ones in bright colours. In fact, without his realizing it a rising tide of change was lapping around his ankles. Phil Jordan was with him before he realized, breaking into his thoughts. â€˜Let's make this quick.â€™ â€˜I feel the same way.â€™ Worry about Rose was paramount now. â€˜What we said on the phone was true enough; of course, the forensics don't have any news for us yet. It sometimes takes weeks, we both know that.â€™ Coffin nodded. He was still thinking about Rose. What state would she be in if weeks passed before she was found? This is a private conversation.â€™ Jordan looked at Coffin, who nodded. â€˜So I can tell you that the word is that they have not found what they were looking for. At a first glance none of the samples match what they had from the body specimens.â€™ â€˜So it's a No? You are still looking for where the boy could have been?â€™ â€˜You could say so. The team's feeling is that when we find that place we will know who was the killer. It'll really pin it down.â€™ â€˜Anything else?â€™ He had felt on the telephone Jordan had a little nugget of information tucked away somewhere. â€˜About what they were hoping to find, maybe?â€™ â€˜The wood scraps found on the boy's clothes suggested someone, somewhere, was doing some house decoration. Anyway, repairs. Perhaps clumsily. You know â€” household fragments. The wood was stained and waxed.â€™ There was definitely a something in Jordan's voice, but Coffin couldn't make out what it meant. Household fragments? He was thinking it out when Jordan stood up. â€˜Here, wait a minute,â€™ Coffin said hastily. â€˜What about Rose Hilaire?â€™ â€˜That lady hasn't been reported missing, and she is definitely fully adult. If you can find her, good luck to you, but there's nothing I can do.â€™ â€˜Unofficially. â€˜Unofficially, I'll see what I can find out. And equally unofficially, it's a pity you've got to know her.â€™ â€˜Why are you in such a hurry?â€™ â€˜I do have a home to go to.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Coffin sadly. And he hadn't. Or rather the house in Mouncy Street had been taken over by a succession of dead bodies. He really minded about the house. He had arrived by bus, now he decided to cut across the Heath, through Greenwich Park and to Rose's flat. He could relieve Gaby and Charley of baby-watching Steve, and perhaps do some clue-hunting in the flat. Did Rose have a passport? And if so, where was it? He minded about Rose, too. He was beginning to get the idea that he wasn't meant to have a happy future with women. If he ever married, then it would be an unhappy marriage. He could see it ahead of him, like a rock you could not miss. Perhaps he should stay with his family history and forget anything else. It was a longish walk on a warm evening so he took it slowly, letting his mind roam over the case as he walked. He strolled deep in thought. On a seat beneath General Wolfe's statue, which looks down on the river and is still scarred by the bombs of a war later than the one in which he died, Coffin rested for a while. I've lost my way, he thought. Not with my feet, they know the way to go, but with my mind. There's something I ought to have sorted out, I can sense it, but I need to think. Forensic evidence was all well and good. Some cases, the easy ones, were solved by it like an intellectual puzzle. Into other cases emotion and imagination came into play. There was the profile of the murderer and the profile of the victim and the one should tell you about the other. They had to match. He thought about what he knew of the victims. Boys, young lads, not happy boys or they would  not have sat so loosely to life that they could come the way of their murderer. Not quite vagrants, but little lost boys. Boys away from base, curious boys willing to make strange friends in Mouncy Street. Boys willing to try drugs. Drugs did come into this story, that had to be recognized, and no doubt the police investigating team knew more about that than he did. But he knew enough, because he knew about Rose and Joe Landau. Drugs were floating around this case. It was something about the times that drugs should be so easily come by. LSD was the new one. All you seemed to need was the right ingredients and a competent chemist. Make it in your own backyard. So in the profile of the murderer came drugs, and Mouncy Street and boys. Sex and death. Death and sex. Which way round had they come, and which had been most important to the killer? He got up to walk down the hill in the golden light. He could see the River Thames below with the new high-rise housing blocks already beginning to show up on the skyline. He wasn't sure he liked what he saw, but they did represent homes, good little ones, he hoped, and if you did not accept change then the human race would still be running in caves. As he walked he reflected that he had one other item to add to the profile of each boy. In the family background there was a death. They were boys who knew that death could come close. So should you look for this too in the youth of their killer? Come to think of it, you did not have to look far. Just over twenty years ago the war had ended. Every adult then alive knew what violent death meant. This was even more true of the children. A child then might have seen or heard talk of acceptable violence because that was what war was. Taken in with his bottle of National Dried Milk and vitamin drops that it was all right to kill. So you had to look for someone who had grown up with the idea that you could kill. Someone like that might even find it a pleasure. Absorbed in his thoughts, he stumbled on. He was beginning to form a picture of the murderer and even beginning to wonder if he had a match. No face, of course, no actual person, just a type. A young, but possibly not a very young person, probably male. Able to dissemble, because those lads had not expected to be killed. Or so one had to assume. A bit of an actor then, able to hide his or her true face from friends and relations. Probably not very close to anyone. But a householder. He thought about that: perhaps not actually a householder, just someone with access to the two houses in Mouncy Street, his own house and the one next door. And someone who had come into the district recently. This was his own view, because the timespan of all the deaths was so close. Or, if an old inhabitant, and you had to consider this, although he hated to think of Mouncy Street and Decimus Street and Paradise Street in this connection, then some twist, some accident, some encounter had set the killer off. At the bottom of the hill there was a telephone-box. He knew Phil Jordan's home number and dialled it, hoping Jordan had been telling the truth about going home. The two of them had once shared a mistress in Lewisham, but only for a little while. Still, he knew that number too. Jordan was there, and eating supper. It was still in his mouth. â€˜Oh, you,â€™ he said. â€˜What is it?â€™ â€˜When you said â€˜household fragmentsâ€™, what did you mean? You meant me to guess, but I can't. Was it dust?â€™ â€˜There might have been. I dare say there was. Dust is only particles of other stuff, after all. But you're reading too much into it. I don't know that I meant you to guess anything,â€™ he said grudgingly. Coffin waited: he knew his man. â€˜As it happens, there was something else. I believe there are glass fragments. Forensics can identify the refractive index of a sliver.â€™ It was something to think about as he walked on, hurrying now. Glass? There was plenty of glass around in houses, and a selection of broken glass in his own house and others in Mouncy Street. Not only houses had glass, of course. So did motorcars. Briefly, he recalled Rose Hilaire's voice saying of her nightmare vision, â€˜But it moved.â€™ Rose, he thought with sudden agony, where the hell are you? He could see the roof of Belmodes as he turned towards where Rose lived. Her car was still parked in the same place, already it looked dusty and unused. Around the corner of the building he saw a figure on a bike speeding away. He looked up to the windows of Rose's flat. Gabriel had the window wide open and was standing there looking down at him. He called up. â€˜What are you doing?â€™ â€˜Waiting.â€™ â€˜Where's Charley?â€™ â€˜Oh, he'd some work to do.â€™ She let him into the flat, where the television was on. â€˜Where's the boy?â€™ â€˜In his room still. He might be asleep.â€™ â€˜Have you looked?â€™ â€˜Well, no.â€™ He went along the hall to Steve's room and pushed open the door. The bed was empty. He went back to Gabriel. â€˜He's hopped it. I think I saw him on a bicycle.â€™ â€˜But why? Where?â€™ Coffin thought. â€˜He's gone to the factory, I'd say. Or that way: Mouncy Street. We'd better go after him.â€™ â€˜That's just guessing.â€™ â€˜Got a better idea?â€™ Gabriel was silent. Then she said, â€˜Let's take Rose's car. The keys are in it. I had a look.â€™ He should have looked himself; he might have got some indication. â€˜Rose would never leave the keys in, would she?â€™ â€˜You bet,â€™ said Gabriel with conviction. â€˜Can you drive this thing?â€™ He looked at the foreign  controls. No broken windows or splintered windscreen? â€˜Drive anything,â€™ said Gabriel, which was a complete lie, but she had always longed to get her hands on Rose's car. â€˜Rose ever have an accident in it?â€™ â€˜Not that I know of. No, I'm sure not. Why?â€™ The car was already on the move. He answered with another question. â€˜How was Steve? Did he seem frightened?â€™ Coffin was already beginning to wonder if he could fit a face to the type of killer he had imagined. â€˜Didn't say a thing after you left. He never does. He could have been scared rigid for all I know.â€™ â€˜I think he was.â€™ â€˜Is he running away, then?â€™ â€˜I think he's looking for his mother.â€™ Gabriel gave him a puzzled look, then concentrated on her driving. â€˜I think a boy would,â€™ he said, half to himself. â€˜She is his mother.â€™ â€˜You would, and I would,â€™ said Gabriel. â€˜But Steve?â€™ â€˜She's all he's got.â€™ The traffic lights at the corner of King William's Walk held them up. â€˜How did the Cuban Missile Crisis make you feel, Gaby?â€™ he asked suddenly. â€˜Awful. I wanted to run.â€™ â€˜And did you feel you wanted to take what pleasure you could while you could?â€™ â€˜Oh yes. I felt I had a right. I had a fantasy. I'd go  into Fortnum's and try on a sable coat just so I wouldn't die before I'd worn one. Why?â€™ â€˜I think times like that affect people profoundly.â€™ â€˜So what happened to you, then?â€™ The lights changed, Gabriel pulled away. â€˜I found out, by chance, that the girl I was in love with and hoping to marry was having it off with a colleague. So I went to bed with her too. Insisted on it. Not nice, was it?â€™ Gabriel said nothing; she had not been looking for a life-story. Right, then right again, then left into Mouncy Street. No sign of Steve, no sign of anyone, the street was deserted in the dusk. Gabriel drove slowly towards Belmodes. She stopped the car, preparing to park it in Rose's special slot. They both got out, looking around. Coffin saw the boy first. â€˜There's Charley's van,â€™ said Gaby in surprise. Slowly, round the corner of the passageway that ran behind Belmodes, came a blue and white van. The van's progress was unsteady. â€˜What is Charley doing?â€™ Half way down the passageway, the van stopped moving. At the wheel was a short figure, arms at full stretch. â€˜It's not Charley,â€™ said Coffin. â€˜Can't you see? It's the boy.â€™ He saw Steve's small pretty-boy's face set like a hard little mask. No expression and drained of colour, the eyes stared past him. He was no longer certain he knew what Steve was about. The van began to move forward again. â€˜Stop him!â€™ cried Gabriel. â€˜Watch out. He knows what he's doing.â€™ â€˜How?â€™ â€˜Charley, Charley!â€™ shouted Gabriel. She began to run away from the van, round the side of the building in the direction of Charley's place. He might hear or he might not, reflected Coffin. Gabriel had lost her head. But he had heard. Charley came running round the corner. Gabriel threw herself towards him. â€˜He's in the van, he's in the van,â€™ she screamed. â€˜And he knows how to drive. Stop him!â€™ Charley did not answer. He looked surprised at the scene that confronted him, with Gabriel screaming, Coffin silent in the road staring at the van with the small tense figure at the window. He would have been even more surprised if he could have read Coffin's thoughts: If the lad wanted to drive away, why didn't he take Rose's car? And the answer: Because the van was what he wanted. Gabriel grabbed his arm. â€˜Do something!â€™ â€˜Do what I can.â€™ He began to run towards the van. He's only a kid, he thought, remember that, he's only a kid. Behind him Charley was in the middle of the road, also beginning to move towards the van. Suddenly the van accelerated and shot forward at speed. It missed Coffin, who jumped back, then drove straight at Charley. There was a thud as it hit his body, which rose in the air, fell across the bonnet of the van, then was  tossed forward on to the paving stones. The van drove on, pressing the body beneath. Gabriel was screaming. â€˜He'll kill us all, he'll kill us all,â€™ she was repeating. Coffin put his arm round the trembling girl, he felt none too steady himself. This was what it felt like to win a victory and lose the war. He knew the murderer now and he felt like hell. â€˜Oh no,â€™ he said. â€˜He won't. He's done the job he came for.â€™ Marvellously, the van had stopped. Steve was sitting at the wheel. He let Coffin go up and drag him out. His gaze met Gabriel's. The girl was kneeling by Charley's body. â€˜It was an accident,â€™ he said without expression. â€˜I can't drive; the van got away from me. I shouldn't have been let touch it.â€™ â€˜What are we going to do with you?â€™ said Coffin. What would anyone ever do with Steve? For answer, Steve jerked his head towards the van. â€˜Mum's inside. I guess she's dead.â€™ Gabriel looked into his pale eyes, so hard to read. What a scheming, clever, manipulative little beast. Whoever loves that one, she thought, will know what pain is. But then, in matters of that sort it was always the same, and thinking of Charley, she began to cry. Thirteen Rose was not dead. She was trussed up inside the van, rolled under the seat that ran along one side and covered with old newspapers, unconscious but not dead. It was this seat that was being repaired with new wood, which was then stained and waxed. Nor was Charley dead, but with a ruptured spleen, damaged kidneys and a splintered back he was not likely to live long. There are some injuries that are mortal however hard you fight. Charley was a fighter, but this was one he would not win. Gabriel sat by his bedside, uncertain if she wished him to live or die. It was hard for her to believe that it had been Charley, her Charley, who had killed three boys. â€˜Why did you do it, Charley?â€™ There was a policeman at the bottom of the bed, so perhaps it was a silly question to expect Charley to answer. â€˜Oh, kid, there's not always a Why, just a How and a When.â€™ â€˜I don't understand.â€™ â€˜You wouldn't, would you?â€™ It was the killing of Ephraim that troubled Gabriel most because she could see the mechanics of it so clearly: the boy killed in Charley's old place, hidden in Belmodes during a public holiday. (Probably  because she had been in and out of Charley's so freely at this time, working on her portfolio.) Then taken over the back way, through the back road into the garden in Mouncy Street. â€˜How could you do it, Charley? How did you do it, all on your own?â€™ The van, she supposed, had come in handy there, besides giving Rose Hilaire her nightmare vision. That had to be what Rose had seen. â€˜Did the boy help?â€™ â€˜Not a lot.â€™ Sometimes it seemed as if Charley did not distinguish between a live body and a dead one. â€˜I had to help him.â€™ â€˜Not him. Steve.â€™ Charley did not answer. â€˜I blame the drugs,â€™ said Gabriel with tears in her eyes. Joe Landau had been arrested. He had confessed to supplying Charley with hallucinatory drugs, and also to alerting Charley to the danger of Rose Hilaire talking to the police. It was this that had precipitated Charley's act of violence towards Rose, whom he had grabbed as she parked her car, forcing her to drive to the van. He then drove the car back. Charley was high himself by then. The police had rounded up a circle of drug users and suppliers. The house in Mouncy Street had been known in this casual society as a place to go. â€˜Or else I blame myself,â€™ Gabriel said. â€˜Nothing to do with you and me, Gaby. Killing is something private between me and what I feel. We were friends, Gaby.â€™ She did not believe him. â€˜In those Go-away times that I knew you had I should have guessed you needed help.â€™ Between the utterly sane and the sanely mad, there is a gulf fixed. Gabriel would never understand nor Charley offer an explanation except to say, â€˜Better than sex, Gaby, better than anything except creation. You are a god.â€™ The prosaic police explanation was sex plus drugs, the one liberating the violence implicit in the other. No philosophy of death for them. There had been plenty of pornographic literature and photographs found in Charley's room to support this view. Among the photographs were some sickening photographs of the dead or dying boys. â€˜Would he lie to Gabriel when he thought he was dying?â€™ Coffin asked, and got the answer that of course he would, especially to a woman. A straight sado was their judgement. And one who did not want to be punished, either, was their other comment, as witness the way he was prepared to kill Rose Hilaire once he saw that her tie-up with Joe and John Coffin would enable her memories of what she had seen of Ephraim's body to go straight to dangerous quarters. Rose Hilaire was in a side ward on another floor, but in the same hospital as the man who tried to kill her. She had two policewomen with her, one sitting by her side holding her hand, and the other at the foot of the bed. â€˜Why did Charley try to kill me?â€™ Then she answered her own question. â€˜I suppose because he got to know what I had seen and how much I remembered. I wonder if he was there when I blundered in upon  Ephraim's body in my wanderings? I don't remember him, I suppose he could have left the van unguarded for a moment. I've remembered why I was there. The van was in Belmodes and I'd asked Charley not to park it there, but he always did. He must have been pretty close all the time. Saw me, I suppose. Do you think?â€™ She was talking too much, Coffin knew that, but he also knew she needed to talk. She had a heavy burden to unload. It was heavy on him too; he was carrying it all in his mind, the whole picture of Charley, coming into the district, moving into the disused back of Belmodes; and perhaps because Mouncy Street was what it was. But you could not blame it all on the place or on the drugs scene. Charley had to be what he was, too. â€˜Something I want to ask,â€™ she whispered. â€˜Did Charley do all of it on his own?â€™ â€˜I don't know.â€™ But he knew what she meant. It was a question he had asked himself. One you couldn't help asking. Rose said softly, â€˜I think he made Steve an accomplice.â€™ â€˜We'll never know,â€™ said Coffin. Not out of Steve, anyway, who was saying nothing much, only affirming that he had bashed Charley to save his mother; he had â€˜guessedâ€™ where she was. But he had admitted that he had â€˜poked aroundâ€™ enough in Charley's van in the past to make his guess a possible one. Steve, not in police custody but not free either, was in the care of an officer from the Greenwich Children's Department. He was in a small home reserved for â€˜difficultâ€™ juveniles, where the matron in charge reported that he wet his bed on occasion and had bad dreams but showed no other signs of disturbance. He did not steal, refuse food, or attack other inmates or himself. Still, she was troubled. He was a bad influence without doing anything. Also, he had committed such a very savage and ruthless attack on Charley. No one asked the matron if she thought the boy might have done this to silence Charley rather than avenge his mother. If they had asked, she might have said Yes. When Rose recovered, Steve would be returned to his mother's care, and the matron, for one, would not mind. â€˜He frightens me, that child. I wouldn't like to be alone with him.â€™ In her hospital room, Rose said, â€˜I get out of here tomorrow. Thanks for all you've done.â€™ She relinquished Coffin's hand. In her heart she knew that their relationship had reached its peak; they had had what was best, from now on they would come apart. She felt sad and hoped he felt the same. â€˜Goodbye.â€™ â€˜Back to work,â€™ said Coffin. What was work? He had plenty of routine, and a new one that looked as if it might be interesting: the murder of a whole family in a bright new Span house in Blackheath. Mother, father and two children, even the dog was dead, and they didn't know who killed them. So when he said murder, even that was not sure, but it was going to be a relief to be investigating a crime in which he had no personal connection and of which  he could not be suspected. â€˜I'll telephone when you get home.â€™ Rose was going back to her flat. She had had all the locks changed. With the old keys Charley had penetrated even to her bedroom. They had found his fingerprints everywhere. It was possible he had been hoping to frighten Steve, but his exact motives were unknown. Perhaps the cat knew. Once the police got into the van, they found plenty of evidence to connect Charley with the murders. The forensic team crawled all over it, picking up scraps of wood fragments, traces of Ephraim's clothes on the floor, even some of his blood. So they had enough. But there was no glass. There never was any glass. Coffin wondered what a defence counsel would have made of that lack if the case had ever come to trial. It never came to trial, since Charley died soon after Rose went home. Just about this time he put his hand into his jacket pocket and found the two bills from Mouncy Street. With them was the letter he had not opened. He did so now, read it, and was so disturbed that he had to drop into Cat's Coffee Shop to sit down. It was a brief letter from an address in Chelsea, telling him that the writer had heard he was looking for a sibling, affirming that the writer of the letter was probably that person, and suggesting a meeting. The letter was nicely typed, on good paper, and signed L. Pendragon. With a trembling hand he set about dialling the telephone number. Cat looked on with sympathy, observing the tremor. â€˜Don't say he's on speed, too.â€™ The murders in Mouncy Street with boys, drugs, sadism had been thoroughly fashionable crime, really Sixties, and had interested him very much. Two days later, Coffin kept his appointment in the restaurant in the King's Road. He would have preferred a pub, but somehow that writing-paper had intimidated him so he had agreed to a restaurant. If the truth was to be told, he was still intimidated. â€˜You're not what I expected.â€™ He looked: a fall of shining dark hair, a pale coffee-cream skin, a delicate profile. A woman. He had a sister. Not a brother, but a sister. He was still taking it in. Letitia. â€˜You're very beautiful.â€™ Younger too. She looked so young. He was frantically doing sums in his head. â€˜I was born in 1944. My father was in the US army over here.â€™ Her voice, cultivated and rich, was beautiful too. â€˜I'm illegit, of course, but he's a good bloke and he kept in touch. Saw me looked after; and educated over here. Then he got me to Bryn Mawr. He's a lawyer. So am I.â€™ â€˜I thought you'd be older.â€™ Different, too. â€˜To be honest, you're not what I expected, either.â€™ â€˜I thought you'd be about thirty or more,â€™ he said lamely. In a kindly voice (for which, later, he felt like  smacking her), she said, â€˜I think you are mixing me up with the child our mother had in the late 1930s.â€™ â€˜Good Lord. You mean there are three of us?â€™ They stared at each other, amazement in one face, amusement in the other. â€˜I'm afraid so. I have the records. My mother left them for me, although you realize I hardly knew her. She died.â€™ Coffin struggled for composure. â€˜How did you find out about me, and my search?â€™ â€˜A friend of mine knows the tutor in your history class. Simple.â€™ Everything is simple when you know the answer. â€˜And the Pendragon bit? Is it your father's name?â€™ â€˜No, I married, but alas it has been a failure. I am divorced.â€™ The family luck, he thought, now I know you are one of us. He had expected her to drift away, but of all the people connected with that unhappy time in his life, she was the one who stayed. Gaby went to work in New York, Rose emigrated to Australia, taking Steve (who had a spell in a Children's Psychiatric Unit as a kind of punishment for killing Charley and who knew what else) with her. Cards at Christmas was how it went. But Letitia stayed in touch, and together, sadly as it turned out, they had found family member Number Three. But of that, later. He had one of her well-typed missives in his pocket the day he went back on his nostalgia crawl to Mouncy  Street and Decimus Street and Paradise Street. She knew he had gone to Mrs Lorimer's funeral and that he would be unhappy; Letitia was a good sister. But her letter had its own little shock. She was marrying again. Was it the third time or the fourth? As soon as he got used to a brother-in-law, he went, and another took his place. This time she was marrying a millionaire, and it had better last. He was glad to see the old area before it crashed to the ground; there was not much left as it was. He had sold the Mouncy Street house long ago to a newly arrived West Indian family, and good luck to them. He recognized the chemist's, that was still where it had been. Parked at the kerb was a smart new van in pale blue. Sadly, it already had a dented side with a broken window. It brought back so much of the past; Gabriel, Rose and Steve, Charley, the whole 1960s scene. He needed some toothpaste so he went into the chemists. Inside it looked a bit old-fashioned, as if the style had been set by the Festival of Britain and never changed. A tall man stood behind the counter; he was wearing a neat white coat. He seemed buttoned into everything a shade too tightly. The old-fashioned word natty came into Coffin's mind. Neat, self-contained and a bit too pleased with himself. â€˜Toothpaste, please.â€™ He named the brand. â€˜Here you are, sir.â€™ He had a deep, sweet voice. Memories began to roll, like a film you'd forgotten but remembered better with every frame. â€˜Weren't you a friend of Charley's?â€™ â€˜Charley? Charley who?â€™ Something in the way he said it made Coffin sure he was right. â€˜He had a place at the back of Belmodes.â€™ The man licked his lips as if they were dry. â€˜I remember Belmodes, of course. That's been gone a long time now. But not your friend. Charley, did you say?â€™ Liar, thought Coffin. From above an old woman's voice called. â€˜Son, son I want my tea.â€™ Coffin said, â€˜Your mother? If she's the lady I remember, she must be about a hundred now.â€™ The old lady who had seen something from her window, all those years ago. â€˜So she is, isn't she, Mr Harry, sir?â€™ A young lad had come into the shop. He looked clean, childish and very taking. Vulnerable. Coffin wanted to say, Run away, laddie, this is dangerous territory. â€˜Anything you want me to do, Mr Harry? For your mother or anything? I'm ready. Otherwise I'll go straight out with the deliveries.â€™ â€˜Thank you, Ron. Nothing special just now.â€™ â€˜See you knocked the van. You are hopeless, Mr Harry. No car's safe with you.â€™ The voice from upstairs came again. â€˜Son, son, I want you.â€™ â€˜Coming, Mother.â€™ Harry Lindsay pushed some  coins across the counter. â€˜Your change, sir. Sorry I could not help about your friend.â€™ He turned and walked upstairs. Coffin took his toothpaste and walked out of the shop Drugs, glass, a chemist, and, whatever he said, a friend of Charley's. Didn't it all make you think? â€˜I always knew there were two of them in it,â€™ he said aloud.\""
