This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

Susanna's one  doesn't really work at all, but  my one's just like  lukewarm. Oh well, let's have a look. Let's have a look at this  So  then, this we did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess  No. around and try and do any more. No, no. That's right. Cos we just got a real fright  when we couldn't stop the water pouring out. Oh. It's the little washer thing. Just turn the tap. Well I'll get cleaned.

It's a sa kinda ratchet type thing. Oh. Just that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough. Just  thingie that Still, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out? No, not let the water out, you let the air out. When you bleed  Oh I see. it you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it. Oh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that Oh it's alright. but it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively. I mean, obviously it's off now but erm Is Angie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer. Hello? That's got a  a key down there. Oh. Oh.

Or put bits on your plate and then  just like put  this is a, I think this is a lime one. Mm! They taste a bit different actually to the ones we had. They don't like, used to have a little  . That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out.

Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting. Give your apologies as you walk in   Well yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if  You know these, these , V P's V P's, yeah. sits down and says .

Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm.

It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm.

It's the Ah perhaps to the toilet. There's loads er like, in the window  when we, like  newspaper articles and  things where it's been recommended and stuff. Ah I see. For, you know, they all, all put them up. Well d'ya know what I haven't to your place yet, the, fireplace. I haven't put the  up. Oh yeah. Well you can do that before you go. I just hate lying, when you suddenly hear these things come down on, just have visions of like a  a  po pouring out. Yeah I, I, I think what it is, it probably needs a clean. Definitely. And er  I was gonna, er er, look up the thing. Don't, it doesn't work apparently. Cos Jim who was in there last year said it didn't work when he was there. Oh oh. So I don't, I don't know if it's  attached or  anything, I don't know. I'm not sure. I haven't been gassed yet anyway,so   I don't think any gas or anything's coming out. No. And you'll find your stuff's  staying there? No I kept a couple    of newspapers but er Well I've, I, I bought a stack with me in fact  It's . so, so, if I I know, I wondered why you brought the Gazette, I thought  strange!

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered.

LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting. Give your apologies as you walk in   Well yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if  You know these, these , V P's V P's, yeah. sits down and says . So this time I was determined not to erm, get caught. And it's paid off. It was a, a nice place. Nice and sunny. Ba , I had  Yeah. lunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till  till quarter to two  erm  and then went back inside. But you, you sat outside for the best part of  quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, cos it was so sunny. And it was a  When the weather's nice it's just lovely, really nice  Oh it's beautiful! Yes. It's just  and it's so, it's like it was raining the other day when we went to go out  and just could not be bothered. It was really  Mm. pelting down. Oh it was when we were gonna go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no, I really cannot be bothered, it's just pouring down with rain, had to  Yeah. get the bus and I thought, oh er  so luckily Lisa sa , like they said, oh don't be silly we'll come and get you. So luckily, they like drove round and picked me up  Oh I see. and just brought me back again, which is fine. Right. But , just when you've got no transport and it's  Mm mm. pouring down with rain it's  it's just such an effort  to motivate yourself to get up to  Oh God! Yeah. It's like when we had no wa , like heating  or water, it was such an effort to  get yourself up  Yeah. to get ready to go out and the  Yeah. just, cold showers and stuff are like Oh bloody hell! not on my list of like  pleasurable er  No. things to do. Just like, no way! No I  I mean,we , I say, we sat out there and the peacocks are there  peahens. Oh yeah! Oh really? Mm mm. I see. I say, it i , it's nice, I mean, unless you  you really know about it  you have no idea at all. No. No idea. I suppose a lot of business might be done through word of mouth as well. Mm mm. If anything. The kind of thing you ought to do with  with mum is like, you could probably go down one Sunday and have a, have a, you know, have a lunch. It'll be Yeah. visit   It's not that far is it? Well it took us, as I say, an hour and a quarter. Pick me up on the way. Ha, ha, ha! Joke! I see , so we go round the M    twenty five, up to the M four    yes! Yes. Any minor detour. Any minor detour. There'll be convenient roadworks at Twickenham. I see.

And they said that er  yo , you're  you'll be war , the signs would  then, in fact, that er  there was a link up  Mm. with that. And until that I didn't reali  Oh I didn't realize he died cos  I, I, I, carried on smoking for a number of years after that. Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm. But basically that's because of  Well yes, the  his family, you know  family, yeah sure. Sure that's always outlet. sort of understand, yeah, something you've, you know, why he does it. Which is really sad. He's a really sweet guy . But erm Just thinks too much and smokes too much.

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

I take it we're leaving pretty quickly? No I, I had a feeling that I was gonna get landed with the bill there. Dear oh dear! It's the reason you came to see me. I thought it was a matter of going Dutch. I dunno. That's only on dates, you're my father. Is , oh oh. You  That doesn't count. Well let's see if I've got any money. My God! I think I paid it in. Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

By Robert Armstrong OXFORD badly need to brush up their slapdash act on the training ground before they meet Cambridge at Twickenham in just under three weeks. Sloppy handling, poor co-ordination and a lackadaisical defence left them well adrift of Major R V Stanley's XV at Iffley Road yesterday. Any match of nine tries (five by Stanley's) is bound to be entertaining but Oxford committed so many errors in every department that it was hard to keep a straight face while assessing their contribution. In addition their captain Brian Smith persisted with his wayward goal-kicking long after it became apparent that he should pass the task to someone else. Perhaps it was asking too much of Oxford, who have not won a game for a month, to exercise the same shrewd control at half-back demonstrated by Farr-Jones and Porta. Injuries to key players have hampered their preparations and possibly undermined confidence. In contrast Stanley's usually made the inspired calculations of a good invitation side out for a scoring spree. Although they lost the Australian wing Ian Williams with a shoulder injury early on, their back division was outstanding, especially Mullin and the Canadian full-back Gareth Rees. Farr-Jones was clearly in a mood to enjoy himself before joining the Barbarians to take on the All Blacks at Twickenham on Saturday. Stanley's took the lead after two minutes with an opportunist try by Mullin, when Porta's attempted drop goal rebounded from a post. Eight minutes later Mullin's perceptive cross-kick found Rees unmarked for an easy short-range try. Stanley's, moving the ball wide with crisp facility, stretched their lead to 18-0 when Rees broke down the left and crashed over with muscular help from Watkinson. Eventually Oxford, setting up a succession of strong drives down the middle, disrupted Stanley's confident rhythm and Reader dived over from an untidy ruck. After the break Oxford maintained their forward impetus, scoring a push-over try, and thereafter the sides alternated tries, culminating in the best of the afternoon when Smith, Hein and Curtis combined in a 60-metre break down the right which produced a diving touchdown for Curtis. It was the kind of romantic flourish that Oxford may have to produce several times over at Twickenham next month. SCORERS: Oxford: Tries: Reader, Van Der Merwe, Okoli, Curtis. Conversion: Smith. Stanley's XV: Tries: Mullin, Rees 2, Porta, Farr-Jones. Conversions: Porta 5. Penalty: Porta. OXFORD UNIVERSITY: M Oliver; G Hein, D Richards, D Curtis, S Okoli; B Smith (capt), S Taylor; M Jones, T Hayashi, D James, M Merrick, T Coker, J Fewtrell, M Reader, W van der Merwe. MAJOR R V STANLEY'S XV: G Rees (British Columbia and Canada); I Williams (Eastwood and Australia; E Quist-Arcton, Harlequins, 13min), B Mullin (London Irish and Ireland, capt), A Watkinson (Kew Occasionals), R Vessey (Northampton); H Porta (Banco Nacion and Argentina), N Farr-Jones (Sydney University and Australia); A Everett (University of Cape Tn), M Howe (Bedford), T Willis (Narbonne), E Peters (Loughborough University), J Howe (West Hartlepool; D Wood, Kew, 49), D Cooper (Richmond), G Taylor (Loughborough University), G Bertrand (Narbonne). Referee: R Quittenton (England).. Fergus Aherne of Ireland and the Welshman Gary Jones have been brought in as replacements for Gary Armstrong and John Jeffrey in the Barbarians' team to play the All Blacks on Saturday. Basketball: Spanish galleons sink the English. By Robert Pryce IN THE absence of Joel Moore (Achilles tendon) and Francis Drake (retired), the Spanish carried too much firepower in this European Championship match. Apart from a shaky start and the threat of a squall in the second half, conditions in the Aston Villa Leisure Centre proved entirely to the liking of the bigger galleons, Spain beating England 99-83. The 6ft 9in Antonio Martin (21 points) and the 6ft 10in Ferran Martinez (12 points) proved mobile enough to inflict irreparable damage to the English interior defences, and the 6ft 5in Jordi Villa Campa (22 points) sank everything in sight. England's limited attacking options were reduced to the occasional fast break and the low-percentage shot. Peter Scantlebury took an age to find his range. From 15-14 down, Spain took control with a 26-6 burst. Clark's burst saw off the Spanish zone and then a desperate English press reduced the margin to 11 points with seven minutes to go, but that was as close as England were to come. Boxing: Jacobs spies the ladder. By Jack Massarik MOTHERWELL Civic Hall is a long way from Las Vegas, but when Gary Jacobs defends his Commonwealth welterweight title there tonight against Donovan Boucher, the Canadian champion, he will be aiming to take the international spotlight from old stagers like Lloyd Honeyghan and Kirkland Laing. A 23-year-old Glaswegian based in London, the wiry southpaw with the swarming style was voted boxer of the year last season, when he travelled to Las Vegas and beat the Mexican Javier Suazo for the IBF International championship for boxers ranked between No.10 and No.30 in the world. Last April he outpointed the fancied George Collins, and he takes a dim view of last week's easy win by Laing over Collins at Reading. \\u2018I don't think people should read anything into that,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Collins was unbeaten when he faced me and he didn't look the same fighter coming off a loss.\\u2019 After that, however, Jacobs was clearly outpointed by the former world champion James McGirt in New York. \\u2018At no stage, though, did he look like knocking me out, like most of his opponents,\\u2019 said Jacobs. \\u2018I learnt a lot that night and think I'm a better fighter for it.\\u2019 Boucher, who has lost only three of his 23 fights and carries a powerful right-hand punch, will represent a fair test. Paul Hodkinson, the undefeated British and European featherweight champion, faces a substitute European opponent in his home town of Kirkby on December 13. Farib Benredjeb of France replaces Italy's Salvatore Bottiglieri, who is injured. Najib Daho of Manchester defends his Commonwealth lightweight title against Carl Crook of Chorley in Preston on January 24. Spurs away to the holders. THE Littlewoods Cup holders Nottingham Forest were given another home draw in the quarter-finals, with Tottenham the visitors in the potential tie of the round if they can overcome Tranmere in a replay at home next week, writes Ian Ridley. Oldham received scant reward for their exploits, being sent to the winners of the Swindon v Southampton tie next week. Coventry are away again, either in the North-east against Sunderland or the South-west against Exeter. West Ham will be at home to Derby, for whom their former striker Paul Goddard is such an important figure. The matches are scheduled for the week beginning January 15. LITTLEWOODS CUP: Quarter-final draw: Swindon or Southampton v Oldham, West Ham v Derby County, Exeter or Sunderland v Coventry City, Nottingham Forest v Tottenham Hotspur or Tranmere Rovers. Demonstrations may disrupt SA tour \\u2014 Barlow. By David Foot GLOUCESTERSHIRE's new acting manager and senior coach, Eddie Barlow, last night met the county's former skipper David Graveney, due to lead the rebel tour of South Africa, and told him he feared the tour fixtures might not be completed. Barlow believes the tour risks nullifying the progress being made towards ending apartheid and that Graveney's party may be affected by demonstrations. \\u2018I have my reservations about whether the tour will be completed as arranged,\\u2019 he said. Graveney said: \\u2018Eddie is certainly entitled to his opinions. I respect them, especially so as he has just come from South Africa. But I have been in regular contact with Ali Bacher and he assures me there are no problems over the tour and that it is definitely on.\\u2019 Barlow, a South African and former skipper of Derbyshire, was officially appointed yesterday on a three-year contract to take effect from 1990. He had an \\u2018affable chat\\u2019 with Graveney and other members of the Gloucestershire team, who suffered from poor results and sagging morale last season. Tony Wright will be the third captain in as many years. David Lawrence will be staying with the county after signing a new four-year contract. Kent had expressed interest in the pace bowler. Courtney Walsh will be re-signing, and it looks increasingly likely that the Zimbabwean all-rounder Kevin Curran will also stay with Gloucestershire. England's four-day match against the Leeward Islands on their West Indies tour has been switched to St Kitts and begins on February 2. The one-day international in Guyana has been changed to March 7, with the second Test there now starting on March 10. Leicestershire's Young England fast bowler Richard Edmunds has been seriously injured in a road accident. Edmunds, aged 19, has undergone emergency surgery for chest injuries at Leicester's Groby Hospital where his condition was described as \\u2018serious but stable\\u2019. Marseille take option on mixed bag of Eurostars. By Ian Ridley MARSEILLE, the Manchester United of French football \\u2014 except that they won their championship last year \\u2014 have moved in advance of next summer's World Cup marketplace to strengthen their team for next season. Chris Waddle's club, who this week took their spending for the season so far to \\u00a314 million by signing the Nantes player Didier Deschamps, have signed agreements with four players which give them priority should they wish to sign any of them. The players are Dragan Stojkovic of Red Star Belgrade, Argentina's Diego Latorre, the Dane Fleming Povlsen, of PSV Eindhoven, and Cologne's Thomas Hassler. Ruud Gullit could also come on the market after the next World Cup. The AC Milan player, who has not played since last May's European Cup triumph over Steaua Bucharest because of a knee injury, is involved in a contract dispute with the club. The Dutchman is seeking an extension to his contract, which expires next summer, of three years and \\u00a37 million. The club however are believed to be in no hurry to agree until he proves his fitness. He is expected to play again in January, specialists having approved his return to training, but is unwilling to turn out too soon, as he did against Steaua after surgery, for fear of jeopardising his chances of playing in the World Cup. Milan denied, however, that they plan to cut his current salary, as they have a right to do under Italian rules when a player has been out of action for more than six months. Gullit is one of several long-term casualties missing from the Milan side as they take on Barcelona in the Nou Camp stadium in the first leg of the European Super Cup tonight. Another, their influential sweeper Franco Baresi, is to have a metal plate inserted in the left arm he broke in Sunday's derby win over Internazionale. Milan, also without Carlo Ancelotti and Fillipo Galli, have only three fit reserves, in the midfield player Angelo Colombo, winger Marco Simone and striker Stefano Borgonovo, and the manager, Arrigo Sacchi, will have to reshuffle. Diego Maradona, the only player in Italy to earn more than Gullit, played in Napoli's Uefa Cup third-round home leg against Werder Bremen yesterday after taking painkillers for a back injury, but was largely ineffective as his side lost 3-2. The holders, who beat another West German side, VfB Stuttgart, to take the trophy last season, fell behind to goals by Neubarth and Riedle before their Brazilians Alemao and Careca struck to level the scores. However Bremen's New Zealand striker Wynton Rufer secured victory in the dying seconds. Uefa has announced that the European Cup final on May 23 will be played in Vienna, and the Cup-Winners' Cup final on May 9 in Gothenburg. Sailing: Pressure on as speeds drop. By Bob Fisher in Fremantle THE leading yachts on the second leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race were almost in line abreast yesterday as they approached the finish at Fremantle. Fisher & Paykel was the most northerly of the line, which ranged through Steinlager 2, Rothmans and Merit to the south-east. With 450 miles to go, an area of high pressure will decide the finishing order. The New Zealanders Grant Dalton and Peter Blake, skippers of Fisher & Paykel and Steinlager 2, agree that the winner will be decided in the final miles. \\u2018It's a matter of who has the right line past the high,\\u2019 said Dalton. Blake said: \\u2018Tacking the way through the lighter winds will decide who wins the leg.\\u2019 The yachts are slowing down as they approach Fremantle and the effect of the high-pressure zone becomes apparent. The two maxi-sloops, Lawrie Smith's Rothmans, of Britain, and Pierre Fehlmann's Merit, of Switzerland, could make a last-day attempt to overtake the two New Zealand ketches, swinging up the West Australian coast to make full use of the sea breeze. Rugby Union. The Welsh Rugby Union has appointed Ron Jones, a retired headmaster, as regional director for Wales for the 1991 World Cup. He is honorary secretary of the Central Glamorgan RU. Speedway. The three-times world champion Erik Gundersen, from Denmark, has retired after receiving serious spinal injuries in a crash at Bradford in September. Golf. David Graham, the Australian former US Open and US PGA champion, plans to retire next year. John Roger Jones, a 45-year-old Walker Cup selector, was yesterday named captain of the Welsh amateur team. Swimming. The East German Olympic champion Silke Hoerner, who won the 200 metres breaststroke gold medal at the Seoul Games, has retired. Cyclo-cross. Steve Douce, the British champion who missed the Nations Cup race at Wolverhampton with badly bruised ribs, is expected to be fit for the second round of the Falcon National Trophy series in Leeds on Sunday. Rugby Union. Leicester will be without their centre Paul Dodge and possibly the flanker Ian Smith for Saturday's Courage league game at Harlequins. Dodge has suspected cartilage trouble and Smith a twisted ankle. Hockey. The unbeaten Welsh Premier Division leaders Whitchurch must travel to University College Aberystwyth in the quarter-finals of the Welsh Cup. Chepstow or Northop Hall are at home to Swansea, Monsanto entertain Cardiff, and British Steel travel to Polytechnic of Wales in ties on December 10. Tennis. Ken Flach, a former Wimbledon doubles champion with his American partner Robert Seguso, is racing to get fit for the Nabisco World Doubles Championship at the Royal Albert Hall in London on December 6-10. Flach, who left the court at Wembley in a wheelchair after spraining an ankle and tearing ligaments in the Silk Cut Championships, said in Missouri yesterday: \\u2018I have always viewed the Masters in London as the culmination of my tennis year.\\u2019 Snooker: Clean-up break for Hendry. STEPHEN HENDRY, beaten by Doug Mountjoy in last year's final, overwhelmed Barry West 9-1 in their best-of-17-frames fourth-round match in the Stormseal UK Open at Preston Guild Hall yesterday, writes Clive Everton. The 20-year-old Scot's break of 141 robbed Andrew Cairns, a first-season professional from Blackpool, of the \\u00a32,000 break prize for the pre-televised phase. Tony Knowles had breaks of 72 and 127 and, in the last frame of the afternoon, a 68 clearance in taking a 6-2 interval lead over Tony Drago. Steve Davis took a 6-2 lead over Cliff Wilson. Davies recovers his deposit with a treble. HYWEL Davies, who lost \\u00a350 after an unsuccessful objection at Wolverhampton on Tuesday, recovered it handsomely yesterday with a 54-1 treble on Precious Link, Breakfast Car and Wizzard Artist at Plumpton. It took his score for the season to 20 and, ironically, he was on the receiving end of an unsuccessful objection. After Precious Link had led turning for home in the Peter Cazalet Memorial to score by six lengths from Super Express, Simon Earle, rider of the runner-up, complained that his mount had got unbalanced and made a mistake at the second last because Precious Link had taken his ground. The stewards established there had been interference, but it was accidental and had taken place before the second last and thereby did not count under the rules. Unlike Davies on Tuesday, Earle got his deposit back. Precious Link was 2lb out of the handicap and trainer Bill Turner got a mild shock when he found that Davies was also putting up 3lb overweight. The six-year-old was also bumped at the start and Davies's feet knocked from his irons. The Sherborne trainer commented: \\u2018He had a lot of problems last year, a bit of leg trouble and he was breaking blood vessels, but I think we've cured both problems.\\u2019 Breakfast Car was well fancied for the Car Parks National Handicap Chase despite an 11 month absence. He took command three from home and won by ten lengths, but Davies, with a typical wisecrack at trainer Gardie Grissell, exclaimed: \\u2018I thought you could train \\u2014 he blew up at the water.\\u2019 The Heathfield trainer commented: \\u2018Breakfast Car bashed a leg in his last race and got a bit of heat in it, so we turned him away for the rest of last season. Rest is now the accepted cure. It's very hard to find a vet to fire a horse, they're liable to get prosecuted by the RSPCA. Breakfast Car will probably have to go up a grade and go to slightly posher places.\\u2019 Wizzard Artist, who ran on Lingfield's all-weather Flat course a fortnight ago, completed a great day for Davies with a slick, 12 lengths win in the Jevington Novices' Hurdle. Davies, who will be 33 next month, enthused: \\u2018I'm still loving the game. The Captain (Tim Forster) is very good to me and there's no pressure on either of us now that I'm no longer stable jockey. That's my first treble this season, but I once had a four-timer and a second from five rides at Newbury.\\u2019 Squash: Gregory bows to Jahangir. JAHANGIR KHAN took 34 minutes to dismiss Paul Gregory, the last British survivor, from the Stuttgart Open, writes Richard Jago. The top seed won 15-11, 15-11, 15-7 with a display of sustained violence that has been less characteristic of the heavier, more creative but slower Jahangir than the earlier version. Gregory acquitted himself honourably but was increasingly on the retrieving end. Jahangir now meets Chris Dittmar, who beat him twice in last month's world championships. Today also sees another repeat, between Rodney Martin and Jansher Khan. Martin came from two games down against his fellow Australian Chris Robertson. He is more than the greatest of stroke-players and he was patient enough to take advantage of Robertson's flagging energy and win 12-15, 9-15, 15-5, 15-12, 15-8. The same mixture of steel and sparkle could give him a hat-trick over Jansher. Martin beat him when Australia took away Pakistan's world team title last month, and again in the US Open final on Saturday. Skiing: Park City creates a fantasy on the carpet John Samuel reports from Utah on an artificial but nonetheless entrancing start to the World Cup season. \\u2018THIS is the place,\\u2019 said Brigham Young as his wandering, persecuted tribe of Mormons finally set eyes on the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch mountains rising in fairyland fantasy before the rising sun. Today, America's Thanksgiving Day, it is certainly the place to be for the world's best technical and all-round skiers. Never before has a main World Cup season opened so early. Four races over the next four days \\u2014 men's and women's giant and special slaloms \\u2014 pick up where Australia and Argentina left off in August. Often America has ended the main programme. Two seasons of snow famine have changed all that. Because of its advanced snow technology, it is America first this season. And a fantastic sight it makes. A barrage of snow cannons have laid 10 million gallons of snow in the Park City race area known as Willi's Face. The first men's giant slalom racer out of the starting gate today will swing and glide over a carpet of manmade snow 80 centimetres deep. It is woven as only the American artificial-snow industry knows how. Without it there would be no party over the next four days. For the mountains are sullenly short of the natural commodity, their dun-coloured pelts still autumnal. \\u2018The worst since 1976 but that's not stopping the show,\\u2019 says the ski area chief, Craig Badami. The local papers are full of hype. \\u2018Hey, come to the ski party,\\u2019 they carol to Salt Lake City's quarter-million citizens, about 80 per cent of them Mormons. \\u2018It's America's skiing Disneyland.\\u2019 Mormons remain devout people. Their sportsmen like Johnny Miller or Billy Casper give 20 per cent or more of their earnings to the church. They do not touch hard liquor or even coffee. But they know how to party. Three years ago the first ever races here drew 12,000 fans for the flashing lights, thunderous music, fireworks, balloons \\u2014 and, yes, the ski racing. Park City, 25 miles out of Salt Lake, is an old mining town Brigham Young would hardly have cared for. But it is a serious ski place, for years housing the US Ski Racing Association's head office, the heart of a fragile mountain area about 50 miles wide and 150 miles long with some of the best powder snow \\u2014 when it does snow \\u2014 anywhere. Today the world's top giant slalom men lock for vital early points in the World Cup battle culminating in Sweden in March. Scandinavia struck the early blows at Thredbo, Australia, with Lars-Borje Eriksson, perhaps the new Stenmark, winning from Norway's Ole-Christian Furuseth. Last season's champion Marc Girardelli was fourth, Alberto Tomba, Italy's Olympic sensation, fifth. The three times overall champion, Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen \\u2014 recently married \\u2014 was sixth. A devout Catholic, he has said this will be his last season while he devotes himself to his family. Some Swiss wonder whether a family responsibility will perhaps work the other way, and he will stay on for the 1992 Olympics. ither way, like the ebullient newly married Severiano Ballesteros of two years ago, he could ski to a new crest this season. Technically the Austrians have come on strongly, Rudolph Nierlich winning two slalom golds at the Vail World Championships. He was ill and below form in Australia, but has gone well in training here. The Utes who once inhabited these regions handed down tales of gods as entities with a wry sense of humour, human faults and even a mean streak. By Sunday the world's top skiers may share something of their understanding. Nottingham Forest 1, Everton 0 Police escort for referee. By David Lacey THE Littlewoods Cup holders returned to the last eight of the competition last night in unusual and, Everton would claim, unjust circumstances. Nottingham Forest had almost despaired of breaking down Everton's rebuilt defence in an entertaining tie at the City Ground when Lee Chapman won the match seven minutes from the end. While there was nothing extraordinary about the goal, Chapman turning in a free-kick Clough had driven through a crowd of players towards the near post, the reason the free-kick was awarded left Everton disgruntled. Their goalkeeper, Neville Southall, was preparing to clear the ball upfield and making no haste about it when the referee, George Tyson, booked him for time-wasting and awarded Forest the indirect free-kick which was to decide the match. Not for the first time this season MrTyson needed a police escort as protesting losers surrounded him at the end. Everton, still without their regular centre-backs Ratcliffe and Watson because of injury, again tried to make up for this by playing Snodin as a spare centre-back behind Keown and McDonald. This gave them a cushion of safety but often meant that the opposition found it easier to make space in midfield. However, it also meant that the sort of movements which normally flow through Clough had to be accurate to the point of perfection if they were not to be enmeshed in blue shirts. Two minutes before the half-hour Forest appeared to have achieved this when Pearce exchanged passes with Clough and burst clear into the penalty area on the left. Southall, who had earlier blocked a close-range shot from the England left-back taken from a similar angle, looked more vulnerable this time but Pearce drove the ball past the far post. With so many players forced to defend, Everton found few opportunities to attack in any strength. However, a free-kick from Nevin nearly brought them a goal immediately before Pearce should have given Forest the lead. Keown nodded Nevin's kick square and Newell's diving header drew a smart save from Crossley, his first of the game. Crosby's acceleration and close control were a frequent worry to Everton on the right but seven minutes before half-time the winger only seemed to have got past Snodin by fouling him. The referee, however, allowed play to go on with Everton prostrate and protesting and when the cross came over the defence seemed to use less than legal means to stop Chapman reaching it. Tyson, two of whose penalty decisions contributed to the recent battle of Highbury between Arsenal and Norwich, this time gave nothing, but by half-time he had cautioned Sheedy and Pearce for fouls. Forest began to lose momentum in the second half and found themselves forced to defend for longer periods. Nottingham Forest: Crossley; Laws, Pearce, Walker, Chettle, Hodge, Crosby, Parker, Clough, Chapman, Rice. Everton: Southall; McDonald, Pointon, Keown, Snodin, Ebbrell, Nevin, McCall, Sharp, Newell, Sheedy. Referee: G Tyson (Sunderland).. Soccer: Rangers' mystery \\u00a35 million backer. By Russell Thomas RANGERS have clinched a \\u00a35 million sponsorship deal, the biggest in the British game, but aim to keep the identity of the backer a secret until a chosen launch date. There has been strong speculation that Pepsi Cola are putting up the money but David Murray, Rangers' owner and chairman who bought the club exactly a year ago yesterday, is giving nothing away. Murray confirmed only that the deal had been agreed and that it would go a long way towards cutting Rangers' overdraft of \\u00a39.5 million. The club are paying about \\u00a330,000 a week in interest charges. Murray said: \\u2018The aim is to have the overdraft cut to around \\u00a33 million or \\u00a34 million by the end of the year. If we can achieve that, I will be reasonably pleased. \\u2018There will be no trading loss this year despite the fact we have bought new players.\\u2019 Aston Villa have raided the Caribbean for an 18-year-old striker that their manager Graham Taylor calls \\u2018a little gem\\u2019. Dwight York, who played for Trinidad and Tobago in Sunday's World Cup defeat by the United States, has agreed to sign a three-year contract with Villa, where he is due to arrive on December 13. A \\u00a35,000 fee has been agreed but the deal is subject to a work permit. Taylor said: \\u2018We are hopeful that we have found something a bit special.\\u2019 York had a five-week trial with Villa at the start of the seasan after being spotted when the club played two games in Trinidad in the summer. An Australian striker, Alastair Edwards, has agreed to join Brighton in a deal worth about \\u00a360,000 to Sydney Olympic. Edwards, 21, has played for Australia youth and under-21s and, after appearing in the 1987 World Youth Cup finals in Chile, had 18 months with Rangers without breaking into the first team. Brighton's reserve striker Martin Lambert has joined Wycombe Wanderers for \\u00a315,000, and the GM Vauxhall Conference club's manager Jim Kelman has also made an offer for Aldershot's unsettled midfielder Glen Burvill. Colin Morris, sacked by Scarborough, is to play for Boston United on a non-contract basis. Watford's reserve goalkeeper Mel Rees has joined Southampton on a month's loan with a view to a permanent transfer. Blackpool must pay \\u00a335,000 for Nigel Hawkins, the 21-year-old striker signed from Bristol City, if he becomes a first-team regular at Bloomfield Road. Blackpool, who offered just \\u00a32,000 against City's valuation of \\u00a370,000, will also have to hand over 25 per cent of any profit on a subsequent transfer. Brentford have signed Bournemouth's central defender Paul Miller on a month's loan. The 30-year-old player was a colleague of the manager Steve Perryman at Tottenham. Notts County's defender Willie McStay, brother of the Scottish international midfielder Paul, has joined Hartlepool on a month's loan. Middlesbrough's goalkeeper Stephen Pears is back in light training after eight months out through injury and illness. He hopes to be challenging for the first team by Christmas. Stan Mortensen, Blackpool's hat-trick scorer in the 1953 FA Cup final win over Bolton, is to be made an honorary freeman of the town. Cricket: Red rose blooms in business David Hopps on how Lancashire reaped record profits. LANCASHIRE announced record profits of more than \\u00a3306,000 yesterday, a staggering achievement which hardly reflects county cricket's traditional hand-to-mouth lifestyle. Many counties remain so untouched by the commercial age that lost balls are still classified as a major item of expenditure. Lancashire, by contrast, have invested heavily in the daily earning potential of Old Trafford, now the best equipped ground outside Lord's; in deepest Rawtenstall even that qualification would be judged unnecessary. The county's turnover for the last financial year, close to \\u00a32 million, differs markedly from counties less well blessed. Derbyshire, for example, will struggle to reach one-third of that figure. The assessment of Bob Bennett, the county chairman and an Isle of Man tax exile, would slip naturally into Financial Report. \\u2018We have extended our operations in the business field,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Activity over 12 months of the year has been an important factor. But the prospects that the North-west economy might not be as buoyant next year could affect our performance in 1990.\\u2019 The Test and County Cricket Board hand-out rose in an Ashes summer from \\u00a3338,000 to a new high of \\u00a3473,000; and Lancashire's successful season on the field, fourth in the championship and winners of the Refuge Assurance League, almost doubled match income. The TCCB will give serious consideration this winter to the damage to techniques caused by a preponderance of one-day cricket, yet Lancashire's last three Sunday matches at home accounted for almost \\u00a380,000. Only one bugbear remains: the members' obstinate refusal to grant full rights to Lancashire's women subscribers, including access to a pavilion which remains a bastion of male chauvinism. At last year's annual meeting, 60 per cent of members supported the committee's plea for change; they will again seek the requisite two-thirds majority at Old Trafford on December 9. Bennett has set out the supposed pros and cons in the annual report. Why should Lancashire allow women members? Numerous reasons are given. Some are moral: the overcoming of inequality, and a woman's fundamental right to partake in club affairs. Some are financial: the risk of deterring sponsors and the benefit of additional subscriptions. The arguments against include: members should not be forced to share facilities with women, the pavilion may be too small, the pavilion has no women's toilets, women have adequate facilities of their own, some men wish to get away from women, and \\u2018lady subscribers\\u2019 might not wish to become full members. Maureen Fitzgibbon, chairman of the women's steering committee, said: \\u2018This time we think we will do it.\\u2019 Of those who responded to a questionnaire, 83 per cent of women subscribers supported the principle of full membership for women. But only 62 per cent responded, and half wanted the option of staying women subscribers. Rugby League: Leigh 6, Wakefield Trinity 24 Conway's heavenly touch inspires Trinity. MARK CONWAY, a perky scrum-half with a nice line in inventiveness, did much to help Wakefield to this victory at Hilton Park last night, writes Edward Kennedy. He played an important role in the first three tries as well as kicking four goals, one from the touchline. It was an important win for Wakefield, lifting them over Warrington, Widnes and Sheffield into sixth place. They began slowly, but dominated the second half. Leigh, after impressive wins over Widnes and Featherstone Rovers, were very disappointing. They were predictable in attack and, as was proved all too often in the second half, fragile in defence. Just when it seemed that a try would be too much to hope for after 30 tedious minutes, the crowd were treated to two first-class efforts, from Ledger and Fox, playing his first game at Hilton Park since he left Leigh for Leeds three years ago. Conway, whose delicate chip set up Fox's try, landed a splendid goal to make it 6-6 at half-time. Wakefield soon took the lead for the first time when Conway's towering kick bounced over the line for Mason to touch down near the posts. Three minutes later Jackson broke straight from a scrum and Perry's pace put him clear to score. Although Thompson, the hooker, was sin-binned for 10 minutes for a foul in a tackle on Platt, Wakefield were never troubled and two minutes after he departed Wilson dribbled past a swarm of defenders to score by the posts. Conway improved all three tries. Leigh: Johnson (Platt, 72min); Ledger, Moimoi, Jeffrey, Standish; Ruane, Beardmore; Street, Ropati, Case (Brown, 68), Collier, Potter, Platt (Dean, 68). Wakefield Trinity: Perry; Fox, Leuluai, Mason, Wilson; Jackson, M Conway; Kelly, Thompson (B Conway, 72), Glancy, Lazenby (Bell, 72), G Price, R Price. Referee: A Burke (Failsworth).. Skiing. John Samuel at Park City, Utah, on the opening races of the new season Cannons put smile on Willi's Face \\u2018T HIS is the place,\\u2019 said Brigham Young as his wandering, persecuted tribe of Mormons set eyes on the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch mountains. Today, Thanksgiving Day, it is certainly the place to be. Never before has a main World Cup season opened so early. Four races over the next four days \\u2014 men's and women's giant and special slaloms \\u2014 pick up where Australia and Argentina left off in August. Often America has ended the main programme. Two seasons of snow famine have changed all that. Because of its advanced snow technology it is America first this season. A hundred snow cannon have laid 10 million gallons of snow in the Park City race area known as Willi's Face. The first man out of the starting gate today will swing and glide over a carpet of man-made snow 80 centimetres deep. Without it there would be no party, as the natural commodity is in short supply, the worst since 1976. Today the world's top giant slalom men lock horns for vital early points in the World Cup battle which ends next March in Sweden. Scandinavia struck the early blows at Thredbo, Australia, with Lars-Borje Eriksson, perhaps the new Stenmark, winning from Norway's Ole-Christian Furuseth. Last season's champion, Marc Girardelli, having switched skis for a reported half a million pounds, was fourth, Alberto Tomba, Italy's Olympic sensation, fifth. The three times overall champion, Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen \\u2014 recently married \\u2014 was sixth. A devout Catholic, he has said this will be his last season as he devotes himself to his family. Some Swiss wonder whether a family responsibility will perhaps work the other way, and he will stay on for the 1992 Olympics. Either way, like the ebullient newly married Severiano Ballesteros of two years ago, he could ski to a new crest this season. Technically the Austrians have come on strongly, Rudolph Nierlich winning two slalom golds at the Vail World Championships. He was ill and below form in Australia, but has gone well in training here. The Utes who once inhabited these regions handed down tales of gods as entities with a wry sense of humour, human faults and even a mean streak. By Sunday the world's top skiers may share something of their understanding. Soccer: Littlewoods Cup, fourth round: Oldham Athletic 3, Arsenal 1 Double by Ritchie ends 66-year wait. By Stephen Bierley OLDHAM Athletic, who had never beaten a First Division side since they dropped into the Second Division in 1923, made up for 66 years of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the League champions Arsenal at Boundary Park last night. The Pennines fairly shook. No supporter of the Latics dared dream it, but suddenly the improbable was a throbbing, joyous reality. Two goals from the irrepressible Andy Ritchie, his 13th and 14th this season, and a third by the 20-year-old midfield player Nick Henry, and Arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a last-minute goal by Quinn. Despite many and varied flurries of activity in the first 40 minutes, Arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired. They held their line and competed hard in midfield, damping down Oldham's initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half. Then Oldham struck. Winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from Milligan's cross, O'Leary recovering an awkward situation. Almost immediately Smith had an excellent chance for Arsenal but stumbled. Oldham took up the attack again and Barlow, who had a fine match at left-back, totally containing Rocastle, floated in a deep cross beyond Winterburn. The predatory Ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past Lukic. Arsenal had no choice but to attack as soon as the second half began. A neat step-over by Rocastle sent Thomas hurtling in on goal but Rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot. From the resulting corner Rhodes made another fine save, hurtling to his right to deflect away Dixon's rising shot. Finally, with Arsenal pressing hard, he clawed away Quinn's careful header from Thomas's drag-back. Quinn held his head in disbelief. Worse, far worse was to follow. Bunn, who scored six goals in the previous round against Scarborough, this time turned into the provider, putting Milligan clear and free. He was hauled back on the edge of the area by O'Leary, a \\u2018professional\\u2019 foul for which the Arsenal central defender was booked. Holden's 64th-minute free-kick clattered the wall and the ball fell to Henry, who drilled a low shot from more than 30 yards inside Lukic's right-hand post. In another 10 minutes any remaining Oldham doubts were dispelled. Ritchie passed to Irwin and then ran on to head the cross past Lukic. Arsenal were stitched and stuffed, with no question of a fluke. Not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and Oldham exploited the weaknesses to the full, owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of Henry and Milligan. George Graham was not amused. He called his team's performance \\u2018unacceptable\\u2019. But he also said: \\u2018Let's not take any credit away from Oldham. They were tremendous, and outplayed us in the first half. The plastic pitch is no excuse. We trained on an artificial pitch for two days this week and we should have done a lot better.\\u2019 Joe Royle, the Oldham manager, was full of praise both for Graham and his own team. \\u2018George was brilliant,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018He could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it. The manager's attitude shows why they are champions. He took it on the chin. \\u2018One or two people will be ready to put this down to plastic but our goals were nothing to do with plastic. This was a great performanc. We rattled them from the first minute and didn't give them any breathing space. We were helter-skelter for 90 minutes and we scored three great goals. In the past we have had cup walks, not runs.\\u2019 Oldham Athletic: Rhodes; Irwin, Barlow, Henry, Barrett, Warhurst, Marshall, Ritchie, Bunn, Milligan, Holden. Arsenal: Lukic; Dixon, Winterburn, Thomas, O'Leary, Adams, Rocastle, Richardson, Smith, Quinn, Jonsson (Groves, 65min). Referee: R Gifford (Llandradach).. Soccer: Littlewoods Cup, fourth round:Oldham Athletic 3, Arsenal 1 Double by Ritchie ends 66-year wait. By Stephen Bierley OLDHAM Athletic, who had not beaten a First Division side since they dropped into the Second Division in 1923, made up for 66 years of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the League champions Arsenal at Boundary Park last night. The Pennines fairly shook, and Quinn's last-minute volley meant nothing. Andy Ritchie put Oldham ahead just before half-time with a thumping volley and then, with Arsenal heaving and straining to equalise, Nick Henry struck a wonderful second goal in the 64th minute. Oldham's joy was complete when, 10 minutes later, the effervescent Ritchie fed Irwin and then ran on to head home the full-back's cross for his second goal and Oldham's third. At this point the Arsenal fans began to drift home, their evening well and truly over. Oldham worked diligently to put Arsenal under maximum pressure from the start, and both O'Leary and Dixon had anxious moments as they strove to adjust to both the home attack and the artificial turf. Arsenal's breaks were few but always threatening and Oldham, after a first flurry, found openings increasingly elusive. Nevertheless as half-time approached Irwin struck an excellent shot from just outside the penalty area after Winterburn had headed out Marshall's cross. Lukic must have seen the ball extremely late but still managed to get down well. Shortly afterwards Milligan's cross was almost turned into his own net by Winterburn, O'Leary recovering an awkward situation, but Arsenal could do nothing when Barlow, having a fine match at left-back, floated a diagonal cross to the very back of Arsenal's defence. The ball eluded Winterburn, and Ritchie, Oldham's leading goalscorer, chested the ball down and crashed a fierce volley beyond Lukic. Arsenal had no option but to take the attack to Oldham in the second half and Rhodes had to save from Thomas, Dixon and Quinn, but when a magnificent ball by Bunn sent Milligan streaking for goal he was hauled back by O'Leary, who was booked. Arsenal were to pay for it. Holden battered the free-kick against the wall and after a scramble the ball fell to Henry, who struck a low shot from more than 30 yards past Lukic. Oldham Athletic: Rhodes; Irwin, Barlow, Henry, Barrett, Warhurst, Marshall, Ritchie, Bunn, Milligan, Holden. Arsenal: Lukic; Dixon, Winterburn, Thomas, O'Leary, Adams, Rocastle, Richardson, Smith, Quinn, Jonsson (Groves, 65min). Referee: R Gifford (Llandradach).. Golden performance wins him many Aintree friends. By Ken Oliver JOHN McConnochie and Arthur Stephenson were both satisfied with the outcome of the Edward Hanmer Memorial Chase after their horses fought out a thrilling finish in the three mile handicap at Haydock yesterday. Victory went to McConnochie's Golden Friend, whose win puts him in line for a tilt at next year's Grand National, while Stephenson's The Thinker proved that he will again be a force to be reckoned with in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March. The big disappointment was Yahoo. The even-money favourite was never moving in his best style and was pulled up before the 15th fence. The stewards inquired into the running of Yahoo and accepted Tom Morgan's explanation that: \\u2018He lost his action and didn't feel right and there was nothing else I could do but pull him up.\\u2019 David Nicholson was quite pleased with Charter Party. The 1988 Gold Cup victor led until two out, where lack of fitness told, and he finished third, 11 lengths behind the winner. Graham McCourt can do little wrong at the moment and he gave Golden Friend a superb ride. He and Chris Grant, on The Thinker, jumped the last together, but it was always on the cards that McCourt would have the upper hand. However, full credit must go to The Thinker, who, giving a stone, battled all the way to the line and was beaten only one length. Arthur Stephenson thought that his 1987 Gold Cup winner would need the race and 20-1 about him repeating the feat at Cheltenham again looks good each-way value. McConnochie, who trains at Stratford-on-Avon and was formerly assistant to the now retired Mercy Rimell, said: \\u2018I think Golden Friend is an exciting prospect for the National.\\u2019 This was McConnochie's third success in his career and he gave a hint that there may be more to come in the Hennessy at Newbury on Saturday, saying: \\u2018Gala's Image should run well as long as the ground is not sticky.\\u2019 With Bigsun missing the Hennessy, Richard Dunwoody replaces John White on Brown Windsor, the 5-2 favourite. David Elsworth is still looking for a jockey for Ghofar. The Elsworth stable had good news regarding Barnbrook Again, who worked with all his old zest yesterday and will run in the North Street Chase at Newbury on Saturday. Martin Pipe has a tremendous record at Haydock. The Wellington trainer, who has a strike rate of just over 37 per cent at the Lancashire course, landed a double there yesterday with all-the-way winners Tri Folene and Star's Delight, and it would come as no surprise if he doubled that score today. He could well land the opening three races with Royal Wonder, Pertemps Network and Huntworth, while Star's Delight can make it two wins in as many days by taking the Rainford Conditional Jockeys Handicap Chase. Royal Wonder (1.00) is in cracking form. She completed a hat-trick with a 12 lengths victory over previous scorer Milleone at Nottingham last month and should prove too sharp for her rivals in the Northern Junior Hurdle. Pertemps Network (1.30) has frightened off all but two rivals in the Makerfield Novice Chase. The five-year-old won eight of his ten hurdles races last season and looks the ideal type to do extremely well over fences. After throwing away certain victory at Ascot, Huntworth (2.00) gained consolation with a two lengths win over Glenside Jerry at Devon two weeks ago. This fine jumper is fanced to end the winning sequences of both Nautical Joke and Conclusive in the Save And Propser Handicap Chase. At Wincanton Imperial Brush (1.45) is awarded the nap in the Wessex Handicap. He ran well when third to Highland Bounty in a hot handicap at Cheltenham recently. Motor Sport: Toyota take a Short cut. By Mike Greasley SAVIOURS come in many forms. Today Toyota are pinning their hopes on Phil Short, a 45-year-old Yorkshireman from Ilkley. Short, who actually stands 6ft 6in tall, could prove the key to Spain's Carlos Sainz winning his first Lombard RAC Rally for Toyota. Short was co-driver for the British hope David Llewellin, but on Tuesday their British-prepared Toyota Celica crashed out of the five-day, 2,000-mile event. Last night, however, Short received a phone call. The British team co-ordinator Alistair Roberts explained: \\u2018Nobody knows Yorkshire better than Phil. It's worth getting him involved. His knowledge could be crucial.\\u2019 Sainz could have done with him yesterday, when his lead was slashed by a charging Pentti Airikkala. On wind and rainswept stages in the rugged Border country, the Mitsubishi driver was fastest on nine of the day's 10 stages. The 27-year-old from Madrid had started yesterday's penultimate leg with a comfortable lead of 1min 36sec, but when he arrived at Newcastle last night it had been trimmed to 31sec. Enter Short. Today's final 78 miles of stages are over the notoriously deceptive Yorkshire forest roads. With long straights and blind brows often hiding corners, experience counts for a lot. With more than 20 years of rallying behind him, Short could give Sainz, or more importantly his co-driver Luis Moya, extra information which could make all the difference between winning, losing, or, even worse, crashing. Moya is on only his second RAC. Sainz is doing his third. \\u2018Last year was my first \\u2018blind\\u2019 rally, the first without having practised the stages,\\u2019said Moya. \\u2018I thoroughly enjoyed it but felt five years older after the experience.\\u2019 Compare this with Airikkala. He has won four international rallies based on today's RAC stages and has been rallying almost exclusively in Britain since 1975. Airikkala, 44, has even forsaken his native Finland to live in Britain. Airikkala's Irish co-driver Ronan McNamee knows the forests equally well, but points out that trying to read the roads from a map is not so easy, particularly at speeds of up to 130mph. \\u2018Sometimes it works fine but other times it's a complete mess,\\u2019 said McNamee. \\u2018But we do know Yorkshire well. \\u2018We wanted to start the final day within a minute of Carlos. Obviously we believe we can make up the time on roads we have been over quite a few times.\\u2019 The pressure is all on Sainz, known as \\u2018The Matador\\u2019 for his attacking and courageous driving style. A former Spanish junior squash champion, he is one of a new breed of southern European drivers challenging the traditional domination of the Finns and Swedes. The leading British driver is Malcolm Wilson, whose Opel was just out of the top 10 last night in 11th place, two minutes ahead of Gwyndaf Evans in his Ford Sierra in 12th place. Scotland's Jimmy McRae was an unlucky 13th after surviving transmission problems and a brush with a bridge in his Ford. Nottingham Forest 1, Everton 0 Tyson at centre of new controversy. By David Lacey THE Littlewoods Cup holders returned to the last eight of the competition last night in unusual and, Everton would claim, unjust circumstances. Nottingham Forest had almost despaired of breaking down Everton's rebuilt defence when Lee Chapman won an entertaining fourth-round tie at the City Ground with a smartly taken goal seven minutes from the end. While there was nothing extraordinary about the goal itself, Chapman turning the ball in at the near post after Clough had driven an indirect free-kick low through a crowd of players, the circumstances in which the kick had been given were a little odd and left Everton looking apoplectic. Neville Southall, whose saves had prevented Forest running away with the game in the first half, gathered the ball and started to think about clearing it but in the view of the referee, George Tyson, he had thought too long. A bemused Southall found himself cautioned for time-wasting and a few seconds later had to pick the ball out of the net. Not for the first time this season Tyson needed a police escort at the end as he was surrounded by protesting players. Colin Harvey, the Everton manager, ushered his team away. The TV playback showed that Southall had held the ball for 13 seconds, although it did not seem as long at the time. Harvey said later that he thought the decision had been harsh and added that there had been no warning given about time-wasting before the game, although he accepted that Tyson could have mentioned it to the players during the match, a fact confirmed by the referee as he left the ground. Just over a fortnight ago two of Tyson's more controversial penalty decisions had help spark a free-for-all at the end of the League match between Arsenal and Norwich City which led to both clubs being charged with bringing the game into disrepute. On the balance of last night's play, Everton were entitled to feel that they had done enough to take Forest back to Goodison Park. Although they were still deprived by injury of their regular central defenders Ratcliffe and Watson, they managed to defend efficiently by using Snodin as a spare centre-back behind Keown and McDonald. Even this appeared unlikely to stop Nottingham Forest in the first half. Hodge and Parker commanded the midfield, Crosby and Rice, strongly supported by Laws and Pearce, drove forward on the flanks and it seemed only a matter of time before the right sort of cross reached Chapman or Clough. Nottingham Forest later lost their momentum and McCall and Sheedy were now able to establish lasting contact with Newell and Sharp. Crossley had to move quickly to save a glancing header from Sharp and just when it looked as if Forest might be more grateful for a replay Chapman won the tie. Just what constitutes time-wasting is a matter for the referee's discretion, and if Tyson felt that Southall was deliberately using up precious seconds he was entitled to award Forest that crucial free-kick. But everybody knows that, in other games at other times with oter referees, goalkeepers will dally and dawdle to a greater degree and get away with it. To be effective this kind of refereeing has to be consistent. Otherwise the letter of the law is an ass. Nottingham Forest: Crossley; Laws, Pearce, Walker, Chettle, Hodge, Crosby, Parker, Clough, Chapman, Rice. Everton: Southall; McDonald, Pointon, Keown, Snodin, Ebbrell, Nevin (Cottee, 85min), McCall, Sharp, Newell, Sheedy. Referee: G Tyson (Sunderland).. Welling swelling. ON A night of Littlewoods Cup upsets it was left to Welling to perform similar derring-do in the FA Cup, writes Jack Massarik. A first-half header from their former Crystal Palace defender Mark Hone saw off Gillingham, their near neighbours of the Fourth Division, 1-0 in a first-round replay. It was the GM Vauxhall Conference side's first win over League opposition. Fulham became London's sole representatives in the second round when they beat Bath 2-1 at Craven Cottage. When Gary Smart gave the Beazer Homes League side the lead things looked bleak for a team winless for 11 games, but John Marshall and John Watson sealed a determined victory. The recalled Torquay striker Jimmy Smith celebrated his 20th birthday with two goals in three minutes during a 4-0 win which dashed Sutton's hopes of another upset. Phil Lloyd headed the opening goal. Dartford's hopes also crumbled rapidly when Exeter scored three times in an eight-minute spell in the second half. The Fourth Division side ran out 4-1 winners. Colin Johnson scored Dartford's consolation goal. Burnley came from behind to beat Stockport 2-1 at Edgeley Park and could thank their new signing Ron Futcher for the equaliser after Edwards had given the home side the lead. O'Connell seized on a bad back-pass to lob the winner. In the Littlewoods Cup two goals by Derby's McMinn disposed of West Bromwich Albion, and Manchester City's misery continued when Coventry put them out with a 16th-minute goal from Regis after a Redmond error. Rangers, beaten 1-0 by Aberdeen last night, yesterday announced a \\u00a35 million sponsorship, the biggest in British football, but declined to name their backer until the deal is signed. Their Glasgows rivals Celtic were held to a 1-1 draw by St Mirren. Sailing: Leaders neck and neck. By Bob Fisher in Fremantle THE leading yachts on the second leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race were almost in line abreast yesterday as they approached the finish here. Fisher & Paykel was the most northerly of the line, which ranged through Steinlager 2, Rothmans and Merit to the south-east. With 450 miles to go, an area of high pressure will decide the finishing order. The New Zealanders Grant Dalton and Peter Blake, skippers of Fisher & Paykel and Steinlager 2, agree that the winner will be decided in the final miles. \\u2018It's a matter of who has the right line past the high,\\u2019 said Dalton. Blake said: \\u2018Tacking the way through the lighter winds will decide who wins the leg.\\u2019 The yachts are slowing down as they approach Fremantle and the effect of the high-pressure zone becomes apparent. Fisher & Paykel was the first to be affected as speeds dropped from more than 11 knots to only eight. Athletics. Tony Morrell dashed Steve Cram's hopes yesterday when he informed the AAA that he would be fit to compete for England in the Commonwealth Games 1500 metres. Tennis.

Monty Wright landed the decisive win in England's 6-5 victory over Poland in the amateur international at HMS Nelson, Portsmouth, last night \\u2014 a unanimous points triumph over Jan Kopreckocaika \\u2014 in front of the England Commonwealth Games selectors. He will be hoping his performance will earn him a place in the 10-strong squad for New Zealand in January. Mark Edwards, the ABA middleweight champion already in the Auckland squad, also won the vote of all three judges against Robert Buda, but the England captain Richie Woodhall got through only on a majority decision against his fellow Olympic bronze medal winner at light-middleweight.

At a meeting in Frankfurt the West German Federation refused steadfastly to bow to mounting pressure from the Grand Slam committee to sanction the cup. \\u2018We believe it is bad for German tennis,\\u2019 the West German Federation's chairman, Claus Stauder, said in Essen yesterday. \\u2018They tried everything to convince us but we didn't buy it. They clearly didn't expect we would stand firm.\\u2019 The Grand Slam committee, including the chairman of the Wimbledon committee Buzzer Hadingham, and the International Federation are now in the embarrassing situation of having their event outlawed by the most powerful federation in the game. Stauder referred to \\u2018this exorbitantly rewarded and grotesque event which gives the winner more prize money than Boris Becker has made this year\\u2019. He admitted the federation could not stop the tournament. \\u2018But we cannot and will not sanction it,\\u2019 he said. German fears are fourfold: uncontrollably escalating prize money; a form of financial saturation-bombing of the wealthiest tennis market in the world; downgrading of the German Open, which has a tradition stretching back 80 years; and a clash with the ATP finals scheduled for Frankfurt three weeks earlier. For Stauder, the solution may lie in a merger of the ATP finals and the Grand Slam Cup. Tranmere Rovers 2, Tottenham 2 Tranmere flying high in pursuit of another scalp. By Cynthia Bateman THE Tranmere Rovers players were so high on good publicity before this match that their manager, John King, said he would have to pull them down from the ceiling. Now they are going through the roof en route to the moon, having forced Spurs into a replay. Terry Venables was left picking his side up off the floor. The Third Division front-runners, who had already knocked Millwall out of this competition and have not lost at home for 12 months, refused to be intimidated, then turned the tables. Spurs have never been the same in cup competition since Port Vale knocked them out of the FA Cup. But Venables had promised that his men would be made of sterner stuff this time, and their first-half guile and style foiled Tranmere's honest endeavours. On the half-hour Gascoigne, put through by Thomas, meandered through the open gate of Tranmere's back yard to take the lead with a low, hard shot into the right-hand corner. Tranmere wasted a good deal of splendid midfield work in the first half with long-range speculative shots into the stand. But six minutes into the second half their central defender Vickers, who appeared to be standing several yards offside, received a pass from Bishop and his close-range shot levelled the score. A petulant Gascoigne tried by fair means and foul, to his own discredit, to twirl the Tranmere defence, but it was the sleek performance of Lineker, playing deep, that provided the few chances Spurs had. Both Samways and Allen brought fine saves from Nixon, and Samways had a goal disallowed. But Tranmere, cocky even before the equaliser, played with skill and tenacity. They took the lead when Steel headed in Hughes's perfect cross as Spurs' formation began to look as ragged as a returning Battle of Britain squadron. Spurs' humiliation was compounded when Lineker mis-kicked wildly a few feet in front of goal and fell flat on his back. It looked as though Spurs had regained their self-respect a few seconds later when the England striker appeared to net a Samways cross, but in fact Tranmere's full-back Higgins had put the ball past his goalkeeper. VIPs in the crowd of 13,789 retired to the Tranmere Suite, where the scroll of memorable matches includes Tranmere's 1-1 draw with Spurs in a 1953 FA Cup tie. What it does not mention is that the little club from the wrong side of the Mersey crashed out 9-1 in the replay, their worst defeat. Tranmere Rovers: Nixon; Higgins, Pike, Bishop, Hughes, Vickers, Morrissey (Malkin, 71min), Harvey, Steel, Muir, Mungall. Tottenham Hotspur: Thorstvedt; Thomas, Polston, Bergsson (Stevens, 69), Howells, Mabbutt, Samways, Gascoigne, Stewart (Walsh, 80), Lineker, Allen. Referee: L Shapter (Torquay).. Tranmere Rovers 2, Tottenham 2 Spurs tossed a lifeline. By Cynthia Bateman TRANMERE ROVERS, of the Third Division, forced a replay against a shaken Spurs side who were rescued by a Higgins own goal in the 69th minute of this Littlewoods Cup fourth-round tie. Rovers have never been the same since they knocked Newcastle and Wimbledon out of the Centenary Trophy. Their manager, John King, said his players were so high on publicity that before this match he had to pull them down from the ceiling. Terry Venables was left picking his players up off the floor after Tranmere, who have not lost at Prenton Park in 12 months, achieved a worthy draw against their lofty visitors. The Tottenham manager had said that his team would be tougher than the ones that were overturned by Port Vale and Bradford in notorious FA Cup defeats, and better than the one that struggled against Southend in an earlier round of this competition. But it was Spurs' guile rather than their aggression that earned them a first-half lead when Thomas put Gascoigne through. He was able to meander past the Tranmere defence and finish with a low hard shot that spun past Nixon's outstretched hands. Gascoigne, appearing riled by some of the rough-and-tumble of Tranmere's enthusiasm, teased and toyed with their defence, beating one, two and three defenders, only to fall foul of three more when a simple pass would have done the business. Lineker showed him how it is done, playing deep and feeding Samways and Allen with slick passes that brought two excellent saves from Nixon, a disallowed goal by Samways, and a reaction from the Tranmere defence which was somewhat reminiscent of a metal crusher in a scrapyard. But Tranmere were not all hustle and bustle. They had their moments of flair but they wasted good midfield work with speculative shots into the stand. Only one, a volley by Muir \\u2014 released by Venables when he was manager of Queen's Park Rangers \\u2014 caused Thorstvedt any anxiety. Six minutes into the second half, Tranmere, always alert and certainly never overawed, equalised through a shot from their central defender Vickers who, viewed from the stand, looked offside by several yards. Tranmere now were not only confident but cocky, and as Spurs deteriorated into a formation as ragged as a returning Battle of Britain squadron it was the Third Division side who found space and time. In the 62nd minute Hughes crossed perfectly for Steel to head them into the lead. A mis-kick in front of goal by Lineker compounded Spurs' humiliation. But seconds later both the England striker and his team recovered their self respect when he netted a Samways cross \\u2014 although it finally went down as an own goal by Higgins. Tranmere Rovers: Nixon; Higgins, Pike, Bishop, Hughes, Vickers, Morrissey, Harvey, Steel, Muir, Mungall. Tottenham Hotspur: Thorstvedt; Thomas, Polston, Bergsson, Howells, Mabbutt, Samways, Gascoigne, Stewart, Lineker, Allen. Referee: L Shapter (Torquay).. West Ham 1, Wimbledon 0 Dicks sent off, five booked on night of the steamers. By Ian Ridley AMESSY match disgraced by a series of violent tackles and subsequent scenes of inflamed confrontations between players was, quite out of context, settled by a breathtaking goal by Martin Allen 10 minutes from time. West Ham had their captain Julian Dicks sent off and four other players were booked, as well as the Wimbledon physiotherapist. Just when you thought it was safe to watch another Wimbledon game\\u2026 Their disciplinary record has slowly improved under Bobby Gould and they will point out, correctly, that West Ham played as great a part in the mayhem. That cannot excuse them, however, and the FA will probably be interested in both teams' excuses. It was the third time in three weeks that such ugly scenes had been witnessed at London grounds. The referee, Alfred Buksh, who rarely had control of a game that at one point seemed unlikely to be completed, booked Wimbledon's Phelan, Wise, Young and the physiotherapist, Steve Allen, for treating an injured player without permission, and West Ham's Allen and Dicks, before his dismissal. Forty three minutes of crass, artless thumping of a ball, just shaded by Wimbledon by virtue of Young's header being cleared off the line by Keen, preceded the first flare-up. Wise fouled Dicks near a touchline and the West Ham left back responded with a retaliatory elbow. Young led, in terrace parlance, the steaming in, which at one stage involved at least 10 players with punches appearing to be thrown. The nearby crowd surged forward and police had to intervene. Only Wise was cautioned \\u2014 Phelan's earlier had been, curiously, for delaying a throw-in \\u2014 and the referee missed an opportunity to establish his authority. Five minutes into the second half Allen challenged Young late and this time Sanchez led the steamers, closely followed by Dicks. This time Allen and Dicks were cautioned, Allen fortunate not to be shown a red card as he harangued the referee. Another posse gathered around the referee in the 56th minute after Young's high challenge on Allen, for which the Wimbledon defender was booked. Yet another occurred four minutes later after Dicks's scything tackle on Wise, for which a sending-off could be the only outcome. All this was \\u2018played\\u2019 to a backdrop of police ejecting incensed supporters from terrace and stand. The referee, who needed a police escort from the pitch, was pelted with missiles as he spoke to an officer. His refusal of a penalty when Allen was fouled by Curle made matters worse, but he was correct in ruling that Brady had already fouled Segers. Slater also had a shot cleared off the line by Joseph. Poor Brady, a ballet dancer in a bearpit. And then there was Devonshire, who at least attempted to get West Ham going. The hype surrounding Justin v John Fashanu did not materialise but Justin came on, only to miss from a few yards as Sanchez intervened, leading to his injury and the booking of the Wimbledon physio. Finally a goal came. Slater sent Ward away on the left and his cross was met by Allen who unleashed a stunning volley into the net of which Marco van Basten would hve been proud. Even then, Cork had a late chance to equalise but screwed his shot wide. \\u2018There were four or five incidents which nobody is pleased to see,\\u2019 admitted Gould. \\u2018I will be dealing with it in-house.\\u2019 His West Ham counterpart, Lou Macari, was less open. \\u2018I want to avoid it,\\u2019 he said of the \\u2018little incidents\\u2019, but, when pressed, added: \\u2018You can't control footballers on the field.\\u2019 Neither are West Ham fans likely to agree with his saying: \\u2018Our supporters are only interested in us getting into the next round.\\u2019 West Ham: Parkes; Potts, Dicks, Strodder, Martin, Keen (Fashanu, 70min), Brady, Slater, Allen, Ward, Parris,(Devonshire, 41). Wimbledon: Segers; Joseph, Phelan, Ryan, Young, Curle, Fairweather, Cotterill, Miller (Cork, 75), Sanchez (Scales, 70), Wise. Referee: A Buksh (London).\",\n          \"The guest house, in Stockbridge, is being organised by the Edinburgh Community Trust on a commercial basis. According to the trust's Andy Hunter, the aim is not to treat or rehabilitate people but give them an opportunity to work. Lord Fraser said the project reflected the Government's aim of providing help more suited to individual needs. \\u2018The Government is determined that as many people as possible with mental health problems live in the community. With correct support, confidence and independence can be gained and health and quality of life improved,\\u2019 he added. Preaching to the despairing with shock tactics Father James Morrow makes no apology for his uncompromising attitude when he feels it could help to save lives. Frank Urquhart meets the controversial pro-life activist FOUR days ago a diminutive figure dressed in black called at the Yorkshire home of Allan and Barbara Bland, parents of the Hillsborough disaster victim, Tony Bland. Standing on the step was Father James Morrow, the Roman Catholic priest and pro-life activist who has threatened to bring a private prosecution for murder against the anguished couple if their son is allowed to die. Father Morrow felt it his duty to try to appeal face to face to Tony's parents to allow their son to live. Time and again he has used persuasion \\u2014 and on occasion shock tactics \\u2014 to try to prevent young girls having abortions. He carries a picture taken by anti-abortionists that depicts the decapitated head of a fully formed foetus, recovered from a rubbish bin behind a clinic in New York. Father Morrow pointed to the harrowing photograph and said: \\u2018The Americans have been very assiduous in getting hold of the garbage after abortions. Sinners, prostitutes, and thieves can understand in a second the power of that argument. Sadly police, magistrates and MPs take a lot longer.\\u2019 He is convinced that abortion is evil and that the historic Lords ruling will open the floodgates to mercy killings and euthanasia. His campaign has led to him being held in two jails, Strangeways and Pentonville, and at least \\u00a32,000 in fines for public order offences which he stubbornly refuses to pay. Incarceration has been no barrier to his relentless campaign. \\u2018I just show the prisoners a picture of an aborted baby and I say to them if I had done that to a baby I deserve to be here, but what I am trying to do is prevent it happening.\\u2019 He wanted to tell the Blands that there were people willing to take care of their son for the rest of his life, if they would allow it. The door of their Leeds home, however, remained firmly closed. Father Morrow spoke yesterday of his visit to the Blands' home after returning to his base at Humanae Vitae House, a former 18th century Catholic chapel in the Deeside village of Braemar which has become the focus of his national campaign. He said: \\u2018People must not attempt to alleviate suffering by murder. There are all sorts of ways in which one can attempt to alleviate suffering but killing your son by any method, whether starvation or some quicker execution, is not among them. \\u2018I wanted to tell Tony Bland's parents that they will prolong their own suffering if they go ahead with this. It will eventually dawn on them that they have killed their son and they will suffer for that reason.\\u2019 He added: \\u2018Once they have got  euthanasia well under way it will be wholesale victory for the anti-God forces.\\u2019 Father Morrow, 58, a native of Paisley, arrived in Braemar in 1980 as a priest at the village's St Andrew's Church. Ten years later he quit as a parish priest to concentrate on his pro-life activities. His work with the pro-life movement had begun in 1966 with Sir David  Steel's Private Members Bill to legalise abortions. \\u2018I began campaigning there and then,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Abortion is inherently a total rejection of all that Christianity stands for. \\u2018Christianity says love God above all things and your neighbour as yourself. Abortion says love God if you like, love the neighbour you can see, but there is absolutely no need to love your unborn neighbours \\u2014 you can do them to death with impunity.\\u2019 Father Morrow is uncompromising in his stand against abortion. There is, he states, no justification for killing an innocent unborn  child under any  circumstances , whether the mother has been the victim of rape or her own life  is threatened by her pregnancy. \\u2018It is not possible to draw a line between human and human and say some do and some do not have the right to life,\\u2019 he said. For almost a decade he has led a series of protest demonstrations outside abortion clinics throughout England, running foul of the law on countless occasions. Last year, he claimed, as many as 70 girls were persuaded not to have abortions. DEREK IRONSIDE Campaigner: Father James Morrow at the former 18th century Catholic chapel in Braemar which has become the base for his national campaign As at the last general election, and under the UK system of government, Labour, with 39 per cent of the vote, has 68 per cent of the Scottish parliamentary seats, whereas the SNP, with 21.5 per cent of the vote, has 4 per cent of the seats. As we don't have PR this clearly gives Labour the mandate \\u2018to put up or shut up\\u2019, to quote Gerry Hassan (Points of View, 9 February). John Smith, who has aspirations to be prime minister of the UK, has stated that the Tories have no mandate in Scotland to privatise water. On the basis of this argument, however, were Labour to win the next election on the numerical strength of MPs returned from Scotland, he would then have to agree that Labour have no mandate in England! In my view, the positions of the SNP and Labour are  irreconcilable in spite of MP John McAllion's apparent attempt to draw parallels. In fact the distinctions are obvious, between Labour's Scottish parliament within the UK and the SNP's vision of a nation state in Europe. Smoked out An extraordinary new species has been sighted in the centre of Edinburgh recently. It appears to favour grouping on city pavements outside office blocks and is most commonly seen around mid-morning or between 12 noon and 2pm. It scuttles out of office doorways with a desperateness that is quickly dispelled by sucking on a white, smoking cylinder. I believe it has been identified as the \\u2018puffout\\u2019, a distance cousin of our old favourite, the \\u2018puffin\\u2019. It has been forced to reveal itself due to strict new regulations for healthier office environments and appears quite harmless! Potholes on the road to democracy WELL, Happy Anniversary. It's now exactly two months since the morning after the march before. And have our esteemed political classes had a meaningful meeting? Is the road to Scottish-style democracy and a Scottish parliament just plain littered with members of opposing parties linking arms and striding towards the new tomorrow? Well, ahem, not exactly. But for all that and all that there have been some interesting stirrings in the undergrowth which may well have the effect of concentrating the minds of the opposition party leaders. This morning for instance the Scottish executive of the people's party will have an opportunity to examine the fruits of some of the labours of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which has been functioning as the honest broker following the swiftly evaporating euphoria of the 25,000 souls who turned up on 12 December. Some of the thinking which has emerged underlines the impatience of the Scottish electorate with the party spokespeople who claim to have their best interests at heart. It's clear that the many non-party political groups which sprang up in the wake of the election, bodies such as Common Cause and Scotland United, are now prepared to work together in a coalition to stage further events highlighting the deficiencies of the current constitutional arrangements. At the moment they are prepared to work with the political parties in keeping up the momentum December generated, but it's clear they intend to progress with their agenda whether or not the formal politicians continue to drag their feet. In the immediate term they're determined that there should be no vacuum following publication of the results of the government's stocktaking of the Scottish condition, expected later this month. To that end they plan a brief conference on the first Saturday after any pronouncement. The opposition parties will be invited to make individual contributions on that day, and to send a small number of delegates. Neither are the civic groupings planning to hang around much longer waiting for an inter-party meeting to establish common ground and communal tactics. A civic-led summit is also on the spring agenda. There are also all manner of other plans involving not just pan-Scottish events to allow a wider constituency to respond to the implications of the democracy march, but initiatives which will flag up Scottish concerns across the European parliamentary scene. At this juncture you may just have noticed a slight differential in pace between the \\u2018amateurs\\u2019 in this democracy game, and the alleged professionals. Spot the ditherers and win a cash prize. Though it would be fair in this instance to absolve the Scottish Liberal Democrats from charges of time-wasting. Jim Wallace has also been active in trying to put together a political format with which both Labour and the Scottish Nationalist leaders can live. For behind the public posturings, there's no doubt that both of these gentlemen have been having more than a little local difficulty with their respective parties. Mr Salmond has to appear pure in heart to his diehard fundamentalists by never again having truck with four letter words like devolution. There is also the small matter of resolving the conundrum of targeting Labour-held seats in an electoral context while standing on common ground over matters such as the taking of stock. The water privatisation saga provides a useful metaphor for the greater debate within Labour and SNP ranks. In theory, both are as one in opposing water passing from public ownership and control. In practice they are at daggers drawn as the furore over Tom Clarke's pronouncements on the subject this week amply illustrates. Yet it is precisely that kind of issue that the coalition would like addressed in a coherent and collaborative fashion. Tom Clarke, meanwhile, has to persuade a hard core in his own party that acting in concert with the SNP on certain occasions does not equate to dancing with wolves. In essence that has been his difficulty over responding positively to the clarion cry made in December for a recall of the Scottish parliament. Whatever his views on the subject, Labour's Scottish leader is not in the market for appearing to waltz to any tune called by his Nationalist counterpart. But these issues, which so often seem to dominate the debate in Scotland at party political level, are frankly of little moment to the electorate at large. Most voters wish a fraction of the energy expended on internecine warfare between fellow opposition parties could be expended in opposing those aspects of Government policy they feel are detrimental to Scotland's future. But even in the midst of these minefields, assiduous efforts have been made to fashion a safe passageway. A formula has been devised where instead of any attempts at recalling the Scottish parliament, the three parties convene their own summit as a parliamentary forum for debate on issues such as future water and sewerage delivery. If strenuous attempts were also made to involve Scottish business in a real debate, then the mixture of the council and the coalition could be said to reflect a pretty broad national consensus. This would, in effect, finally sound the death knell for the Convention. But then it was a creature of its time, and its time and the work it did were about the last election, not the next one. I suspect that is now the view of the Liberal Democrats, so if Labour were to hang on trying to breathe life into the corpse while the Democrats tiptoed from the funeral parlour, then it would lose all legitimacy as a multi-party device. If Labour's executive  brethren are also disposed to look at new options and new deals today they will doubtless incur some internal wrath. If they don't, they will find the attention of the electorate turning to fresh pastures anyway. Tree planting Steve Rodrick's comments (Points of View, 4 February), together with those of John Palmer today, on recent progress made by the Central Scotland Woodlands Countryside Trust help to shed some light on the difficulties faced by the organisation. Institutional problems are one thing; the problem of interfacing with local communities quite another. Both Mr Rodrick and Mr Palmer briefly mention that the local people should have a say, presumably in the planning and implementation of the community forest, but the mechanics of how this will come about are far from clear. With the best will in the world by all involved agencies, environmental transformation, through the planting of trees in the central belt, will only become a realistic objective when the support of landowners and local people is enlisted. While it would be churlish to pass over the considerable tree planting effort already wrought in the central belt by the trust, the results of a three-year research project undertaken at the University of Edinburgh reveal little evidence that the needs and wants of local people have provided the vehicle for environmental change. As a result, as far as farmers are concerned tree planting has not been integrated into their work patterns or land management, nor has it led to enhanced levels of interest among previous participants. Significantly, much confusion has derived from the apparently different economic and social priorities set by government employees, other planners, conservationists and farmers. If local communities in towns and villages are to be involved in tree planting and management, governing institutions need to summon their interest by ensuring that individuals will know how they will benefit from involvement. Farmers in the region are deeply committed to their livelihoods, stock and crops. Transfer of such commitment to trees and woodlands would be necessary to ensure the successful promotion of the community forest. It would require, furthermore, that the current apathy among farmers towards tree planting proposals, which stems from, among other things, economic constraints, lack of confidence in the future of farming and the social hiatus between farmers and their urban neighbours, be addressed at source. Vision is hardly the word that I would have used when considering John Smith's speech, reported on your front page (8 February). He, like the rest of us, has seen the effects on this country of 14 years of continuous Tory rule, resulting in the present economic chaos and farce. His only solution, that he now offers, is to adopt those self-same Tory policies. Clearly there must be something in the water at Westminster which inevitably drives all our politicians into the realms of fantasy! Heartening May we congratulate the Scottish Office on two recent crucial decisions in the cultural sector, first, in increasing the grant to the Scottish Film Council and Film Production Fund by over \\u00a3300,000, and secondly, in announcing a \\u00a3300,000 annual grant to the crafts in Scotland. In case anyone should question these financial allocations, can we point out that they only move the film and crafts sectors towards the level of support long enjoyed in England and Wales. SALVO began campaigning on these issues in 1989. Since then, meetings, election arts manifesto commitments, letters to ministers and MPs and information to film and crafts workers to develop their own pressure points have all been sustained, as bulging files show! Now, five years later, the battles are won (significant skirmishes remain, but it would be unwise and ungenerous to detail them at this point). This basic message is heartening for democracy. If there is a sound case which can be backed up by facts, if one is willing to be patient, determined and constructive, then politicians will listen and can be persuaded. Britain's secret society MARK FISHER ON 19 February, MPs will vote on whether Britain should have a freedom of information act. The Right to Know Bill, which I am introducing in the House of Commons, would lift the blanket of official secrecy that so often keeps us in the dark. Take safety. After many of the recent disasters we later learned that the authorities knew there was a problem all along \\u2014 but the public didn't. In 1985 more than 50 people died in a fire at Bradford City Football Club. Later it was discovered that the council had written to the club months earlier demanding action to deal with the hazard. But the correspondence was confidential. After the  Marchioness river boat sank in the Thames in 1989 it was revealed that the ship that crashed into it \\u2014 the Bowbelle \\u2014 had been involved in three previous river accidents. The accident reports had been kept secret. After the 1987 fire at Kings Cross underground station which killed 31 people, the official inquiry reported: \\u2018Many of the shortcomings\\u2026had in fact been identified before by the internal inquiries into escalator fires. They were also highlighted in reports by the fire brigade, police, and Railway Fire Prevention and Fire Safety Standards Committee.\\u2019 No-one knows whether openness could have prevented these tragedies. But if the public had known about the problems, they could have demanded improvements \\u2014 and something might have been done. We should be able to see the files held on us by public authorities \\u2014 to check that they are accurate and fair. But most of them are confidential. We can see what has been written on our medical records after November 1991 \\u2014 but have no right to the earlier information. Nor can we see our social security or employment records. The Government refuses to publish reports showing whether the tobacco industry is keeping to the voluntary agreements that restrict tobacco advertising near schools. We cannot see the official tests showing which cars cause least pollution or have the best safety features. Ministers refuse to publish the list of environmentally sensitive areas which RAF pilots are told to avoid during low flying exercises. The penalties handed down by police disciplinary hearings are secret. The Iraqgate affair demonstrates how secrecy lets Government get away with dangerous dishonesty. Ministers relaxed the guidelines on the exports of arms equipment to Iraq, but kept the new policy secret, to avoid criticism. Three businessmen were then prosecuted for selling Iraq machine tools for making weapons \\u2014 but confidential documents showed that they had told ministers what they were doing and had been encouraged to carry on. One of them was actually working for the intelligence services. Yet the prosecution went ahead and ministers tried to suppress these documents. Unbelievably, the court was told that they would not help the defence case \\u2014 a demonstrable falsehood that could have landed the three in jail. Not just the quality of public debate, but even our liberty, may depend on the right to know. Britain is one of the few democracies that still doesn't have a freedom of information act. American, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, France, Denmark, Holland, Norway and Greece all have them \\u2014 Sweden has had one for more than 200 years. Often we can learn more about Britain under the American information law than we can from Whitehall. The Right to Know Bill would open up the files of government and official bodies. Of course some information should be secret. The bill protects details of people's private lives, and information which could harm defence, law enforcement or genuine commercial secrets. It also amends the Official Secrets Act to allow someone who had been prosecuted to argue that releasing information was in the public interest. It would give people the right to see their employment records. And it would force companies to say in their annual reports whether they had broken laws on consumer protection, safety, the environment and discrimination. The bill has the backing of MPs of all parties \\u2014 but it is vital that they actually support it in the Commons on 19 February. If you care about your right to know, ask your MP to vote for it. Tom jumps in at the deep end THE Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland has two demanding and very often unrewarding jobs. As effective leader of the Scottish Labour Party, he has to weld that frequently fissiparous organisation together, to set his stamp on its policies for Scotland, and to campaign against the Government, adopting a high profile for himself and the opposition. As shadow secretary, he has a duty in the House of Commons to cross-question his opposite number and to turn a relentless searchlight on his public pronouncements. In both of these roles he is himself exposed to close scrutiny at the hands of other politicians and the media. as if this was not enough, Tom Clarke, newly returned to politics after illness, has another difficulty, which is to represent a party in the process of remodelling itself. His leader, John Smith, has announced a conversion from the traditional Labour policy towards state control of industry to one in which the question of ownership is \\u2018largely irrelevant.\\u2019 It was not, therefore, surprising to find Mr Clarke somewhat exposed when facing some pressing questions on BBC Scotland about Labour's plans for returning water to public hands at some point in the future. Instead of gently deflecting the point, he conceded that removing private companies might be hard to do. Aha! said Mr Clarke's critics (and there are a few around), a clear betrayal of Labour's commitment, an act of treachery, an exposure of Labour's essential hypocrisy, etc. That was all fairly predictable, and unlikely to prove of lasting damage. Mr Clarke is not, after all, the first, nor will he be the last politician to find himself caught on the hop by a shrewd interviewer. However, the shadow secretary's remarks to the Scottish Trade Unions for Labour in Glasgow last Friday may take a little more explaining. This after all was a prepared speech. In it he said that the Scottish financial sector did nothing to help the country's economy, that it benefited only a selected minority, and that it put little back into Scotland. This is a fairly staggering claim, not least for the 200,000 odd people employed by an industry which has expanded to the point where Scotland is currently the second biggest financial centre in the EC. Even ignoring its importance as a local employer, to say that a sector which earns 15 per cent of GDP, which finances most of the small business start-ups in Scotland, which provides capital for companies great and small, which finances pensions and insurance for thousands of Scots, as well as backing for a quarter of the UK's institutional funds, does nothing to help the economy, is to carry ideology to the point of folly. More than this, however, it devalues Edinburgh's reputation for probity in financial dealings which is a vital counterbalance to some of the excesses of the City of London. Another statement of \\u2018clarification\\u2019 may well be in order from Mr Clarke and his advisers. Shadow boxing THE apparent squabble between the South African government and the ANC over the precise nature of their agreement on the immediate political future is more show than anything else. Having reached a consensus on the shape of the interim administration, which is to steer the country to full democracy, and what that democracy should look like, they have come under pressure from the others involved in the stalled multi-party discussions about South Africa's future. Now President de Klerk and the ANC leadership are trying to tone down the outcome of the talks in order not to appear to have pre-empted a decision before the others have had a chance to have their say. If one looks behind what is being said by both sides, there is in fact little that divides them. It is more a question of terminology than anything else. While the government negotiator Fanus Schoeman insists that the ANC has agreed to share power because a government of national unity is power-sharing, the ANC leader Nelson Mandela said on Saturday that an interim government of national unity was not power-sharing and that the body would include all parties who have won a certain proportion of seats in a constituent assembly. But that is what Shoeman indicated as well. Indeed, a similar interpretation was put forward by President de Klerk yesterday when he said that there had been no firm agreement on power-sharing and stressed the need for the resumption of multi-party talks. With convergence also on the issue of regional autonomy, it is hard to see what all the fuss and bother is about. However, with an eye to the other organisations, the sound of pedals being rotated backwards has been deafening. Already de Klerk has emphasised that Inkatha participation in any negotiations is fundamental to the process, following dire threats of political violence \\u2014 not to be discounted \\u2014 from its leader, Chief Buthelezi. At the same time Mandela's remarks indicate that he, too, recognises the need to involve all the parties in the democracy negotiations if they really are to be democratic. Realistically, it has to be recognised that without some sort of consensus between the two largest players, the government and the ANC, about key points, the talks would have been doomed anyway. Having clearly sorted out most of their substantial differences, these two must now return to the multi-party negotiations and ensure that all voices are heard and taken into account. School saviour finishes bottom of the clash Schooling in New York was in turmoil so Joseph Fernandez was appointed as a troubleshooter \\u2014 but strife was rife and he was sacked. Michael Pye reports JOSEPH Fernandez just sat there, his face sometimes reddening, all day. He is New York's schools chancellor, head of the public schools system, and he found himself last week on public trial. A man called him the devil, some parents shouted \\u2018We Want Joe\\u2019 and the talk was all about condoms, AIDS and innocence. When the evidence was in, the seven members of the board of education did what everyone knew they would. They fired the man who, two years before, was reckoned the finest educator in the United States. That was when Fernandez was hired from Miami for $195,000 a year and a basket of pension plans that would excite a baseball player. He was going to save New York's schools. Now nobody is quite sure they can be saved, not while such a huge organisation answers to this board of education. And with the top schools job vacant in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston, the fearful thought is this: can anyone at all save the schools of America's cities? The story is much the same in all four cities: social conservatives trying to push their ideas through school boards, parents frustrated that schools have fancy ideas but don't seem to teach children to figure, write or read. The combination is explosive. And Joseph Fernandez's old job has other complications: being second-guessed continuously by an unelected board of education that puts its small moral agenda above all else, sabotaged by the remains of corrupt school boards, starved of federal money and unable to settle on a contract with the teachers' union. The job was this. Fernandez was hired to end 20 years of chaos caused by decentralising New York's huge school system. The notion was that communities should have a say in what was taught, and the hidden agenda was to end the undeclared war between predominantly white and Jewish teachers, and an increasingly black and Hispanic body of pupils. The consequence was that good old New York tradition: cronyism, corruption and graft. Ads on the subways asked us to call a confidential hotline if we knew what crimes our local school board was committing. At the time half the city's school boards were distracted by criminal investigations \\u2014 into how a grand piano went home with a board member, how their election hand-outs came to be printed by school members on school presses, why others dealt drugs and what exactly was the price of a promotion ($10,000 could get you a deputy principalship in the Bronx). School board superintendents complained they had to hire the buddies, allies and nephews of board members. Others complained about the superintendents. Annie Wolinsky, who superintended Board 9 in the Bronx, left behind $13,000 worth of postage stamps hidden in a drawer, a warehouse stuffed with unreported supplies, eight staff members whose only job was to videotape board members on request, and a phone bill into the thousands of dollars which consisted mostly of calls to the various city porn lines. She also failed to notice the board had hired a teacher with convictions for exposing himself to schoolgirls, or ask why a probationary principal was still in place despite pleading guilty to a $21,000 welfare scam. At least she was spared the ignominy of the board in Washington Heights, in upper Manhattan, where a teacher was arrested in his schoolyard \\u2014 carrying cocaine, marijuana, valium and a switch-blade. Fernandez seemed the answer to this. He was a New Yorker, for a start, and a Puerto Rican. What he didn't say, until he published his autobiography last year, was that he was also a high school drop-out who'd been a heroin addict, a splendid example of rising out of the rot of the inner city. He took office on 2 January 1990 and within three weeks he'd demanded the right to approve the boards' choices for school superintendents, a notion which later fell foul of the courts. By March, he'd won the right to remove incompetent principals \\u2014 like the one in the Bronx who had been convicted of possessing crack cocaine. In October he felt strong enough, buoyed by public support, to tackle the mayor on the matter of budget cuts which, he claimed, would cripple the school system. Even his supporters began to notice something curious. Instead of lobbying at City Hall, he liked to turn up early to civic events and leave, ostentatiously, just before the mayor arrived. It wasn't political. It wasn't tactful. It turned out to be all too typical. The point was to chat, nudge, persuade. He refused to listen to Norman Adler, the political consultant hired by a local foundation; \\u2018He simply puts on his army boots and marches ahead,\\u2019 Adler says, regretfully. All this matters in a system with overlapping powers, with a tendency to divide Manhattan and its liberal politicians and the mayor from the concerns of the outer boroughs. Ironically, Fernandez was a brilliant lobbyist in Washington for more federal funds for New York schools, and he'll be sorely missed, but he couldn't find the time to play the politics of his own backyard. Worse, he didn't call in on schools. Whole sectors of the city never saw him. He did give power to schools and parents, but that made him enemies. He did try to give parents the right to choose a school for their children and not just accept the one that happened to be closest; this mattered, since property values soar where schools are good. He announced a significant improvement in city-wide maths scores in 1991, a decline in the drop-out rate from 20.8% to 17.2% which at least made a bad situation less appalling. But he missed something obvious. For years, social conservatives \\u2014 who may be fundamentalists, part of Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, good Catholics \\u2014 have seen school boards as a political powerbase, somewhere to challenge liberal orthodoxy on matters like queers, evolution and birth control. The board of education is appointed \\u2014 five members by the five borough presidents, two by the mayor \\u2014 and it's a wonderful place for politicians to win points by appointing the respectable and the conservative. In New York, the board could easily find allies. Schools aren't safe. A friend who teaches both in Brooklyn and at the jails on Rijkers Island says she feels far less secure in school. The journey to school can be a matter of daily terror in some areas. And these schools don't work too well. Reading scores are low, maths scores are low and the amount of repair work needed when kids get to college, if they do, is phenomenal. A drop-out rate of 17.2% is nothing to brag about, although Fernandez did. Add all this together and you have a formidable coalition of parents \\u2014 black, Hispanic, Asian as well as the mainly Catholic groups like the Italians and the Irish \\u2014 who want schools to be orderly, their children to be safe, the teaching to be orthodox and to concentrate on reading, writing and arithmetic. On 14 December 1990 Fernandez proposed to distribute condoms in schools without parental consent. He argued that the spread of AIDS among teenagers was too obvious and too wide for inaction. On 26 November, 1991, New York became the first American city to hand out condoms. We'll never know how many lives were saved, how many teenage pregnancies were avoided, how much sexually transmitted disease wasn't transmitted as a result. But we do know what enemies Chancellor Fernandez made. Fernandez was in trouble, but he didn't see it that way. He went on to propose a Rainbow Curriculum \\u2014 without actually reading it first \\u2014 which tried to teach tolerance for all, but in the process had to discuss homosexuality with kids of eight. The ceiling fell. One Queens school board refused to teach the curriculum. Gay activists and ladies with steel hair shouted each other down. On Thanksgiving last year, the borough president of Queens, Clare Shulman, called Fernandez to suggest an academic panel rework the Rainbow Curriculum, just to cool the issue. Days later, Fernandez suspended the Queens school board that refused his curriculum, and ten days after that the board of education reinstated them all. Fernandez back-pedalled on the Rainbow Curriculum, and waited for New York State to confirm that teachers couldn't be forced into spending half their time for sex education on counselling abstinence. But it wasn't enough. Everyone \\u2014 everyone who matters in Manhattan, that is \\u2014 says the system will have to change. Maybe each borough should run its own schools, maybe the mayor should have greater powers, maybe school districts could be small and autonomous. Someone's got to wipe out the graft and incompetence. Someone's got to allow teachers to teach, not act as glorified security guards. But if Fernandez can't do it, then who can? Joseph Fernandez: he was in trouble, but he didn't see it that way. He went on to propose a Rainbow Curriculum which tried to to discuss homosexuality with kids of eight Parents are frustrated that schools have fancy ideas but don't teach children to write or read Page 3 models and rubber fetishists with a slave on the side flickered before our very eyes Screen love: How was it for view? Anthony Troon spends St Valentine's Day \\u2014 or rather weekend \\u2014 in bed with his television AN INTERNATIONAL conference of sociologists and camp followers once defined love. It is: \\u2018the cognitive-affective state characterised by intrusive and obsessive fantasising concerning reciprocity of amorant feeling by the object of the amorance.\\u2019 I have a feeling that an international conference of television executives met some time later, hoping to improve on this. It came up with: \\u201826 hours 45 minutes of medium-to-low budget television, mostly played for laughs.\\u2019 As this Monday dawns and the debris of St Valentine's Day starts to fade in the nation's flower-vases and chocolate-boxes, some of us are waking up and wondering where we are, that almost-forgotten sensation of the wild-oats years. We have been in bed with the box. Channel 4, which has a feeling for grouping progs together into \\u2018themes\\u2019, identified St Valentine's Day (sorry, weekend) as a possible banker. Among the terrestrial channels, Channel 4 has in any case taken on the mantle of the senator for adult-intelligent viewing: in other words, the place where you can watch randily beneath a  thinnish veneer of knowledge and a deeper understanding of self. In pursuit of this, the channel released a veritable blizzard of love and sex, 18 hours and 25 minutes of viewing, of which the most bizarre 20 minutes was surely The Naked Chat Show. Was this going to be the ultimate in body language, or a pointless gimmick? A bit of both, but quite revealing. The issue was: we are ashamed of our bodies, but why? Before a generally topless audience and a modestly genitalia-flaunting panel, the matter was explored with a seriousness so profound that it became unconsciously hilarious. It was amusing to see one middle-aged panellist's efforts to keep a piece of paper judiciously positioned on his lap, while another revealed that flaps of loose skin other than the ear-lobes and the nostrils can be pierced with decorative pins. Page three models and married rubber fetishists, with a slave on the side, flickered before our very astonished eyes. Sensibly the presenter, matinee idol-manque Richard Jobson, kept his dinner suit on. Is television, like sex, 95 per cent anticipation and 5 per cent realisation? I suppose it depends who you're having television with. It seems that BBC2 responded to Channel 4's Love Weekend by scheduling A Night of Love, totalling seven hours 20 minutes of programmes. If we have to make a comparison between the individual approaches, I think that channel two felt we had to be punished for our sins while Channel 4 took the more sanguine view that for so long as love and sex exist, television might as well look on, an electronic voyeuristic intermediary. But there were exceptions. Channel 4 started its enormous love-bite on Saturday with the truly horrendous 1987 American box-office film Dirty Dancing, one of those excruciating grapples with the twin obsessions of yoof culture and family values \\u2014 yet which, with predictable weasel-writing, had a thoroughly deflating happy ending of school prom dimensions. BBC2, on the other hand, unleashed the magnificent if not majestic if not ultra-enormous comedienne Jo Brand to launch their seduction. Sprawled on a long-suffering double-bed like a beached whale, she dissected with witty, worldly sarcasm a series of clips from films and television which showed love being suspected, pursued, required and abandoned by performers as disparate as Frank Finlay and Sid James. The title of Tie Me Up and Bind Me Robin was derived from a quote from Maid Marion in the wholly innocent 1955 series Robin Hood. It was a brilliant touch that stole a chunk of Channel 4 thunder. There has been little escape from St Valentinism on television, with even two of the dreaded soap operas niftily timing weddings for around now. Brookside is going for a double-whammy \\u2014 sorry, two weddings; Eldorado on the other hand is heading for one. But on Friday night, guess what? Not a single one of these love matches was going smoothly. It's surely an indication that St Valentine has borrowed St Nicholas's pocket calculator, and is determined to turn his eternal dream into a business. Television is terminally lovesick. The old Egyptian remedy, apparently was to drink beer from an old shoe, which is why I'm sitting here untying my laces. Old angle on modern ills The knowledge and experience of witch doctors is helping scientists, says DAVID SIMPSON, in the search for new drugs THE recent successful launch of an American company, Shaman Pharmaceutical, on the New York and London Stock Exchanges highlights the renewed interest in finding cures for modern diseases by using centuries-old remedies often based on the natural properties of rare plants. The issue was oversubscribed and we will see other companies in this field coming to the market this year. A shaman is a much respected and highly-skilled member of the so-called primitive Indian tribes still to be found living in remote areas of the Amazonian rain forests. Most often known to us as witch doctors or medicine men, it has now been realised that their accumulated knowledge and experience of which natural substances work in the rapid healing of wounds, or alleviation of pain, is a major resource which modern science can use to good effect in producing \\u2018new\\u2019 drugs. My daughter, Dr Ann Mitchell, who got her PhD at Heriot-Watt University in microbiology, spends much of her time in the Caquita Medio region of the Columbian Amazon, living and working with the Uitoto y Muinane Indians observing their healing techniques and categorising and collecting plant specimens. She is one of many young researchers involved with the Expedicion Humana 1992 programme run by the Javeriana University in Bogota, which, in turn, is part of a worldwide project supported by the Royal Geographic Society to track down and codify the enormous body of information still existing in traditional native cultures worldwide. There is great urgency to complete the work because of the well-publicised rapid and irreversible erosion of ancient cultures and environments. Already many of the herbs and plants used by the world's first effective medical organisations \\u2014 that of the Hippocratic Greeks \\u2014 are lost to use forever. An organisation called the Foundation for Ethnic Biology (FEB) was officially launched at Oxford University earlier this month specifically to provide a central clearing house for information on how natural substances and ancient cultures can help modern medicine. The FEB will try to build up a \\u00a310 million fund to create companies that can develop and licence pharmaceutical products. The problems of sifting out the valuable and proven ingredients of native medicines are formidable. The practitioners frequently have no form of writing and their multitude of languages present great problems for translators. The people are generally friendly but shy and it takes a long time to gain their confidence to the point where they will teach a visiting scientist the secrets of their art. For people like my daughter there is also the ethical dilemma to be faced on the funding needed to support the research work. Finding a potential wonder drug in the root of some Amazonian plant might easily excite the giant pharmaceutical industry players but there is then the risk that over exploitation would change the way of life of the natives and potentially destroy the very environment one is trying to preserve. For example quinine, extracted from the bark of the cinchona tree, was used by the South American Indians to reduce malarial fever long before the Spanish invaded in 1500. Cinchona used to grow in profusion on the eastern slopes of the Andes but over-cropping caused the trees to die out by the mid 1800s. Synthetic drugs such as quinacrine and chloroquine, were developed to replace natural quinine but some strains of malaria are found to be resistant and doctors are using quinine again to treat malaria in Vietnam, fortunately, trees grow well in Java which is now the main global source. Obviously not all shaman practices are applicable in the modern world, one procedure involved blowing tobacco smoke over a sick person because it was believed to have magical healing powers \\u2014 I can't see that selling too well today! Scotland has a well established relationship with the pioneering work in the Colombian Amazon and Dr Sandy Gray, of Strathclyde University, makes frequent visits there. The Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh also has had a long involvement with the cultivation and development of plants with medicinal properties and we have our own Scottish traditions of herbal cures for a long list of ailments. Given that there does not seem to be the same reluctance to imbibe proteins made from plants as there is to be using the proteins in the milk of Dr Ron James' transgenic sheep or Scotgen's \\u2018humanised\\u2019 mouse antibodies, there may be a good case for a local entrepreneur to transfer an Amazonian shaman's technology to make a Scottish national wonder drug. Financing such an enterprise should be possible since James's Pharmaceutical Proteins and Scotgen both raised several million dollars of venture capital \\u2014 admittedly from American and French sources. Home-grown: Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden also has had a long involvement with the development of plants with medicinal properties No business with words of lurve VALENTINE'S Day reached a new low in bad taste this year when the Diary received a truly awful business Valentine card with a twelve-line poem that was excruciatingly awful. Even if the consultants William Mercer Fraser are as good at business as they claim to be and the answer to everyone's communications problems, the style is a guaranteed turn-off. Use of donors' blood supplies in private hospitals Recently, in these columns I repeated the claim that commercial hospitals are being subsidised by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, a division of the NHS. Professor Ronald H Girdwood, the chairman of the Scottish Blood Transfusion Association, took me to task in a letter at the end of last month. He is a renowned and honourable man, but with regard to this matter he is either being naive or obtuse. Here are the facts: For the first 40 years of its existence, the blood transfusion authority in Scotland provided the private sector with blood on request and without making any charge whatsoever. It had no idea if the private hospitals were in turn charging their patients. This subsidising of profit-making medical establishments was not mentioned in SNBTS annual reports. Parliament was not aware of the practice; voluntary donors were never informed. Then in the early 1980s, as a result of a campaign by local health councils and trade unions, the Government introduced a minimal (less than \\u00a320 per unit) handling charge. At the time Professor Girdwood's association (the prime aim of this charitable, voluntary body is to \\u2018promote the interests of donors and pass their worries to Government\\u2019) refused to take any part in this move for overdue reform. In the last decade, the handling charge has been raised slightly. The contention of many is that the charge should be at three or four times the present level. This would end the gifting by the NHS to the private sector in Scotland of not less than \\u00a3200,000 each year (over \\u00a32 million south of the Border). Meanwhile, it would be fairer and franker of the SNBTS to mention in its information leaflets and at its collection centres that a donor's blood might end up in the private sector. At the same time a check should be made to ensure that the private sector passes on only the handling charge to its patients. Lastly, it should not be beyond the capacity of the SNBTS (undoubtedly the most efficient in Britain and, therefore, quite possibly the world) to devise a system whereby those who wish their blood to stay with the NHS can be satisfied. Filling the vacuum CRIME is no longer something that happens to other people. The chilling pictures of tiny James Bulger being led away to a brutal death have touched millions, not just because of the tragedy that befell a little boy but because they have made people realise how much their own lives have become defiled by fear of crime. Parents deny their children the outdoor play that they themselves enjoyed. Householders return home apprehensive of having been burgled. People stay in at night to avoid the shadows of the city streets. Car-owners disable their vehicles every time they park. A mother takes her eye off her toddler in a shopping mall and he is murdered. We are all victims. We all want something done. But the trouble is that people, unable to understand why it is happening, tend to look backwards, not around them, for answers. They presume that changing values are declining values and seek some malign influence to blame. Take yesterday's comments by two former Home Secretaries, Kenneth Baker and Lord Merlyn-Rees, about the Bulger case. Many would endorse Mr Baker's diagnosis of the \\u2018moral vacuum\\u2019 surrounding some young people. But what is his prescription? New forms of detention, fewer trendy clerics and, familiarly, less violent television. Lord Merlyn-Rees, too, believes that violence on television incites violence in the young. Both stop short of demanding censorship, though Mary Whitehouse is characteristically less tentative. The problem with this sort of approach is that it can make standards yet more remote from those most in need of them. Dissuade churches from social comment, and all that is left is abstract philosophy. Take all violence out of television drama and you disconnect it from reality, leaving it unable to portray anything deeper than its own bonds. Some performance art does contain gratuitous violence. But it is not generally the stuff that appears on television, where self-restraint has become the norm. It is the stuff in the video shop, to which people have consciously turned in preference to what is broadcast. That, sadly, is a market at work, and suppressing it would only bestow the seedy glamour of the underground. Even if, as is open to question, screen violence really does invite emulation, that is the wrong approach. The challenge is to attract the alienated young back into the heart of society, not reduce its appeal for them still further. There can never be an excuse for what happened to James Bulger, but we should all hope that some day there will be a better understanding of why it happened. Recession cure Most economists, industrialists and politicians seem to agree that the cure of recession and unemployment must depend on reducing interest rates to boost economic growth, personal consumption and industrial investment. That recipe may have been appropriate in the past when personal consumption was largely met from the output of labour-intensive British industries. But nowadays much of any increased consumption will be met by extra imports from countries with more efficient industries or cheaper labour, and by extra output from British industries generated by greater automation and productivity per employee rather than by increased employment. And extra investment in industry will be directed to still further improving that productivity and minimising the need for manpower. The main penalty of recession is unemployment, and what we need is more jobs, not more consumption. We already have too much consumption, particularly of things damaging to health and the environment: of sugar, confectionery, fatty foods, alcohol, tobacco, motoring, noisy entertainment, pornography, prostitution, and the toys and knick-knacks produced by polluting industries. Rather than a boost to consumption, we need some redistribution of wealth from the employed to the creation of jobs for the unemployed. We should increase taxes on inessential, unhealthy and damaging forms of consumption and use the proceeds to fund socially beneficial forms of employment. There should be a heavy excise duty on sugar, higher taxation of motor fuel, and an extension of VAT to all but the necessities for healthy life, principally unsweetened cereal products and raw fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs and pasteurised milk. The proceeds should fund the creation of extra jobs in the construction of crime, fire and rot-resistant housing, the improvement of public transport, a strengthening of the law enforcement agencies, supervision of school areas against bullying, removal of litter and graffiti from public places, and labouring in schemes of environmental improvement. Present policies seem likely to yield too few extra jobs for the price that will ultimately have to be paid in renewed inflation or higher taxation of earnings and savings. Treaty protocol In a diary item (12 February), Fordyce Maxwell accuses me \\u2018of having trouble with the facts\\u2019. Even a cursory examination of amendment 27 to the Maastricht Bill will show that it is not me but Mr Maxwell who is having trouble. For the record, I stated on Radio Scotland, \\u2018that amendment 27 if carried would not be a vote for the Social Chapter.\\u2019 I went on to say \\u2018it would be the exact opposite.\\u2019 Amendment 27 seeks to delete the protocol on social policy from the Maastricht Treaty. The social protocol, if implemented, would simply give the UK's permission to the other 11 community states to use community institutions and funds to meet the cost of administering their separate social agreement. Consequently, to delete the protocol would prevent this happening. So a vote for amendment 27 will be a vote to prevent the social chapter being administered. Which is why, I will have no difficulty in supporting amendment 27. The message in Clinton's rhetoric WHEN President Clinton unveils his plans for the US economy in full today, Americans will already have a fairly clear idea of what faces them. On Monday evening he gave fair warning of an increase in taxes, and spending cuts to reduce the expanding federal budget deficit. Both were necessary, he said, in order to build the foundation for an improvement in the standard of living. Short-term pain for long-term gain \\u2014 or in his words, \\u2018this is nothing less than a call to arms, to restore the vitality of the American dream\\u2019. It is a bold move, since it throws into reverse one of Clinton's central election pledges. During his campaign, he promised not to raise taxes for the middle classes; he is now faced with the realisation that if he is to cut the deficit and fulfil his promises to improve social welfare, education and training and to overhaul health provisions, then tax increases which extend beyond the seriously wealthy are unavoidable. By appealing directly to his fellow-citizens and banking on a generous response, the President may just have gambled correctly. It was certainly a more honest confession than George Bush ever managed, and by saying that he has been forced into this decision by an expanding deficit which has gone \\u2018beyond even the worst official government estimates from last year\\u2019, he is also confronting Americans with some central truths about their economic situation. By rights, Wall Street should have responded well. Here, after all, was a President prepared to take the economy seriously and to begin the long process of hauling it back into some semblance of order. Instead, the dealers took the short-term view, judged that Clinton's credibility would suffer, and began selling. Whether the steep falls of yesterday turn into something more serious remains to be seen. But as the speculators wait for the President's more substantive statement, they might reflect that the average middle class voter will probably see things rather differently. This, after all, is a programme designed to cut the US budget deficit and boost the economy. It is moving in the right direction. There are those who argue that the signs of a recovery obviate any additional action by the administration to boost the economy. Indeed, that hands-off approach underlay the whole \\u2018trickle down\\u2019 philosophy of the Reagan and Bush years. But given the current high levels of unemployment Clinton must be right to take positive action. As well as the pain of tax increases, the president is also proposing a stimulus of $16 billion in spending on public works projects and $15 billion in tax breaks for businesses as an immediate step to get the economy moving and combat unemployment. This will be followed by longer term steps. These are sensible measures, and Clinton deserves better from the Wall Street panic-merchants. He is likely to find a more solid and reliable reaction from the public opinion polls later this week. They will tell him what middle America thinks of a President who is prepared to face reality. Right's desperate search for a new Renaissance THE National Front published its \\u2018300 measures for a Renaissance of France\\u2019 on Monday. A year ago it would have made headline news. Today, with just over a month to go before the general election, it only merited a few lines on the inside pages. For the past decade the almost continuous and often spectacular rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme-right party has been the great talking point of French politics. Now it appears to have gone off the boil. Its propositions are no less outrageous; its leaders' language no less extreme. But the novelty has begun to wear thin, and the nation is turning its attention to other matters. Even the normally ebullient Mr Le Pen has had to lower his sights. Before the regional elections a year ago he was constantly predicting that his party would win 15-20 per cent of the vote. Now, in the run up to the general election, he is talking more modestly of its showing a \\u2018progression in votes.\\u2019 In fact, it will be lucky to do even that. The latest opinion polls are predicting that the National Front will get between 10 and 12 per cent of the vote \\u2014 down both from the 14 per cent it won in last year's regional elections and from Mr Le Pen's own record score of 14.4 per cent in the 1988 presidential elections. The immigration issue, the National Front's favourite political battering ram, is still there. Some 100,000 immigrants continue to pour perfectly legally into the country every year. Nine million (16 per cent) of France's 57 million inhabitants are now first or second generation \\u2018immigrants.\\u2019 But the continuing slowdown in the economy, coupled with a rise in unemployment to an all-time record of just on 3 million (10.5 per cent of the workforce), has pushed these concerns into second place. And the French public no longer accepts the National Front's simplistic equation of immigration with unemployment. In a poll, published last week, asking voters to rank in order of priority the issues they most wanted discussed during the election campaign, unemployment came top by a long way, followed by worries about the funding of the badly-indebted State pension and social security fund, and then education and training. Immigration was mentioned only in fourth place, followed by urban crime, and then the environment. The National Front has been suffering from two other developments on the French political scene. On the one hand, the two mainstream right-wing parties, the neo-Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UBF, have succeeded in stealing some of its thunder by themselves espousing more extremist positions on immigration and by adopting a more overtly nationalist and populist tone on other issues like Maastricht. At the same time, the rise of the Greens has robbed the National Front of its role as the main anti-establishment, protest party. Twenty three of the \\u2018300 measures\\u2019 in the National Front's new programme are devoted to environmental matters. But the Greens are still a good 5-8 points ahead of the Front in the opinion polls. Just over a year ago everyone got a bit of a scare when an opinion poll showed that one third of the French agreed with the extremist ideas supported by Mr Le Pen \\u2014 priority for the French (as opposed to immigrants) in jobs, housing, and family benefits; the abolition of all income tax and its replacement with higher rates of VAT; the reintroduction of the death penalty for murderers and drug traffickers; and the expulsion of the immigrant long-term unemployed; the banning of tourist visas for Arabs and Africans (to stop illegal immigration), and so on. But most publicity was given to the finding in the same poll that two-thirds of the French regarded Mr Le Pen as a positive \\u2018danger for democracy\\u2019, while three quarters believed his party was \\u2018incapable of governing France.\\u2019 The latest polls showed that 82 per cent have a poor opinion of the National Front \\u2014 the highest rejection rate for any party. Nevertheless, Mr Le Pen should not be under-estimated. He remains a formidable political operator and is usually at his best on the hustings. Although support for his party seems to be stagnating and may even be on the decline, it still has an important following, mainly among the poorer working and artisan classes and the retired. The election campaign has only just got under way, and Mr Le Pen may yet reclaim the limelight. But there is not much he can really hope for in the present elections. Under the system of proportional representation used in the 1986 election, his party managed to win 35 parliamentary seats with just under 10 per cent of the vote. But with the return of the two-round majority voting system, it is unlikely to win more than one or two seats this time, even if it succeeds in equalling its previous best score of 14 per cent. In the past the National Front has sometimes managed to enter into local pacts with the two mainstream right-wing parties. But now, buoyed by the prospect of a landslide victory in March, they no longer want to have anything to do with the disreputable Mr Le Pen. In future, the danger of extreme-right policies is more likely to come from within the victorious mainstream conservative ranks than from outside. When judges lean too far towards leniency Prof Ross Harper supports legislation to give the Crown the right of appeal against sentence in Scotland SENTENCING is one of the most important functions of a judge. The word judge, for the purpose of this article, includes sheriffs and magistrates. They pass judgment on an accused taking into account the gravity of the crime and the circumstances of the accused. Sentences vary from an absolute discharge to life imprisonment, and include deferred sentence, admonition, probation, fines and community service. In Scotland, we do not have the English system of suspended sentences. In England, the Crown may apply to review a sentence \\u2014 as they are contemplating in the recent case of rape where the accused was told to give \\u00a35OO to the victim \\u2018for a holiday\\u2019. At present in Scotland there is no right of the Crown to appeal against too lenient a sentence. There is, however, a bill currently going through Parliament which will change that situation. Most often our judges are totally right. Unhappily, in some cases they are hopelessly wrong. Sometimes, judges have bad days. We all do. Sometimes, a judge will be particularly impressed by a mellifluous and seductive plea put up on behalf of an accused and will sentence leniently to the point of mistake. Sometimes, a judge may suffer from irrational horror at a particular case and sentence too severely \\u2014 to the point of mistake. Mistakes can be made, and if we do not allow correction we are fooling ourselves. If a judge has slept badly, has had an indigestible breakfast, tripped over the cat, has been roundly abused by his wife and scolded by his children, or if his mind has been distracted by the children's school reports, a narrow defeat at a curling match or whatever, he may be temporarily off form. Where probation is appropriate a prison sentence may mistakenly be imposed or vice versa. If the judge makes a mistake by imposing too severe a sentence, then the accused can, and often does, appeal to a higher court. If the High Court agrees that the sentence is too severe, then that sentence may be amended. This is proper, this is just and, as importantly, it is the law. But if a judge errs the other way and fines a rapist a few hundred pounds, or puts on probation a bank robber with previous convictions who clearly ought to go directly to jail, nothing happens. Simply because the Crown does not have a right of appeal against sentence. That is what the Government is changing. In my view, rightly so. Many argue that such an appeal by the Crown against too lenient a sentence is simply not cricket. If an accused person hears that he is going to be sentenced to one year in jail, it is argued that it would be distinctly unfair for a prosecutor to appeal. Personally, I am not in favour of mammoth jail sentences except for the deserving few \\u2014 and that's not so much a matter of punishment as a means of keeping society free from their future depredations. But society has an interest in the determination of the case. I readily acknowledge that in Scotland the Crown has no direct interest in sentence in as much as it doesn't, in contrast with Russia or America, request the court to impose a specific sentence. The prosecutor presents the facts fairly and cogently to the judge who, after hearing the defence submissions, reaches a conclusion as to sentence. Whether the Crown should have an interest in sentence or not is, of course, another matter. I am personally seduced by the prospect of the Crown and the defence being able to agree a sentence prior to a plea, especially in the case of large complex fraud trials. But that's another major debate. But why on earth should the Crown not be allowed to appeal? If we accept that mistakes in sentencing can be made and accept that sentencing is a matter of considerable interest, importance and relevance to society, and accept that the prosecution represents society, then it is simply monstrous that an appeal does not lie at its hands. In many criminal cases there are victims \\u2014 casualties of assault, rape, theft or fraud. Sentencing process encapsulates the interest of all. The victim does not have a special place in the criminal court. The victim is not represented, nor indeed necessarily consulted. The victim has no right of representation. Since sentencing is a matter of societal process and since we engage in an adversarial system, a right of appeal which is given to one side should not be denied to the other. By doing so, I readily acknowledge that we are changing, ever so slightly, the role of the Crown with regard to sentencing. I personally welcome that change. Sentencing is too important to be left in the hands of one person without recourse to a higher authority. While supporting change to allow the Crown the right of appeal against too lenient sentences, I would advocate another change. I abhor sentences being increased sneakily. And this can happen. When I was very young, and indeed Malcolm Rifkind, who was even younger, was my counsel, we represented two individuals who were charged with a serious assault. They were both old lags and were sentenced each to ten years imprisonment. We thought this was an exceptionally high sentence and both of them appealed. One of the accused withdrew his appeal, the other proceeded with it. His sentence was increased to one of 12 years! This, in my view, is totally wrong and contrary to my notions of natural justice. By all means let either side appeal, but you cannot, in all conscience, increase the sentence of some poor beggar who avers, often acting with appropriate legal advice, that the sentence is already too high. Fair's fair. Taking note of sex and the single student As university teachers suggest a code of conduct, Dea Birkett recalls a personal encounter with a lecherous lecturer AS EVERY student knows, affairs with lecturers are as much a part of university life as examination nerves, drunken parties and late night deliberations on the Romantic poets. But as long as these extra-curricular affairs are conducted discreetly behind closed departmental doors, the academic establishment turns a blind eye. At last the Association of University Teachers (AUT) has brought the subject of staff-student sexual relations out into the open. In a draft policy statement entitled: \\u2018University Consensual Relationships\\u2019 published last week, the AUT recommends lecturers officially report romantic or sexual involvement and cease professional responsibility for the student concerned. The AUT statement is designed to protect students from sexual harassment and lecturers from charges of favouritism. As the statement makes clear: \\u2018Students who are involved in sexual/romantic relationships with staff and who do not consider their involvement to be truly consensual should have the right of complaint under a sexual harassment policy.\\u2019 But in the hierarchical world of academia, drawing a line between consensual and non-consensual sex is far from easy. As the AUT statement recognises: \\u2018to embark upon a sexual/romantic relationship with a student involves serious difficulties rooted in the unequal power, and hence choice, of the parties concerned.\\u2019 My own experiences echo these difficulties. When I was a 22-year-old Edinburgh University student, a tutor made unwelcome sexual advances to me in his office. From my perspective, it was a clear cut case of abuse. But at the same time as my accusation was being assessed by a prestigious board of Edinburgh academics, just a departmental door away a female student and her male lecturer were engaging in clandestine consensual sex. There was nothing forced or unwanted in their relationship; they fancied each other, mentally and physically, and as two reasonable adults indulged their desires. She felt no grounds for grievance, and many years later still has no regrets. Now a lecturer herself, her former lover is a good and supportive friend. Not all academic alliances are as equal. I remember one dashing lecturer who regularly took his pick from each year's fresher intake. All of his young women would have regarded their conduct as consensual. The lecturer may have been 20 years older, wealthier, and inevitably wiser, but that is often why the student chose to sleep with him. Power, even academic power, is very sexy. The AUT's draft policy statement points to this imbalance. But is it the role of trade unions to monitor how equal personal relationships are? Should an office worker's union draw up guidelines requiring bosses to declare  publicly if they see their secretaries after hours? Perhaps the relationship between academic staff and student is essentially different so that regulation is required. It is only the medical profession that legislates for sex between doctors and patients. The General Medical Council advises that if a medical practitioner engages in a sexual relationship with his patient this may be considered an abuse of privilege and lead to charges of serious professional misconduct. The AUT's discussion paper points to many qualities \\u2014 trust, confidence and dependency \\u2014 shared by academics and doctors. In addition, it argues that in the academic arena, a single affair can affect more than two people: \\u2018Fellow students and colleagues and the learning and working environment will be affected, especially when conflict of interest and unfairness are involved.\\u2019 In the United States, some colleges implement policies which bar staff from engaging in any sexual conduct with a student, however consensual. The AUT has rejected recommending such strict policing of personal relationship. A motion supporting a code of conduct \\u2018preventing consensual relationships as constituting an abuse of power\\u2019 was dropped in favour of a more softly-softly approach. The member of staff must report, but need not terminate, the relationship. The AUT's code is an implicit recognition of the right of university students to bed down with the partner of their choice. Women should not simply be seen as smitten fools in need of protection; when they accept the advances of those professionally above them, they know the murky pond in which they plunge. Yet still many choose for reasons \\u2014 good or bad but their own \\u2014 to sleep with their academic teachers. We cannot separate power from sex. But we can distinguish between wanted and unwanted sexual attention, especially important in universities where futures are forged. Staff-student sexual relationships are not role models, but nor are they necessarily deplorable; sexual harassment of a student is. My own case dragged on for months, swamped with innuendos \\u2014 if another student was having a clandestine consensual affair, why couldn't I have been too? Eventually my case was supported and the tutor asked to resign. By opening those departmental doors, the AUT guidelines provide a powerful weapon against the hidden crime of sexual harassment in the ivory towers. Getting smart on skiving Paola Buonadonna and Douglas Fraser look at the measures being taken to combat truancy in schools and colleges \\u2018We have actually saved money because the system saves the work of a teacher and a half. We are able to identify absentees and use the extra time to tackle the problem\\u2019 SCHOOL pupils skipping classes to play with the latest piece of Sonic the Hedgehog software could find another computer is at work to track them down. Their absence may be noted by devices like \\u2018optical mark readers\\u2019 and \\u2018swipe cards\\u2019which log them in and out of each lesson. Students, too, are already finding further education colleges are tracking them electronically, with interest likely to grow as universities become aware of poor attendance at lectures. The use of information technology to keep tabs on truants is receiving particular encouragement south of the Border, where the Department for Education is putting \\u00a38.6 million into stepping up the fight against truancy, while Scottish Office research has put emphasis on identifying the varied causes. Three main programmes have been tried and tested so far in schools and colleges on both sides of the Border. Smart cards are perhaps the best known of the devices in the fight against school-dodging and they also contribute to security and safety. The electronic identity cards are swiped through readers stationed in every classroom at the beginning of each lesson. The system, developed by the Dundee-based company Offcome Data, costs around \\u00a310,000 to install, including the computers, the readers and the cards. Its advantages include the virtual elimination of the time-consuming registering routine and its versatility. It can be used to gain access to libraries or computer rooms in the buildings. And in the event of fire, it offers immediate and reliable information on the number and location of people to be evacuated. Satisfied customers include Perth College of Further Education which installed the system five years ago. Jack Gardner, director of the management and information system unit at the college, says: \\u2018We needed a faster and more accurate registration method and this works exceptionally well. Our main concern was not truancy, but our students still need to show high attendance to guarantee their fees. \\u2018The system invested them with this responsibility and there is no room for errors or excuses. We paid for it ourselves, but covered expenses by cutting soul-destroying administrative jobs which only involved keying in names.\\u2019 The system has its drawbacks as a response to school truancy. It would be quite easy for a pupil to swipe in several cards allowing his friends to truant. But its time-saving qualities \\u2014 up to 30 minutes each day for each teacher \\u2014 attracted the St George's School for Boys in Southampton, which has been piloting the system for two years. DEPUTY head teacher Brian Musk says: \\u2018We have actually saved money because the system saves the work of a teacher and a half. We are able to identify absentees immediately and use the extra time to tackle the problem with academic counselling. Our pupils are conscious of being awarded responsibility and there has been no abuse of the cards at all.\\u2019 The Optical Mark Reader, produced by Johnson and Pinnock, at \\u00a35,000 to \\u00a36,000, is a cheaper and more effective way of keeping track of students. Its drawback is the time involved, as it requires teachers to take register at each lesson by marking pink sheets that are then read into an optical mark reader. Francis Howlett, of England's National Council for Educational Technology, explains: \\u2018The system can give teachers comprehensive information on attendance at the push of a button. That could include not only how often each pupil is absent, but also which lessons are being missed, which teachers are being avoided, and even which ones tend to be absent when the local football team plays at home.\\u2019 Robin Chambers, the principal of Stoke-Newington school in South London, where the programme has been used for two months, says: \\u2018We are ironing out a few difficulties, for instance getting the individual answer sheet completed in the correct way and working out who has the time to do it. \\u2018But the machine saves a great deal of time in that it automatically produces statistics and its print-outs clearly show patterns in the absences. We are able to spot problems earlier on and take action.\\u2019 The most recent development in anti-truancy technology is the Electronic Attendance Registration System (EARS), produced by Bronton Computers at prices varying between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a315,000. Teachers retain control of registration \\u2014 keeping the important element of one-to-one contact \\u2014 and perform it in the usual time, but instead of noting absences on paper, they feed the information directly onto a portable electronic register which then passes it to the central computer. The system will be piloted starting from next week by North Westminster Community school, in London, with funds provided by the local authority. According to Guy Corbet, from Broncom: \\u2018EARS allows excellent cross-reference of attendance throughout the school at any time at a fingertip. Students are not given chances to cheat, disappearing after the first registration and retain personal contact with their teachers every day.\\u2019 Of course the system is expensive and while it saves paperwork it does not appear to reduce registration times as such. Meanwhile many secondary schools north of the Border are opting for a cheaper option, the Scottish Computerised School Administration Programme, or SCAMP. This is a set of databases which collect all the pupils' details, from absences to courses taken and exam presentations. SCAMP speeds the process of filling the absences for the day and by 10am, the school has a complete map of absentees whom they can then begin to check on. Its main drawback is that it does not discriminate between authorised and unauthorised absences. But how do children react to this new electronic scrutiny? \\u2018There's scope for any system to be alienating and oppressive,\\u2019 says Eric Blyth, director of the Centre for Educational Welfare Studies at Huddersfield University. \\u2018But we're talking about a generation much more computer-literate than the last and today's children are very unlikely to react badly.\\u2019 He does point out, however, that the technology simply measures attendance \\u2014 it does not improve it. The answer to that may lie closer to home with parents. Eric Blyth says the best option is to use the technology along with efforts to make children want to be in school. White Hart Lane School in London used this approach when attendance had slumped to just 72 per cent. Paul White, the project manager, says: \\u2018We have rooms set aside with comfy chairs, music and  televisions where pupils can go during break or before school. We've also introduced rewards for good attendance like pens and key rings, which are very popular \\u2014 they've even got \\u2018street credibility\\u2019 status.\\u2019 Since the pupil-friendly approach to truancy was introduced, attendance has improved by 15 per cent. There has also been an unexpected spin-off \\u2014 teacher attendance at the school has improved by 5.1 per cent. The anatomy of a classroom truant WHATEVER our image of a truant may be \\u2014 layabout, glue-sniffer, petty criminal \\u2014 a recent report from the Scottish Office urges us to dispel a few misunderstandings about truancy. The term covers a vast range of reasons for not attending school, including phobias, parental pressure and the absence of realistic incentives for fourth-year leavers. Although poverty and family problems enhance the risk of truancy, this is not the major factor. A child's personality, be they shy, violent, arrogant or insecure, can also lead to skipping school. Low motivation to attend school has very diverse causes: truants may be bored with unchallenging courses or scared by too demanding ones. In extreme cases they develop a real school phobia, for reasons ranging from bullying by classmates to schoolwork anxiety. Parental attitudes are fundamental in determining the response to truancy. Some parents may be encouraging their children to help at home or even take up work instead of going to school. For these reasons it is suggested that in tackling the problem, good monitoring arrangements should be coupled with an early involvement of school and parents. The report says home phone calls can be useful but only in high phone-ownership areas, and they may be regarded as intrusive. Home visiting is an expensive but helpful alternative for persistent truants. It urges links between guidance teachers and other agencies, such as social work, education welfare officers and children's panels, and to work on a flexible approach to the curriculum, enabling fourth year leavers to follow particular classes while performing work experience and voluntary work in the community. Most importantly, it has been shown that a positive school ethos and high staff morale will increase pupils' involvement in school activities and combat a lack of motivation. Message of strength from life's struggle Easterhouse for enterprise and vigour? Peter Jones hears positive words for a Labour policy forum \\u2018I HOPE that the commission will not gain from Easterhouse the usual negative view,\\u2019 said Bob Holman, a community worker. \\u2018When photographers come here, they always want to take photographs of the worst flats.\\u2019 The members of the Commission on Social Justice, who had flown from south-east England in airline comfort yesterday morning and now were seated on hard chairs in the decrepit surroundings of the Salvation Army hall, nodded amiably. Their mission: to find a policy for tackling poverty as radical as the welfare system founded by Beveridge 50 years ago. It is as awesome a task as the work in Easterhouse by the Salvation Army captain Eric Buchanan is daunting. The hall is surrounded by 30,000 people and for most of them the state housing and welfare system is a failure. This was the commission's first visit to meet people at the sharp end of the system. It was set up last year at the behest of the Labour leader, John Smith, but has an independent life under Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of the Office of Fair Trading. Leading the commission group, Patricia Hewitt, a former aide to Neil Kinnock, explains they are not just looking at social security, but at barriers to economic opportunity and how to help local people and local groups to overcome those barriers. Bob Holman, who works for a voluntary group, FARE (Family Action in Rogerfield and Easterhouse), pleads for the usual underclass stereotype to be ignored. \\u2018This is a strong area with strong people,\\u2019 he says. Listening to the personal stories of the half-dozen Easterhouse people gathered in the hall \\u2014 stories of drug addiction, crime, alcoholism, unemployment, poverty \\u2014 it is hard to ignore his appeal. But, listening to what they are actually doing, another story emerges \\u2014 one of determination, vigour, single-mindedness, struggle and enterprise. Carol tells of a life going downhill after she became pregnant at 14, of a descent into doctors' prescriptions (\\u2018Largactil, Valium, you name it\\u2026 I was terrible on drugs, shouting, swearing\\u2026\\u2018), of her daughter being taken into care and being kept there when she come out of hospital after getting off the doctors\\u2019 drugs. Now back with her daughter, with a husband and a sparkling bright wee boy, she says that the social workers still think of her as she was. As for the social security office, \\u2018You would think it was their money. They make you sit for hours. I've seen people sitting there for hours and hours, their weans soaking and starving.\\u2019 Carol, who has learned to manage her meagre budget as carefully as any accountant, exemplifies the deeper problem of Easterhouse behind the unemployment, said to be 30 per cent, but much higher when the unemployed 16- to 18-year-olds, those on invalidity benefit and people who do not register for non-existent work are taken into account. Once people like Carol have spent their money on rent, the poll tax and heating damp houses, Mr Holman explains, they have nothing left and hence there is no cash economy on which business and work can be based. But there is self-help. Sister Margaret introduces Ruby, who helps with a credit union. People join the savings club and after 12 weeks' contributing can get loans at 1 per cent interest. Another woman explains how a food co-operative has been set up, buying in bulk and selling at no profit to members. They were intended to compete with the vans that circulate the scheme. \\u2018We sell bread at 29p, it can cost maybe 50p from the vans.\\u2019 The vans have had to reduce their prices, she says, but there is some hostility. The credit unions, the food co-ops and an incipient knitting business which Sister Margaret is working on, could do more, but there is the problem of suitable premises, or lack of them. But they would not cure the endemic unemployment problem. James, 19, working in the hall under a community service order, has had a few months' work for the council since leaving school. Apart from two schoolmates whose fathers had a business, he cannot think of any with a job. \\u2018I get \\u00a367 a fortnight on the giro,\\u2019 he tells Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, who will have the eventual task of turning the commission's work into Labour policy. \\u2018I have to give \\u00a350 to my girlfriend who I live with. \\u2018When I was 17 I had nothing, I sold drugs to make money. See if I had a job? It would be brilliant. But there's 100 folk after every job. If it wasn't for Captain Eric here, I'd be getting into trouble.\\u2019 And if it wasn't for Captain Eric, Sister Margaret and a few others, there would be precious little of a toehold for people like James, Carol and many others in their struggle to build something of a life in Easterhouse. How to give such support is the crux of the problem, Ms Hewitt muses as she heads back south. STEPHEN MANSFIELD Jean Smart, a volunteer for the Easterhouse food co-operative, talks to Donald Dewar and Patricia Hewitt, of the Commission on Social Justice, yesterday Living rough: Stewart has been on the streets in Edinburgh for three years, sleeping wherever he can find shelter and surviving on a mixture of benefits and begging. He is among at least 35,000 Scots now without a home. Unable to find work after leaving the army, which he joined at 16, he has travelled as far as Holland in search of a job \\u2014 but to no avail. Returning to Scotland, he was forced to live on the street. A brief stay at a house provided by the district council ended after just two days when everything he had was stolen. Stewart, now 27, is scathing about attempts by officialdom to tackle homelessness and says ministers like Peter Lilley, the Social Security Secretary, need to experience the problems of the homeless directly. \\u2018Mr Lilley should go to any city in this country and try to live with nothing\\u2026find how degrading it is to go to those places and ask for blankets and ask for food.\\u2019 Chilling facts of death rise By Alison Daniels POVERTY and cuts in social security payments are linked to the high number of deaths in Britain each winter, campaigners will tell the Health Secretary, Virginia Bottomley, today. Delivering 40,000 ice cubes to the minister, representing the extra number of people who die each winter compared with the number of deaths during the summer, the Campaign for Cold Weather Credits hopes to draw attention to the plight of the poor and the elderly. In its report, the organisation denies the Government's claim that there is a significant decrease in the number of winter deaths. It says that evidence shows a sustained increase in deaths since the reform of social security and the withdrawal of heating additions in 1988. In Scotland, it estimates the death toll has risen by 7.5 per cent between 1988 and 1991. According to Damian Killeen, from the campaign, there are seven million households in Britain without adequate heating, with the unemployed, those on low incomes and elderly women, the most vulnerable. The report states that those who have lived on state pensions, income support or low pay, are most likely to live in the most energy-inefficient homes which are incapable of being heated to a minimum comfort standard. It adds that many cannot afford the fuel required to keep even one room warm. It also claims that the UK's winter death rate is twice that of cold countries such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark, and suggests that this discrepancy between the UK and other countries, puts in question the Government's focus on factors such as the effect of low temperatures on blood circulation. Mr Killeen said the organisation was calling on the Government to support proposals for regular weekly payments towards fuel costs for all households in receipt of means tested benefits. \\u2018People in the south-east of England would receive payment of \\u00a31 while those in the North of Scotland  would receive \\u00a36. We also want to see more money spent on the Government's home energy efficiency scheme, with all houses in poor physical condition upgraded to a minimum standard.\\u2019 He said the cost of the proposals would be offset by the resulting cut in National Health Service expenditure. \\u2018At present the NHS spends \\u00a31 billion treating people with illness related to cold, damp housing. We want to see resources redirected.\\u2019 Motoring under a dangerous illusion Jane Fowler appreciates her own failings as she takes to the open road with an advanced driving instructor WITH nearly 20 years of trouble-free driving behind me, I was relatively confident and assured when I switched on the ignition for my first lesson in advanced driving. I entertained the hope that while one or two lazy habits may have crept in, the passage of years will have added a certain maturity to my conduct behind the wheel. I never anticipated humiliation. But Jack McKellar, one of the most highly qualified advanced drivers attached to ROSPA, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, is not entertained by my driving. He is, in fact, appalled. \\u2018Foot off the clutch, hands at ten to two, mirror, offside mirror, signal, gear,\\u2019 he barks before I have gone ten yards. \\u2018Don't sit at a roundabout in first. Your shoes are wet, your foot might slip. Hand brake on, change to neutral, wait for the gap and then change gear. What do you see ahead?\\u2019 \\u2018A red car in front, then traffic lights. \\u2018Yes, and you should be able to see the bottom of the rear tyres of the car in front to be able to manoeuvre round it if need be. You won't be able to. You should also see a newsagent on your left, so anticipate a man crossing the road with his nose in a newspaper and children darting across with ice-creams or sweeties.\\u2019 Desperately, I scan the road for a newsagent. Where is it? Oh, there it is, miles ahead. \\u2018Exactly,\\u2019 says my companion, reading my mind, \\u2018and that's where you should be looking. Try to see five miles ahead on a country road and at least two to three hundred yards in a built-up area. Anticipation, observation and concentration should be your watchwords. \\u2018There's a garage on your right so look for exhaust fumes \\u2014 someone's about to move, they may pull out without looking. A school, so watch out for children, especially five minutes after the bell has rung. Wee Johnnie's late and he'll belt across that road no matter what. There are parked cars to your left so look out for moving feet \\u2014 children might dash out. Now tell me what signs we've just passed?\\u2019 I try to engage my brain as well as my gears. \\u2018Er, I don't know.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, you should. Signs exist to make driving safer, not to keep the regional council amused. You are approaching an access road to your left, a side road to your right \\u2014 what is the speed limit?\\u2019 Now I want a sign, I can't see one. \\u2018Forty miles an hour?\\u2019 \\u2018Thirty, so why are you doing forty-two? Ninety per cent of accidents are caused by people going too fast and there is never, never an excuse for speed. \\u2018I was late for work\\u2019\\u2014 too bad. I didn't stand a chance \\u2014 he ran right out in front of me.\\u2019 Wrong, you didn't anticipate that someone might run out. Now what does this sign mean? \\u2018A wiggly bend,\\u2019 I offer, triumphantly. \\u2018There is no such thing as a wiggly bend,\\u2019 comes the swift rebuke. \\u2018You mean a sharp double bend, first to the left, then to the right. So why aren't you in second gear?\\u2019 The exasperation is growing now. \\u2018And why do you insist on driving over every pothole? You missed one then \\u2014 why don't you go back and get it?\\u2019 Why not indeed? Why not drive straight home here and now and escape this humiliation for which I have, inexplicably, volunteered? Because I am aware that 95 per cent of road accidents are unnecessary and that, given the indices of probability, unless I improve my driving I too will join the crash victims. With three young children usually ensconced in the back of my car, this is a prospect I do not relish. But here I am without the distracting offspring and driving, or attempting to do so, with care and concentration. What is going wrong? \\u2018You're no worse than the rest,\\u2019 says my instructor, offering one small crumb of comfort. \\u2018But we live in a society where we are ruled by the clock. A few seconds delay at a junction and we regard it as minutes. We race constantly so it is not surprising that 90 per cent of accidents are caused by excess speed.\\u2019 Five hundred people are killed annually in Scotland alone and the Lothian branch of ROSPA are currently running \\u2018better driving\\u2019 courses every Wednesday evening. These are free and demand has been so great that what was initially planned as a single four-week course has been extended to sessions running until the spring. Drivers are offered talks illustrated with videos followed at the end of the course by an assessment of driving with an advanced instructor. Positioning, motorway and winter driving are some of the subjects covered but the night I attended the subject was speed. The videos, which did not include the guts and gore of crashes, were nevertheless disturbing. The lectures were delivered in an unpatronising way with useful information. Take the fact, for example, that a quiet residential road is one of the most dangerous since the driver has a perception of being in a wide, open space and feels he is driving slower than he actually is. One video shows two drivers on a private circuit. Both attempt to go as fast as possible. The good driver accelerates well, corners well and understands his car. The bad driver goes even faster but shows no acceleration sense and skids repeatedly. As in the best of parables, the good driver wins \\u2014 he who drives more carefully actually gets there faster. Perhaps a little contrived but Paul Richardson, a road safety officer taking the class, cites a more practical example. \\u2018Take the journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow, say from the Newbridge roundabout to the outskirts of Glasgow. Imagine you did the entire 45-mile journey at 70 mph, you would take 41 minutes. Drive it at 90 mph \\u2014 and you would take 36 minutes. What do you do with your extra five whole minutes, if you actually make it? Have a cup of tea to recover?\\u2019 IT is stressed that the braking distances learned for that driving test many years back are not idle theory. Most people naively imagine they will stop immediately when they jam on the brakes. Yet at only 30 miles an hour, the braking distance is 45 feet. Stopping distance \\u2014 that is, the time it takes for the brain to register the need to stop and the time it takes for the brake to take effect \\u2014 is at 70 miles an hour a frightening 315 feet. I revise my decision to abandon my first lesson and ask Jack McKellar if any drivers are particularly to blame \\u2014 business people, lorry drivers or journalists with three children? \\u2018Anyone who drives too fast,\\u2019 is his simple answer. \\u2018In America, they call advanced driving \\u2018defensive driving\\u2019\\u2014 and that's what it is. Learn to decelerate out of trouble rather than accelerate into it.\\u2019 As we continue our lesson, I manage to keep my speed down, keep my foot off the clutch except when changing gear, take heed of the signs \\u2014 well, most of them \\u2014 and watch for potential hazards both near and far. I feel I am making progress. \\u2018You're doing a million things wrong,\\u2019 is Jack's final summing up. \\u2018If I point out all your mistakes, I'll shatter your confidence.\\u2019 The key to good driving is care, concentration \\u2014 and watching the speed The ugly truth about being a glamour puss My thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers them WHAT IS happening today? Has someone turned the clock back 100 years and forgotten to tell me? Perhaps I have just become too comfortable with the cheering notion that women are far too busy getting on with their careers and their lives to crucify themselves worrying about ragged cuticles or the size of their ankles. Stupidly, I presumed that the ancient axiom that females were put on this planet for purely decorative purposes or that being pretty (or perhaps a spot of procreation) were the pinnacles of achievement had forever died out alongside the bustle and/or the bubble car. But no. We're still talking about Fiona Armstrong's calves and debating fulsomely about the length of hemlines. And how enervating, how disappointing, how absolutely\\u2026crushing to realise that nothing has changed \\u2014 over the last few decades at least\\u2014 and that for many women, their primary response is still to be beautiful rather than brainy. And why the hell not? The current status quo demands that others remain more interested in the size of one's bust rather than the size of one's IQ. And \\u2014 good grief \\u2014 the news that it is successful and powerful females saying this is enough to make strong women weep into their double gins. Or should that be double chins? This latest bulletin is so depressing, I put on 6lbs just thinking about it. And do you know something? I don't care. Really, Fay Weldon of all people should know better. In a volte-face that makes Germaine Greer's change of heart look like a tiny emotional trifle, the former feminists' champion has switched from the red corner to the blue corner without a blush in the process. The author of The Fat Woman's Joke and The Life and Loves of a She Devil has suddenly decided that being one of Britain's highest paid and smartest novelists who can command fees of \\u00a3200,000 per book simply isn't enough. \\u2018I used to think that you should always be yourself but now I like to be made up, smile and look like a woman should,\\u2019 preens Fay. she added: \\u2018Looking good on your book jackets means that more people will read you.\\u2019 Oh really? I can't recall Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Jeffrey Archer, Frederick Forsyth and Uncle Tom Cobley and all looking luscious on any of their best-selling titles. There is, of course, nothing wrong with trying to look your best, but for the born-again Weldon to refuse to see anyone unless she spent half the day in the hairdressers and then proclaim that she's only doing it to further her career (oh, please) smacks of hypocrisy of the very highest order. What she is really saying, after all this time, is that it is more important for a woman than a man to look good. Sadly, this makes all her high moral stances and her bonny sights of yesteryear come tumbling down like a house of cards. And weep, once more, for Steffi Graf who was hot off the baseline this week with a whingeing moan about her physique. Graf is one of the world's top tennis players whose supreme athleticism and guts have put her at the top of a very tough profession. Is this enough? Of course not. \\u2018I am no fan of my muscles,\\u2019 she bleated to a German magazine. \\u2018I hate my size.\\u2019 What on earth does she think has powered her to the top of her sport and put millions of deutschmarks into her bank account? Her winning smile or her pretty blonde hair? Not that you're interested, but my thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers them. If I had a physique as powerful and beautiful as Graf's, I'd use the strength to knock some sense into her daft head. Who does she want to look like? Vanessa Paradis or Michelle Pfeiffer? Sometimes despair is the only option. And what about Body Shop supremo Anita Roddick, the woman who has been feted for the last ten years as some kind of environmentally conscious feminist icon. I have always been deeply suspicious of Roddick and her cliche-ridden slogans and highly-publicised efforts to save the world, while quietly amassing a fortune on the side. I never bought that stuff about her ever-expanding conscience and I certainly never bought any of her beauty products. Life, for me, is certainly not too short to stuff a mushroom. However, it is at least ten million years too short to spend an evening piddling about with peppermint footbaths or rainforest elixir ear-lobe exfoliators. But wait! Anita the fabled feminist has a complaint she want you all to hear. She thinks it is simply awful that being successful and (reading the ill-camouflaged sub-text) gorgeous means that men won't chat her up, admire her breasts or perceive her as a sexual creature. Anita doesn't want to save the planet any more. She wants to save her self-esteem. She has decided that pretty compliments from members of the opposite sex are what, after all, is important in this life. Anyone viewing all this nonsense from another planet \\u2014 as most men do \\u2014 can be forgiven for assuming that women are a bunch of mixed up crazies who don't know what they want, but do know that they want it all, both ways and with jam on the top, too. No-one can deny that being pretty helps \\u2014 no female on breakfast television would have a career otherwise \\u2014 but I cannot believe that we are turning back to the dark days when it was deemed the most important thing of all. The recent controversies over both the Maastricht amendment and Workfare serve to betray the Conservatives' real economic aim of making Britain the low wage centre of Europe. Suggestions of obligating the unemployed to work for their benefits are quite in keeping for a Government which has done virtually everything else it can to ensure that millions of Britons will work for derisory incomes. The hobbling of trade unions, the abolition of wages councils, and the refusal to legislate for minimum pay levels demonstrate that John Major is quite willing to oversee the worsening of living standards for a large part of the population. Any Workfare or similar scheme will heighten the problem by providing a cheap labour pool which will discourage the creation of real jobs with acceptable conditions. Tied in by their own dogma, the Conservatives refuse to take any steps to build a genuine base for sustained economic growth. Unless the Government crosses this ideological barrier and invests in education, training and infrastructure, then the spiral of increasing unemployment and low pay looks likely to continue. Bland case Without in any way making light of the distress of the parents of Tony Bland, it is very important to keep a firm hold of the fact that Tony himself was not reported to be in any pain or distress; so any change in the treatment he was receiving was not for the purpose of relieving acute suffering of the patient. One must wonder, therefore, how his dignity was to be maintained by the withdrawal of feeding. The case is not entirely a private family matter since it has very serious implications for society as a whole. What we have now had thrust upon us is a precedent to hasten death, not really to help the patient die with dignity but to accommodate the judgment of others that the patient's life is no longer possessed of \\u2018quality\\u2019. A \\u2018hard case\\u2019\\u2014 and I am not disputing that for the Bland parents it is indeed a very hard case \\u2014 has been found which can, and I believe will, be skilfully exploited to justify the \\u2018dignified\\u2019 removal of a subtly-expanding range of people who will be deemed to be living lives which are below some \\u2018expert's\\u2019criterion of an acceptable standard. Prophets do not have a track record of popularity star-rating but they prove, in the end, to have seen important realities which their contemporaries failed to grasp. I believe Father James Morrow will come to be numbered among them, long after some, the currently-celebrated illuminati, have been relegated to obscurity. Gross bias Phillip Whidden (Points of View, 3 February) addresses my earlier criticism of the report by the Association of Non-Smokers Rights claiming that \\u2018passive smoking\\u2019 causes over 10,000 deaths annually in Britain. He justifies failure to cite critics of the Wells paper (on which the ANSR estimates were based) because \\u2018these critics were mistaken\\u2019. Whether or not the criticisms were mistaken (and many were not), failure even to notice them, let alone reply to them, indicates gross bias in the ANSR report. Mr Whidden cites the US Environmental Protection Agency report as support for his view that \\u2018passive smoking\\u2019 causes deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers, stating that it \\u2018ran the gauntlet of scientific criticism\\u2019. Certainly there were many criticisms of earlier drafts. I attended two open meetings in Washington in which the EPA received comments from numerous sources. It was notable that many valid criticisms, including some from its own scientific advisory board, were totally ignored in the final report. It is interesting that Mr Whidden does not cite the EPA report as regards heart disease or other cancers; diseases which contribute nearly all of the total of ANSR's spurious estimate of deaths. Could this be because the EPA, like the UK Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health, did not conclude that an effect of \\u2018passive smoking\\u2019 was demonstrated?\\u2019 It is also interesting that Mr Whidden fails to point out that no authoritative report has claimed \\u2018passive smoking\\u2019 causes chronic bronchitis in adults. The solicitors for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, which paid out \\u00a315,000 compensation to Veronica Bland, have confirmed that reports in the media may have given the false impression that such a relationship has been established. Neither, for the record, was there any admission of liability and in no way was it conceded that \\u2018passive smoking\\u2019 caused her alleged illness. The country is horrified by the upsurge in violent crime, typified by the killing of young James Bulger. But what is the cause? Brian Pendreigh explores the many arguments which lay the blame on television and films, and Audrey Gillan reports on a computer playing a vital part in the search for the Merseyside murderer Screen violence put to the test STATISTICS show violent crime is on the increase in Scotland, but we have only bald statistics. We don't have any helpful little footnote explaining why. Meanwhile, the public is not only horrified but also mystified by the killing of a two-year-old in Merseyside, last seen with two older boys. Again people are asking why, while politicians' knees are jerking frantically. Not one but two former homes secretaries have blamed television and films for what is happening in society. Lord Merlyn-Rees, a former Labour minister, suggested children are copying what they see on television, while the Conservatives' Kenneth Baker claimed children faced a moral vacuum and that television and film are at least partly to blame. Television bosses maintain they have tight controls on TV violence, while the film censor claims to operate one of the toughest regimes in the western world. Lethal Weapon 2 got a U certificate in France, but the British censor wouldn't even pass it for over-18s without some of the violence being cut. Baker expressed grave concern at the Bootle killing and attacked various institutions for the fact that society has become more violent and selfish. He suggested the Church should concentrate its message on violence rather than offering a view on the Social Chapter. There is one group that politicians seem reluctant to blame and that's themselves. There have been several cases in the past where it appeared people were acting out violent scenes from films. It was suggested the Hungerford killer Michael Ryan was influenced by the film character Rambo. But there is no evidence of such a direct link between the Bootle killing and screen violence, and many people may find such speculation insensitive and distasteful at this stage. Some maintain violent programmes do encourage violent behaviour and something needs to be done. Some argue that violent programmes are cathartic, a safe release for aggressive feelings. There's no shortage of opinions. Hard evidence is difficult to come by. Recent studies have posed the question as to whether there is a link between film violence and real violence and have come up with the answer that the majority of people think there is, though at least one study concluded the opposite. But such research only reveals people's perceptions. It doesn't evaluate whether they are right or not. John Davies, professor at Strathclyde University's Centre for Occupational and Health Psychology, says these studies merely muddy the water. He accepts it's extremely difficult to come up with conclusive evidence that violent films cause violent behaviour, but that a series of studies in America 20 years ago suggested it was a factor. The US research employed observation of children, questionnaires and long-term case studies. Nevertheless the results were highly controversial and Sue Elliott, the official in charge of children's television at Britain's Independent Television Commission watchdog, says: \\u2018Extensive research on both sides of the Atlantic has not established a clear link between watching violent television and violent behaviour.\\u2019 Many people would say that even the possibility of a link would justify action, but the ITC already has detailed restrictions and before jerking one's knee it's necessary to know the nature of the material that may be subject to cuts. Elliott says: \\u2018Television is an easy scapegoat for people's anger when inexplicable acts of violence shock society\\u2026 Politicians should hesitate before reaching for the handy \\u2018blame television\\u2019 solution. They know less about and watch less television than anyone else in the country.\\u2019 Scottish Television produces about 40 per cent of ITV children's programming. Alistair Moffat, the station's director of programmes, says: \\u2018The superheroes have gone, He-Man and wham-bang-crash has gone\\u2026 The shows that top the ratings are soft, for example we make Rupert the Bear and that gets a 60 per cent share of the kids\\u2019 audience.\\u2019 Older children prefer humour to violence, says Moffat, and when it comes to watching adult television, they like nothing better than soaps like Neighbours and Home and Away, which may tackle tough issues, but approach them with a certain old-fashioned morality, and contain little violence. Anything shown before 9pm is regarded as family viewing and Elliott says the ITC has done extensive research on The Bill, a police drama, to check the impact on its sizeable audience of children. Moffat reckons the real cause for concern is satellite television and video. \\u2018Some kids will take the video club membership card out of mum's purse and will go and get Texas Chainsaw Massacre and play it on video.\\u2019 EXCEPT they won't. Leonard Maltin is just one respected American critic who regards it as a \\u2018classic and influential suspense-comic-horror film\\u2019, but it's banned both on video and in the cinema in this country. James Ferman, director of the British Board of Film Classification, says: \\u2018We are one of the most censorious countries in the world regarding violence. We are very concerned about violence and always have been.\\u2019 This is in spite of the fact that he believes there's no evidence that watching violence on screen leads to violence in real life. \\u2018There are some cases where the link appears to be quite close. Sometimes it's a matter of the drip, drip, drip effect and seeing too much violence and not being as sensitive to violence as one should be. Certainly our classification policy is very much based on what kind of violence is safe to be seen at various ages.\\u2019 Although media attention has focused on specific films, such as Reservoir Dogs, which show graphically realistic instances of violence, it may be the more routine violence of the Lethal Weapon and Die Hard action movies that should be causing most concern. The hero uses violence in an almost casual way and the consequences are never properly addressed. It's a type of violence that falls between realism and fantasy. The ITC guidelines make it clear that it doesn't see \\u2018sanitised\\u2019 violence as innocuous and Ferman expresses greater concern about Lethal Weapon 2 than Reservoir Dogs. Ferman believes every possible factor must be considered after the Bootle killing, including films but also parental responsibility. \\u2018One of the things that worries me is too many parents allow their kids to see videos classified 15 or 18. Something has to be done about it to make parents realise that these are classified as unsuitable for children because they genuinely are unsuitable for children.\\u2019 Davies says there is some evidence to suggest that showing the consequences of violence is preferable to not doing so. But he feels it all has an effect, including Tom and Jerry, which is after all non-stop violence. He recalls that US researchers came up with a list of programmes of which they approved, including The Waltons, and those of which they disapproved, including the old Batman series, with its camp humour and captions saying \\u2018Pow\\u2019 when he punched the baddie. Pressed on whether he would ban Tom and Jerry, Davies says he wouldn't. He recalls one study suggested that if you present youngsters with a diet of relentlessly insipid programmes then that in itself may stir up aggressive tendencies and encourage violence. Addressing aggression: the British censor wouldn't pass Lethal Weapon 2 for over-18s without some of the violence being cut CENTRAL Edinburgh does not, at a glance, look like an unemployment blackspot. It appears prosperous, with busy corner shops, crowded pubs and numerous restaurants and take-aways. But pick any street and the curse of unemployment lurks behind the front doors. Take St Leonard's Bank, looking out on to Salisbury Crags \\u2014 a quiet, well-maintained residential street about half-a-mile from the Royal Mile. At one end is a row of tenements, in the middle are stone family houses and at the far end a council-run hostel for people with alcohol-related problems. We examined how unemployment has hit its mixture of families, students, retired people and young professionals. The majority are employed, but about a fifth have suffered a period of unemployment in the past. Most agreed the experience had dented their confidence and morale, leaving lasting memories of isolation and frustration. St Leonard's Bank falls within the boundary of the St Giles ward, where unemployment stands at 19 per cent: the problem is growing. According to Edinburgh District Council, this is typical of the capital's centre, where hostels, students and young people are prevalent. But although the ward's unemployment rate is higher than the city average of 12 per cent, the council says the real unemployment blackspots are still the peripheral housing schemes. Edinburgh University's professor of social policy and social work, Adrian Sinfield, says the heaviest burden of unemployment is still hitting poor people in poorer areas. However \\u2014 as we found down St Leonard's Bank \\u2014 other sectors of the Edinburgh community are not immune. Lack of jobs \\u2018leading to new underclass' No.1: MARTIN COWAN, 48, is a musical instrument technology student who is well aware that his own particular skills may not be in demand when he finishes his training. He believes that unemployment is socially divisive and is leading to the creation of an underclass. However, he thinks the suggestion of a workfare programme might help the long-term unemployed if it were relevant to the skills that are needed to find work. No.2: HANS Wagenknecht, 24, is a physics student from Germany who will be looking for work in a few years. \\u2018Unemployment is higher in Scotland than in Germany and I think it's a lot worse here than in the rest of Britain.\\u2019 \\u2018In Germany there is more emphasis on technical skills and I learned bricklaying while completing my education. \\u2018However, life in Germany, whether you're working or not, is more stressful and aggressive than over here and I don't think students here appreciate what they have.\\u2019 No.14: JENNY HEAD, 37, is a part-time shiatsu [massage]therapist and her husband, Mike Fourman, 42, a computer science professor at Edinburgh University. \\u2018Neither of us have been made redundant but I am aware of unemployment and its effects. \\u2018I've heard from my husband about graduates not getting jobs, even with a degree in computer science.\\u2019 She says working as a shiatsu therapist is also risky because the treatment is expensive and people are not always willing to pay when money is short. Where the champagne lost its fizz By Gillian Harris NOT so long ago Bill Bentley's wine-bar in Bishopsgate was alive to the sound of mobile phones and chattering stockbrokers. Champagne was guzzled like lemonade and flexible friends took care of the bill. Since those heady days the bar and its clientele have undergone a transformation. Heavy job losses in the City have had a huge impact on the lifestyles of people working in the finance sector. Those who have escaped so far wait nervously, fearing the worst. In the first six weeks of this year, 10,500 redundancies were announced in the United Kingdom financial sector. According to the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, the future looks gloomier still. \\u2018Considering that we have been looking at 30,000 job losses a year recently, this could be the worst year ever. It has certainly been a bad start,\\u2019 said Richard Lynch in BIFU's London office. From the end of the Eighties, when unemployment in the City was negligible, the number of people out of work in the Square Mile has climbed steadily. In December 1991 there were 112,000 unemployed. A year later it had jumped to 149,000 and looks set to rise again this year. For Remo Mongiat, the manager of Bill Bentley's, the changes forced some hurried menu alterations: whole lobster has been replaced by haddock, vintage French wine by cheaper plonk. \\u2018The amount people will spend on lunch has dropped drastically,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018In 1988 someone would come in and spend \\u00a340 per head without even looking at the bill. Now they would pay no more than that on a meal for two.\\u2019 Champagne, the tipple of the Eighties, is shunned as hedonistic and not in keeping with the belt-tightening Nineties. \\u2018Nowadays the only time anyone orders champagne is if it is their birthday,\\u2019 mourned Mr Mongiat. \\u2018I try to keep prices to a bare minimum so as to still allow people to have lunch without spending a fortune. We want to look after our customers so that they will be around when things get better.\\u2019 However, not everyone believes things will get better. Derek Edwards, the managing director of Sanders and Sidney, a management consultancy firm, thinks the changes taking place go beyond recessionary cuts. \\u2018Whole levels of management have disappeared,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Partly that has been caused by the recession but it has also been triggered by technological advances. The City has been hit by hi-tech, probably more than other employment sectors.\\u2019 Mr Edwards also detects caution in employers who are recruiting: \\u2018They hire people for a specific period, maybe one or two years, so that at the end of that time they can decide whether or not to renew their contract or make them redundant. There is a move away from jobs for life.\\u2019 Employees who do lose their jobs are also no longer guaranteed a generous redundancy package. Mr Edwards said: \\u2018There was a time when bonuses would be generous and the person might work several months notice. \\u2018Now packages are being refined and people are being asked to leave more quickly. It is partly the recession and partly companies taking a realistic look at how much they can afford.\\u2019 Many of the people who were made redundant during the first wave of financial job losses in 1990 have found work in other fields. Administrative posts have been snapped up by stockbrokers and merchant bankers. \\u2018Nobody feels secure any more,\\u2019 said Mr Edwards. \\u2018Younger people coming into jobs now have a different attitude. They do not regard it as offensive to say they want a quality of life more than they want challenge and promotion.\\u2019 THE UNEMPLOYED No.4, top floor: NATALIE HUNTER, 27, has been unemployed since December after working as a graphic designer for four years. She is looking for work and thinks she may be forced to move to London in search of a job. She has also considered re-training and thought about enrolling for a college course. She feels the worst part of being unemployed is her inability to plan for the future. \\u2018At first it was quite good having loads of time, and money wasn't really a problem, I just stopped buying things. However, it's easy to get a very negative self-image and lose your confidence. \\u2018It's still a social stigma to be unemployed and employers wonder what you've been doing.\\u2019 She is appalled by the suggestion that the unemployed should work for their dole money. \\u2018It's really terrible. People should be entitled to basic benefits.\\u2019 No.4, ground floor: ELECTRA SCORGIE, 33, is an unemployed rock musician who is attending a training course on computers. An American who has lived in Britain for 15 years, she has experienced the \\u2018devastating\\u2019 effects of unemployment. \\u2018If you're forced to live on benefits you're thrown on to such a low level that you can't dress properly for interviews or even afford the travel involved. \\u2018You don't have the sort of upbeat good humour you need to compete for jobs. \\u2018There doesn't seem to be any safety net for laying people off and there is the belief put about by certain politicians that full employment would cause inflation to rise. It's all very manipulative.\\u2019 She feels people in Scotland who have lost their jobs are not so eager to find work because wages are low, whereas in the States people are prepared to do two or three part-time jobs to support themselves. She is not impressed at the concept of working for dole money and says it might be a better idea to give people a minimum wage for doing community work. No.24 THE SIX residents of Thornybauk hostel for those with alcohol-related problems are all unemployed and will begin looking for work once they have dealt with their difficulties. Hamish Reilly, 35, worked for an electronics firm in Livingston before moving into the hostel 14 months ago. He is not optimistic about his chances of getting another job in electronics and says he would consider doing something else. \\u2018There are a lot of people out there looking, it's a bit of a joke really.\\u2019 Morag French, 27, is more optimistic about a job, although she did experience a few brief spells of unemployment before entering the hostel a year and a half ago. No.2, first floor: LISA, 18, is a student of English who has been unemployed twice, including being made redundant when only 16. \\u2018Unemployment is really degrading, I felt like I wanted to spend money all the time to cheer myself up, but of course I didn't have anything left over from my bridging allowance. My mum helped me out a bit, but not everyone has parents who will help. The Government should back up young people more because there are those who have to leave home.\\u2019 \\u2018Even if you get a flat you worry about delays in your housing benefit. It's all right if you've got a nice landlord who'll wait for the payment to come through. \\u2018If not it's just another hassle you face if you're on the dole.\\u2019 No.4, ground floor: GILLIAN LEDSON, 19, is a retail business student who has had the experience of being made unemployed twice in five weeks. Her summer job at Harrods in London lasted only one week after poor sales in the sports department meant she was no longer needed. Working in Habitat on Kings Road proved to be depressingly similar and again Ms Ledson was paid off, that time after three weeks. \\u2018Unemployment is very likely to cause people a lot of stress and I feel quite concerned about how depressed friends can become when unemployed. \\u2018I don't think people should have to work for their dole money, although some sort of \\u2018workfare\\u2019 programme might help some people in terms of references or whatever.\\u2019 No.4: ROGER LINTON, 27, is manager of Dunbar's tourist information centre and was unemployed for three and a half months before finding a job. \\u2018Although he feels his job is secure in spite of forthcoming local government reorganisation, he has not forgotten how his brief spell of unemployment affected him. \\u2018There are two sides to unemployment, on the one hand it can be a productive time as you start to question things and think harder about what road you want to go down. \\u2018However, it can also make you disorientated and you start to apply for less and less appropriate jobs as you get desperate. You start to see yourself in terms of an application form.\\u2019 Like others in the street, he is not enchanted with the idea of working for dole money. \\u2018To me it sounds similar to youth training schemes \\u2014 a disgrace. \\u2018Some sort of scheme would be reasonable, but only if there was training involved and a decent wage.\\u2019 No.11: DIANE LECKIE, 39, is divorced, with a daughter and works as a teacher. She vividly recalls being made redundant several years ago. \\u2018I felt devastated at losing my job. I had gone through a marriage break-up and had a lot of financial commitments.\\u2019 \\u2018I had worked in recruitment so I knew what I was in for: it can be a nightmare.\\u2019 She feels there is a real shortage of teaching jobs and says if she were to lose her job tomorrow she would want to do something. \\u2018I would try and turn my hand to anything but it must be very hard if you leave school at 15.\\u2019 No.12: MATHEW REA works in Edinburgh University's chemical engineering department and his wife Jenny Haslam works as a part-time social worker. They have two young children and moved to Edinburgh after Mr Rea experienced difficulty in finding work in Sheffield. He says being unemployed meant feeling cut off. \\u2018One of the things I missed was having access to things like phones and being able to make contacts.\\u2019 His wife mentions lack of status. Mr Rea says jobs at universities are no longer as secure as they once were. \\u2018People are often taken on short-term contracts, proper jobs are very hard to come by. There are a lot of very qualified people who can only find work on a short-term basis.\\u2019 Swedish lesson J R Hall (Points of View, 12 February) is right to suggest that British Rail would be able to make a profit if the Government took full responsibility for funding the provision and maintenance of railway infrastructure as it does roads. This view is substantiated by experience in Sweden, where such an arrangement has existed since 1988. As a result, the state railways turned a loss of 416 million  kroner (about \\u00a340 million) that year into a profit of 28 million  kroner the following year, which grew to 372 million  kroner in 1990 and is expected to go on rising. The state railways pay a user charge to the track authority, which is broadly equivalent to the charges faced by road users and covers only about a third of total infrastructure costs. So successful has the state system been that it has lost only about 1 per cent of its operations to a private competitor under the system of tendering for the provision of local passenger services that was also introduced by the 1988 rail reforms. It is misleading, therefore, of the Government to hold up Sweden as a model for its madcap rail privatisation plans. Indeed, Swedish railway executives have publicly condemned the proposals as unworkable. Town allergies Professor A Seaton suggests (Points of View, today) that the Rev J L Leckie's view that traffic pollution has caused the rise in the prevalence of asthma in Aberdeen school-children is simplistic. But Mr Leckie must be partly right. Professor Robert Davies, of Bart's, has pointed out that exhaust pollution explains the curious fact that city dwellers these days are more affected by hay fever than those in the country. Both these allergic conditions have the same underlying cause: a dysfunctioning immune system. Therefore all immunosuppressive factors can play a part. These include chemical allergens (exhaust fumes and tobacco smoke among them), food allergens (too often overlooked by asthma specialists), and physical and psychological stress. Their effects are cumulative; there is no single answer in cell-mediated allergy. The problem of congestion on the Forth Road Bridge and on the approaches to Edinburgh remains unresolved. Some people suggest that the removal of tolls would help to solve the difficulties to a great extent. They may well be right, but are unable to prove their point. Let us suspend the tolls for a period of say, 14 days, so that we can all see if they are right. If they are, there will be no need for an extra bridge and the projected cost of a second bridge could be used to strengthen the present structure. Compared with the billions being spent out of the road fund in England to make the motorways even wider, the cost would be chicken-feed. Infallible way to obtain release from military service As a former National Service army medical officer, I was much entertained by Albert Morris's reminiscences (\\u2018Conscripts who altered the script\\u2019, 8 February), of the various ingenious methods used by unwilling conscripts to obtain their discharge from the service. Having spent some weeks in 1951 as medical officer to a basic training regiment in Aldershot, I recall with amusement many of the subterfuges and deceptions described by Albert Morris. However, I am surprised that he failed to mention persistent bed-wetting which, in my experience, was the one absolutely infallible method of obtaining release from military service. During my time in the army a regimental quartermaster who was repeatedly having to exchange soiled blankets would protest so vehemently to his commanding officer that drastic action had to be taken. This initially meant that the bed-wetter would be made to sleep in the guard-room, where during the night he would be wakened hourly for toilet purposes. If after perhaps two weeks of this regimen the bed-wetting continued, then the enuretic National Serviceman would probably be referred by the unit medical officer to the local military hospital for exclusion of urological, neurological or psychiatric disorders. This process, of course, usually meant several hospital visits, with consequent very welcome respite from tiresome and disagreeable activities such as drill parades, guard duties, cookhouse fatigues and physical training. These medical investigations hardly ever revealed any physical or mental abnormality and if the bed-wetter continued thereafter to deplete the quartermaster's stock of blankets then the British Army had no answer to this situation other than to discharge him honourably from the service without a stain on his character, whatever there might be on his bedclothes. I do not know how the RAF dealt with bed-wetters in the days of National Service, but I am certain that even although the Royal Navy had abandoned hammocks not long after the Second World War, a persistent enuretic on board a warship would create even more serious problems than he could in an army barracks. Workers' rights It can only be a reliance on public ignorance that can allow the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, and other Tories, to spread lies about the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Hurd has talked about these articles as if they were about the imposition of old East European \\u2018socialism\\u2019(with Chancellor Kohl leading the way?). Article 2, which sets out the general areas of workers' rights, simply spells out many rights that already exist in law, or have been present in well-unionised work places for years before Thatcherism. Article 6 reinforces the legal rights on equal pay obtained by women in this country, in 1970. Without any exaggeration, it would be true to say that, apart from Tory ideologues, the overwhelming majority of people in this country would agree to this legislation, if they were given the chance to read it and in more simple terms. The Tories, and their ruling-class supporters, wish to keep the ordinary worker from knowing what the substance of this social chapter is, how it really just gives more backing to much of what they have already gained through industrial struggles for nearly 200 years, and the extension of these rights to every worker, especially the more isolated ones. The Tories want to trample over the workers, particularly through the instrument of unemployment which has already frightened workers into accepting wage cuts such as at Cambuslang. The social chapter would not provide any protection here as pay policy is excluded, apart from the equal pay issue; but in terms of social security and employment conditions, it would be an important advance. However, what is most galling is the inactivity of the party which is supposed to represent labour. A high-powered focus on this issue, alongside the campaign on the health service, would undoubtedly have won the Labour Party the general election. Bridge across Labour's class divide Should he stay or should he go? Labour needs Tom Clarke to remain shadow Scottish secretary, says Peter Jones AT least one Labour MP, and probably a few more, think that Labour leader John Smith should ditch his troubled shadow Scottish secretary Tom Clarke, who went back to work in January after a three-month illness and promptly inflicted two unnecessary controversies upon himself. That Labour MP is, however, bound to be disappointed. It is not in Smith's interests, or the Labour Party's, for Clarke to be summarily dispatched like some allegedly politically incorrect Daily Mirror employee. For the issue at stake is not necessarily whether Clarke is good or bad at his job, something which is indeed a topic of conversation among MPs, not just among the media's \\u2018very well-paid political hacks\\u2019, as Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood asserted this week. It has much more to do with control of the party's thinking and its power structures; the debate about modernisation of ideology and whether or not the Scottish party should become more or less independent of the rest of the UK Labour Party. These debates, especially the ideological one, are difficult enough for Smith to manage, and they would get worse in Scotland if Clarke was put to the sword. They would also be worse than the ruckus stirred up by Clarke's remarks on firstly, the improbability of Labour being able to renationalise a privatised water industry, and secondly, the worthlessness of the Scottish financial industry. The first was a mistake which, all politicians will tell you, is easily made and relatively simple to correct with a few carefully worded statements and some abuse of the media. The second is not so easy to explain away, for it implied a fundamental incomprehension of the financial industry, many of whose 200,000 employees are Labour voters in marginal Edinburgh seats. And it is that point which has raised questions in the minds of some MPs who hitherto have been relatively happy with Clarke. Still, one bad speech does not merit a sacking. And although there are some MPs who think Clarke should go now to prevent any worse gaffes, it is only on past events rather than future possibilities that such decisions can be made. And certainly there would be the most almighty row if Clarke got the push. What was interesting about those MPs who were swift to defend him was that they come from the traditional working-class wing of the parliamentary party \\u2014 people like Jimmy Hood, or Aberdeen North's Bob Hughes. Now they are the sort of MPs who are most likely to support traditional Labour policies, which Clarke, on the hypothetical question of water renationalisation, was implicitly rejecting. Clearly, on the evidence of Hood's letters of defence in the press this week, they support him, not because of what he says, but because of what he is \\u2014 from, and still part of, a traditional working-class background. According to Hood, the criticisms of Clarke are \\u2018born from jealousy and political snobbery\\u2019. It has to be said that there has been for some years within the Labour Party something of a class divide \\u2014 a working-class element resentful of a middle-class takeover by lawyers and the like. The divide has been bridged in a number of ways, one being shadow Cabinet elections putting people like Tom Clarke or John Prescott into the upper echelons. Neil Kinnock also bridged that divide, but John Smith is definably and obviously on the middle-class side of it. Smith therefore needs people like Tom Clarke in the shadow Cabinet. Turf him out of it, and the debate between \\u2018traditionalists\\u2019 and \\u2018modernisers\\u2019could well turn into a conflagration. The row over what Labour would do with the water industry is a graphic first flare-up in that debate. It is potentially hugely divisive given the Scottish party's left-wing sensibilities, but less so if working-class traditionalists like Clarke can go down Smith's route to modernity. The water debate, when couched in terms of the Scottish party's rights to determine policy in specifically Scottish areas, also directly affects the current internal demands for more Scottish party autonomy, even unto independence. This argument, that the Scottish party should elect its own leader, raise its own funds, hire and fire its own staff and sit in a Westminster coalition with the English and Welsh Labour Party, is something which acutely interests a few hundred activists, but not many MPs, and one guesses, precious few voters. But if John Smith was cavalierly hiring and firing the shadow Scottish secretary, some more MPs might start taking an interest, which would be wholly  undesirable in the leader's office. So Clarke will stay. But he has done himself some damage and will need to work hard, and with some care, if he is to secure re-election to the shadow Cabinet in November. For, according to the soundings taken by The Scotsman this week, he would not win re-election now. \\u2018For a lot of the mums it's a chance to do the day over again' Here comes the bride\\u2026probably in a coach and four, and cocooned in all the marital candyfloss that is now \\u2018de rigueur\\u2019 for the perfect day, writes Joan McAlpine All the frills of the fair Pictures by DAVID MITCHELL THE thinning man with the single red rose and the worried expression is resigned to his fate as father of the bride. \\u2018We're not talking swans in the bath at this stage. But I don't expect much change out of \\u00a36,000.\\u2019 His pal looks slightly shocked. \\u2018Six thou! You'll be lucky. Do you want a bargain?\\u2019 Ian and John are among the very few unchaperoned males attending the second Scottish Bridal Fair. Still only 39, Ian confesses to adoring his wife \\u2014 hence the silk rose for Valentine's Day \\u2014 and a determination to put the love boat out in style when his 20-year-old daughter gets married next year. Wouldn't he prefer the blushing apple of his eye to do the decent thing? Shack up with her boyfriend and save daddy a fortune? Or she could at least get it over in the registry office with a couple of rounds of Spanish bubbly in the pub later? \\u2018Oh no, it serves the marriage well if it's built on something. She's my only daughter and I took out an endowment for her at birth in preparation for this. It should be a day to remember. \\u2018I'm determined to do it right. If I had \\u00a340 million I'd get Spielberg over to direct the video!\\u2019 Ian may be a romantic, but the cupids and violins have not quite destroyed his sense of the absurd. He freely admits the increasing extravagance of the average suburban wedding has more to do with keeping up with the girl in the semi next door than sticking to tradition. \\u2018I agree it's all: \\u2018Jenny got a coach and four so we'll get six\\u2019\\u2026 We're going down the path of our US cousins, where they have wedding co-ordinators running round the garden marquee with walkie talkies. Fortunately our family isn't at that stage.\\u2019 Judging by the display of satin and tat at the Scottish Exhibition Centre last week, we are in grave danger of being swallowed in a cloud of marital candyfloss which could only be born in the USA. Remember the days when a big do was a white dress made by the bride, the luxury of one bridesmaid and a spread of sandwiches in the Co-operative Halls afterwards? Neither do I. Tradition is being manufactured at breakneck pace. Perhaps it's because so many people are opting not to bother. The wedding industry has to get as much cash as possible out of the remaining couples who choose to tie the knot with the blessing of God and every florist in Britain. They are all here today. The bakers of wedding cakes and purveyors of finest Champagne. Thinking of tossing your bouquet in younger sister's direction? Forget it. Too cheap by far. Why not get it pressed by Bonnyton Designs of Eastwood? Then display it in the nice rosewood frame above the mantelpiece in that new home you're now too poor to furnish? And when we run out of local traditions to invent, we can import from abroad. Italia Roselli runs the Bonbonniere Shop in Airdrie. The good folk of Lanarkshire just cannot get enough of the Italian favours she makes with sugar almonds and layers of lace. Roselli, aged 50, is a handsome, sallow woman with a delicate blue rinse. Today she wears a Moschino-style blouse in splashes of primary canary and scarlet \\u2014 a refreshing contrast to the oppressive pastels all around us. Her own stand is dominated by a burst of swansdown in shades of pink ranging from cerise to baby blush. There is a 2ft-high basket full of favours (48 in total) for the ladies attending a wedding next Saturday. At \\u00a33 a go, this little bit of Naples will cost you \\u00a3150. It will probably cost the bridesmaid a lot more in back pain by the time she distributes them round the hall. But it doesn't end there. Just as Mrs Roselli's almonds have become de rigueur at every decent bash, a new element is being made indispensable. \\u2018The ladies at the top table get something special that they can keep. We give them a little trinket box or a ring holder, it's traditional,\\u2019 she explains, in a charmingly deliberate Scots Italian voice. She twirls a shimmering gold swan studded with imitation pearls \\u2018for her dressing table\\u2019. Fashion even dictates the changing shape of cakes. \\u2018Over the past few years it's been your petal frilly or your heart-shaped frilly. Peach and cream, definitely ,\\u2019 says Evelyn Hogarth of Top Tier designer cakes in Glasgow's douce Hyndland district. Three tiers from Evelyn, complete with botanically correct, handmade sugar flowers \\u2014 you can get them to match your bouquet \\u2014 will cost \\u00a3300. Or you might prefer a Rennie Mackintosh square to complement your customised, Glasgow-style gown and stationery. Hogarth also makes a miniature, three-tier \\u2018recession beater\\u2019, but has had little interest so far. People want to spend their day forgetting about hard times \\u2014 even if they pay it off in instalments over the next ten years. \\u2018Twenty years ago when I got married you could only get squares with royal icing and gold stuck all over them. Now there is so much variety.\\u2019 One of her most popular lines is \\u2018Top Table\\u2019, which has fondue icing models of the wedding party sitting down to celebrate. She usually makes the little figures to resemble the couple and their entourage. \\u2018I had a girl whose dog was the bridesmaid. I didn't realise she was getting married in the church opposite the shop until I saw the life-size versions of the figures appear one morning \\u2014 including this labrador in a pink dress!\\u2019 AH, the dress. Sensible girls are hiring them these days. After all, what can you do in a full-length silk dupion with cabbage roses and silver applique? Cut it down, dye it red and press it into service for that next dinner dance? Not any more. Modern fairy tale dresses are unwearable in any other context. Hiring the dress of your dreams from Glitterati in Bell Street, Glasgow, will cost anything between \\u00a375 and \\u00a3325. If you think that's a bit steep, consider the cost of the kind you keep. Anything from \\u00a3500 to \\u00a32,500. \\u2018Younger girls go for the full frilly dresses. A girl in her late twenties, or early thirties will want something a bit more stylish and fitted,\\u2019 advises Betty from Glitterati. And if your old school pal would like you to carry the train, now is the time to make your excuses. \\u2018For bridesmaids hyacinth and coral are the colours of the season. People are fed up with your peaches.\\u2019 In Scotland we have our own particular marital madness. If nothing else, the jamboree has done wonders for the national dress. Kiltmakers have never been so popular with men who are not members of pipe bands. But have you ever tried to find a garter in Tweedie tartan? \\u2018We get all sorts of requests to match the husband's kilt. Tartan is getting more popular every year,\\u2019 says the lady from Norma Stewart's bridalwear. But it's not just the bride who must be pampered. There's the important matter of the \\u2018mother of the bride\\u2019. All eyes are upon her, apparently, when they are not cooing over her daughter. She cannot afford to make a mistake so she must leave herself to the administrations of Lady G, June's of Hamilton or Gina Smart in Ayr. Gina is wearing a satin waistcoat in red and imperial purple with a matching skirt. She understands the disasters ladies encounter with co-ordination. \\u2018They can make dreadful mistakes with their hats. That's where we come in,\\u2019 she says in hushed tones. \\u2018Quite often the mother of the groom and the mother of the bride come in together because we can make sure they compliment each other. We take them by the hand. They need expert advice after all. When we are finished, they are each matching from head to toe. It's got to be a complete day.\\u2019 She points to a pair of pewter leather stilettos on her mannequin. \\u2018We can give ladies something that's a little bit different,\\u2019 says Gina. GINA thinks the Royal weddings of the Eighties gave a real boost to \\u2018occasion wear\\u2019. Does she think the Royal divorces of the Nineties will hit business? \\u2018No, people still want to make a splash for their daughters. For a lot of the mums it's a chance to do the day over again.\\u2019 But how many Sixties and Seventies brides had to wrestle with a \\u00a3500 stationery bill after the confetti had settled? These days it's not enough to send out the invite and hope they reply. Jackie from Marriage Lines takes us through day and evening invitations embossed with clinking champagne flutes and bordered in watered silk. You simply must have matching place cards: \\u2018How else would the guests know were to sit?\\u2019 And your Order of Service? A must. Polite brides will hand out more cards to thank guests for sharing their special day. And a napkin ring with the couple's entwined names is such a nice touch. The girls who pile into the exhibition centre are usually accompanied by a flock of female relatives. Lesley, 25, a clerkess from Greenock, is with her mother, aunt and two sisters. Her mother Margaret disapproves of fancy weddings and strongly disapproves of evening invitations. \\u2018If you invite someone, you invite them for the whole day.\\u2019 Still, she will have all the traditional trappings, including four bridesmaids. \\u2018My cousin's coming from Canada.\\u2019 Doesn't she fancy a horse-drawn carriage from Ayrshire Equitation \\u2014 just \\u00a3200 including coachman and attendants? \\u2018If I left that at the door of St Joe's in Greenock it wouldn't be there when I came out,\\u2019 chirps Lesley. She trips off to view the fashion show. She quite fancies one of the new empire lines. We mingle with the ladies in black velvet evening gloves selling Moet and the photographer promising to make the plain into cover girls for a day. Brides with \\u2018Grace Kelly\\u2019 necklines glide along the passageways, making way for 20 year-olds modelling mother-of-the-bride outfits in startling shades of violet. One stand is missing the love hearts and lace. It has an enticing colour photograph of palm trees and white sand. They are selling holidays in Fiji, where you can marry in a grass skirt \\u2014 free from interfering relatives and fussy frills. They do not have many takers. Setting a peaceful precedent JOHN HOME ROBERTSON WORDS and pictures cannot describe the disaster that is unfolding in former Yugoslavia. History will deliver a harsh judgment on the politicians and warlords who are fermenting this chaos but I doubt if there are enough prison cells in Europe to hold all the war criminals. And we should not forget that ham-fisted European diplomacy contributed to the re-balkanisation of the Balkans by hastening to recognise unrecognisable states. We cannot abandon people to the horrors of primitive siege warfare, so the ramshackle institutions of the United Nations will have to be drastically overhauled to cope with this crisis and others like it which are festering in an increasingly unstable world. The official mandate of the United Nations Protection Force is to \\u2018ride shotgun\\u2019 with relief convoys, but the British battalion has stretched that mandate into a peacemaking role. It is no criticism of the French, Spanish, Canadian and other contingents that the circumstances in their sectors have not permitted such tactics, but if the Vance-Owen plan is to be implemented we will need to apply the pro-active approach which is being pioneered by the Cheshire Regiment. Characteristically, and with the benefit of years of experience in Ulster, this UK infantry regiment has extended its presence and its influence well beyond its camps and convoys. Their supporting Engineers are making roads, rebuilding bridges and the Cheshires are imposing their influence on local factions by both persuasion and force. That has meant returning fire to suppress Croats and others who fire on the UN force. It has also involved brokering deals to reduce tension in other areas. This, together with patrolling and gathering intelligence about the area, means that the UK element of UNPROFOR is doing the groundwork for implementation of the Vance-Owen settlement plan. That has been achieved despite the restricted terms of the UN Resolution; despite hopelessly inadequate and confused UN structures; and also despite the half-hearted attitude of British ministers at the outset. But for the initiative of General Morillon and his transplanted European NATO staff, and of the individual units in UNPROFOR and various aid agencies, the whole operation would be hopelessly bogged down. Indeed, it is going to be bogged down unless the UN can get things moving with political and military action to make the peace plan work. Things are bad enough now but if there is no sign of progress towards a settlement, the people who are still giving friendly waves to UN troops are likely to start throwing stones as they do in Northern Ireland. The UN must start driving the momentum towards peace. Indeed if they fail to take the initiative they might as well abandon the people of the area to a grim fate. Two things are required: substantially more UN forces, almost certainly including Americans, and a UN supremo with direct authority from the Secretary General to drive the political, diplomatic, humanitarian and military process forward. While US forces are needed, Yugoslavia is no place for a massive \\u2018Stormin' Norman\\u2019 style of operation. The terrain and the highly armed militias would soon remind them of Vietnam. The Americans would be well advised to learn from the British and others who have experience in the area. And the operation must be seen to be multinational, so the UK contingent should ideally be increased to brigade strength \\u2014 which underlines the case for reprieving the Highland regiments. The need for better coordination cannot be overstated. With inadequate communications between UN units, rudimentary command and control structures, governments interpreting the UN resolution in different ways, relief supplies being administered through a totally separate UN agency, and the Vance-Owen initiative developing at another level altogether, it is hardly surprising that the international effort can appear confused. Boutros Boutros-Ghali must get the Security Council to agree an effective new Resolution and to appoint a special representative with comprehensive authority to do whatever is necessary to make a settlement work. A top flight soldier with diplomatic skills would fit the bill. We have avoided mass starvation in former Yugoslavia this winter; some time has been bought and soldiers and relief agencies have begun to develop strategies to begin to restore order. It is vital that the United Nations should now act on that groundwork and drive the peacemaking process forward. It is going to be difficult and expensive, but the only alternative is to abandon millions of people to an even worse fate. If the UN can set a precedent for peacemaking in the Balkans we will have a real peace dividend. John Home Robertson is Labour MP for East Lothian Hoover: he merchandised the invented notion of the G-Men, the Feds from the FBI J Edgar Hoover was America's top cop, is honoured as a national hero, but now the secret's out. Michael Pye reports on the truth about the G-Man The dirt on Hoover THEY'RE running the director of the FBI out of town as I write. William Webster stands accused of making phone calls on the company's phones, lending his limo to his wife, taking holidays on official planes and official time. These irregularities amount, say his bosses at the Justice Department, to a scandal. They must have forgotten Hoover. J Edgar Hoover led the FBI from 1924 until 1971 \\u2014 the nation's top cop, a movie-house hero, presiding over incorruptible straight arrows who saved America from Commies, thugs, hoodlums and perverts. He's honoured as a national hero, he has a shrine in a Washington Masonic temple, he carried to his grave the tributes and the written gratitude of every president he ever served (at least one, Gerald Ford, was his informer; so was Ronald Reagan). He was a keeper and dealer in secrets; it's not surprising the truth about him has emerged only slowly. But with Anthony Summers's new book, Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J Edgar Hoover, we have at last everything everyone says about J Edgar Hoover, including some of the wilder tales. It claims more originality than it packs, but it is still a primer in the gap between actual virtue, and the official kind. For Hoover didn't just make phone calls, or misuse a limo. He had his house painted by the FBI Exhibits Section, listed his black servants as FBI agents, profited from books he had FBI employees write under his name. His agents were as incorruptible, untouchable as any police force in the world; but Hoover bet with the Mob, took stock market favours, took free holidays from dubious businessmen. He could be hysterical, and he kept power well into senility. He faked much of his struggle with the gangsters, and failed in his wartime duty to fight imminent subversion; after the war, his genius was to stir up subversion he could quash. He manufactured information and leaked it, sometimes ruining people. And he was obsessed with deviants, with queers \\u2014 this man with prissy steps and heavy perfume. The male nudes in his parlour were balanced carefully by female ones in the games room. His office desk was supplied with Playboy as well as more esoteric porn. But, Summers insists, his deputy Clyde Tolson was also his lover. The two men took lunch and dinner together every day, went on holiday together, were seen (once, and 50 years ago, by one person) holding hands in a limo; the evidence is only circumstantial. But Summers suggests, ambitiously, that there was solid evidence which, he claims, was what stopped Hoover tackling the Mob before it came to awesome power in America. Perhaps the hero cop was blackmailed into letting crime really pay. Summers is assiduous in research, but less interested in politics; there are sides of Hoover's story whose ordinariness he misses because he finds them so shocking. But one theme does emerge from this, as from other Hoover biographies in the past two years. J Edgar Hoover was the cop who hated liberty. We're still suffering from the liberties he took. CONSIDER what J Edgar Hoover did for freedom. He card-indexed half a million radicals just after the First World War, sent agents to intimidate newspapers which dared suggest, in the Thirties, that the banks were not entirely sound, arrested fighters in the Spanish Civil War long after the war was done. He sent his men to infiltrate homosexual groups and smoke out deviants. His agents leaned on lowly college professors to stay away from groups Hoover didn't like; otherwise their files went to their colleges, full of raw gossip. He recorded Martin Luther King with women, and then tried, astoundingly, to present King as a homosexual. Perhaps he wanted to feel this moral force of a man was really no better, no finer than him. He inflamed the Black Panthers to violence and encouraged the Jewish Defence League to violence against the Black Panthers. He tried to arm anti-war activists in the Vietnam era. He investigated feminists as subversives. For he was terrified of social change, any change. Paranoia was a passion with him and he knew, just knew, the worst. If the radicals couldn't think of something violent to do, his men would make suggestions. If his targets weren't killers, he'd send guns. From the start of his authority to investigate subversives, in 1939, the pattern was set: his first raids caught an unlovely bunch of anti-Semites, whose inspiration and weapons both came from a paid FBI informant. His campaign lasted 50 years, deforming American politics, imposing a queasy notion of Americanism that was very close to 19th century nativism. Its roots were personal as well as political. Hoover was a meticulous, fussy man, determinedly cold, who thought control was the condition of his survival. As a boy, friends said he was in love with the cadet corps. As a man, he followed orders ardently. He couldn't cope with imperfections \\u2014 a leaf on his driveway, a smear on his shining shoes. Life, to him, was a most deliberate business. You can dredge in his childhood for the reasons. His father went mad, and was confined to an asylum; maybe that was the disorder Hoover feared. Or it may have been the sweet tyranny of his mother's childhood rules, never quite outgrown, which he tried to recreate in his rigid adult life. Or it may simply have been that he was hiding: that his confused sexuality could at any time have brought him down. At all events, his paranoia had resonances for most Americans. You have to remember a nation where new immigrants were constantly adjusting the culture, the language, the sounds and smells on the street, and where new ideas \\u2014 like socialism, like anarchism or Bolshevism \\u2014 were associated with literal newcomers. \\u2018America\\u2019 seemed constantly at risk. That feeling started Hoover's grand career, in 1919. Revolution was an imminent fact. Lenin came in loud and clear. The nation had been buffeted by a wave of strikes. Someone set a bomb at the house of the US Attorney General. In this fearful atmosphere, Hoover was hired for the Department of Investigation. His job was to make a card index of suspect radicals \\u2014 anyone who wrote or talked against government. Hoover threw himself into the campaign. He presented the case for deporting Emma Goldman, feminist and anarchist, and sailed out into New York harbour to taunt her when she was loaded on a troopship bound for Russia. He made himself the centre for information during the Red Raids that followed, brutal nights when civil liberties were swept aside. On 2 January 1920, more than 10,000 people were arrested in 23 cities. Almost all of them were released without charge, much later. Their files, though, stood against them for ever. And Hoover added to those files: he investigated any lawyers who dared defend those arrested. He called Felix Frankfurter, later a Justice of the Supreme Court, \\u2018a disseminator of Bolshevik propaganda\\u2019 in a report which he later tried to disown. He had learned two valuable lessons when, in 1924, he became head of the Bureau of Investigations. Fear can break political movements; the Communist Party of America, a paper threat at best, lost 14,000 of its 20,000 members in a year. And power lies in the files, in knowing, and making sure the knowledge cannot be checked or shared. You don't even need a secret to fear being found out. TO this devil's brew, Hoover added one more twist: publicity. He'd weigh uselessly into investigations, like the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby; he accused a pigeon of being a criminal's homing pigeon, to the shock of the ordinary cops. He merchandised the invented notion of the G-Men, the \\u2018Government men\\u2019, the Feds from the FBI. His columnist chums built up the Dillingers and Machine Gun Kellys of America, the small-time hoods, and the G-Men, with some difficulty, took them out. The publicity and the facts were not always the same. Hoover kept Dillinger's gun in his office, but the serial number shows it was made after Dillinger was dead. Always, the hero of these stories was Hoover. He burnished his reputation into cultism, as a White House report complained in the Seventies. He invented the policeman as national hero, a notion which is conservative and deeply perverse; it implies the best a society can do is to resist disorder. His fame is odder still when you consider this: Hoover was chasing small-time hoods at a time when organised crime was building an empire on Prohibition and its consequences. Hoover did nothing to prevent the Mob taxing business in America, running drugs, vice and gambling. Maybe he was a man so obsessed with hidden things that he simply couldn't see open criminality \\u2014 which looked like business and politics almost as usual. Hoover, the super-cop, had to be compelled by circumstances \\u2014 the discovery of Mob bosses conferring in upstate New York in 1957 \\u2014 even to acknowledge that the Mafia exists. Within two years, he'd already tried to forget. Or maybe he knew that the Mob had files of their own, that Meyer Lansky, the one-time bootlegger and now the gambling mogul, had pictures which could ruin him: Edgar and Clyde, for once unambiguously tangled. Summers says so, but he hasn't seen the pictures, and there are always problems with stories that emphasise the power of Meyer Lansky; he became a kind of bogeyman, credited with old crimes to boost a reputation which helped people do what the Mob wanted. Besides, rumours of pictures like this abound, usually seen by rivals in intelligence services; was Meyer Lansky bad at keeping secrets, even when a secret kept the head of the FBI in his power? Hoover was certainly, Summers shows, spectacularly indifferent to those straight arrow standards he set for his agents. He gambled at a time when the Mob ran gaming, and he never expected to lose. He invested in oil companies, thanks to his buddies, and his investments were always covered; at his death, there were rumours of secret investment accounts. He hung out with the likes of Lewis Rosentiel, a booze tycoon who had invested in Lansky's casinos. And this association is the one which produces Summers's most bizarre evidence. Rosentiel's fourth wife Susan spent ten years trying to divorce him, a decade of singular bitterness, involving his perjury and attempts to jail her. She was willing to give evidence about his Mob links in 1970; today, she says he was an enthusiastic bisexual who involved J Edgar Hoover in sexual orgies just as the Kennedys were trying to make him take action against the Mob. As you judge her story, you may care to remember her considerable grievances. She says she was taken to the Plaza Hotel, to a party where Hoover sat in a fine black frock and insisted on being called \\u2018Mary\\u2019; after a while, he retired to the bedroom to be petted by two bought boys, one of whom prudently wore rubber gloves. If you wanted to invent a perfectly stereotyped queer, this is the story you'd tell \\u2014 down to the name \\u2018Mary\\u2019 and the fact that his sexual partners were young, and prostitutes. And just after the supposed orgy, as Summers admits but in an end-note, the FBI began heavy surveillance of Meyer Lansky \\u2014 supposedly the blackmailer-in-chief. But if this really was the sum of Hoover's sexuality \\u2014 sad, mean and sporadic, a slight release from the need to control himself utterly \\u2014 he seems almost pitiable. It helps explain his fixation on the details of other people's erotic lives, the keyhole stuff that filled his files, the anger \\u2014 envy, perhaps \\u2014 which made him project homosexuality onto all manner of public figures. For J Edgar Hoover, happiness was just another kind of disorder. AT first, the politicians thought they could run Hoover. At the request of FDR, Hoover opened files on anyone who opposed the president's line on national defence and tried to intimidate press critics like the Chicago Tribune. FDR allowed Hoover, an official, to by-pass Cabinet members and come directly to the president; in time, this back channel made Hoover uncontrollable. And he extended Hoover's powers. Wiretapping, technically illegal, was first authorised in 1940 (the FBI had used it, of course, before that). What Hoover could not do, as usual, was the real job. For that, he needed not just hundreds of incorruptible field agents writing down what they overheard, but also analysts able to detect when people were joking; some of the oddest accusations, like Eleanor Roosevelt's supposed affair with two lefty trades unionists, come from the agents' innocence of dirty jokes. Hoover couldn't even see the point of intelligence reports which showed Japan's interest in how to attack a deep harbour, and how deep Pearl Harbour might be. The OSS, fore-runner of the CIA, was born out of his obtuseness, and remained his bitter rival. Hoover feuded with the CIA for decades and even, in 1970, shocked Washington by breaking relations between the agencies altogether. That's a reason, incidentally, for caution on stories of photographs glimpsed at the end of dinners for OSS veterans \\u2014 the pictures of Edgar on his knees, making love to Clyde. If they exist, these pictures come from specialists in disinformation with a grudge. But for all his incompetence in wartime, Hoover was now settled in the Washington game \\u2014 privileged, sanctified, unbudgeable and with more and more information to use. He'd tell presidents about their appointees, promise appointees and Senators he'd suppressed their files, let certain papers know \\u2014 on plain paper, in plain envelopes \\u2014 what he'd overheard or snatch-shot or been told. This power, Summers says, was what brought Lyndon Johnson \\u2014 Hoover's old ally, even though he called him \\u2018that queer bastard\\u2019\\u2014 onto the ticket with John Kennedy in 1960. Hoover knew how the Mob helped Kennedy buy votes; more to the point, he knew about Kennedy's skirt-chasing. The Kennedy brothers went away to consider who'd be vice-president, and named their loudest rival, LBJ. They promised never to tell why but it was, Summers says, Hoover's blackmail. By now, Hoover was a politicians' nightmare \\u2014 perceived by some as the perfect cop, but known at close range for his rants, his sexual obsessions, his card index and his file cabinets which by now contained all the sins, real and imagined, of the political world. \\u2018He's rather a psycho,\\u2019 Robert Kennedy said, off the record, in 1964. \\u2018I think he's become senile, and rather\\u2026frightening.\\u2019 But the Kennedys needed his special protection racket \\u2014 to destroy phone company records when Marilyn Monroe committed suicide, for example, or to leak FBI reports that disproved stories suggesting John Kennedy, the good Catholic boy, was actually on his second marriage. And when Kennedy was shot, the \\u2018psycho\\u2019 Hoover botched the FBI investigation personally, ignoring evidence that there might have been more than a single gunman involved, sending agents to question the background of the Warren Commission's staff, punishing his own agents for failing to spot Oswald's violent nature. He went from briefing the new president that evidence against Oswald was too weak for a conviction to insisting that Oswald was the man. It's tempting to scent conspiracy \\u2014 did Hoover stall investigations which might lead to the Mob, who held those compromising pictures?\\u2014 but there's no need. What we have here is a senile man, desperate to be right; his story is all that holds the world together, he just knows. His whole life was his office. When Nixon threatened to take it away, Hoover, without warning or symptoms, died. Summers drops hints about murder, or suicide, but the truth may be simpler and more terrible: Hoover was not a breath more than his job. It did not take burglars and curious poisons to dispose of him. AT the funeral, the flag that draped Hoover's coffin was presented to Clyde Tolson; there was, after all, no widow. It was a curiously graceful, open moment in a history of secrets. But to all who valued Hoover, of course, it couldn't mean a damn thing. Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J Edgar Hoover by Anthony Summers, published by Gollancz, \\u00a318.99. Brave veterans can cruise through danger zone VETERANS from the perilous Second World War Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union are to have the chance to relive their historic efforts \\u2014 but without the hardship they once endured. The former seamen, who risked their lives against the elements and German U-boats to ferry vital supplies to northern Russia, can enjoy a berth on a luxury liner for the return trip. The voyages, two 11-night cruises to mark the 50th anniversary of the convoys to Murmansk and Archangel, will trace much of the old route. The heroism of the merchant seamen who manned the convoys was marked after the war when the Russians struck a special medal for them. The cruises were devised after Arctic veterans wrote to Saga magazine, published by the Folkestone-based specialist holiday company. The editor, Paul Bach, said: \\u2018The convoys left indelible memories with all who were on them. Many veterans have revisited Archangel and Murmansk in peacetime, but until now they have had to travel by air or overland. \\u2018We're recapturing something of their earlier experiences with a cruise around North Cape, skirting the Barents Sea and into the White Sea port of Archangel.\\u2019 As well as visiting the ports of Bergen, Narvik, Tromso and Honningsvag, the tour offers a strong Arctic Convoys theme with talks, videos and memorabilia on show. Plea for new helpers for \\u2018shared care\\u2019 scheme A CAMPAIGN to find people who are prepared to spend time with children and adults with learning difficulties has been begun in Strathclyde, writes Alan Forbes. The region's social work department is appealing for \\u2018shared carers\\u2019 who can spend one or two days a month with people who have special needs. The department has about 70 families and individuals acting as carers to give people chance to develop new interests and greater self-confidence and offering their families a chance to have some time to themselves. James Burns, chairman of the region's child care subcommittee, said yesterday: \\u2018Many young men, women and children with learning difficulties want to use our shared care scheme and there is tremendous potential for it to expand. It can only do that, however, if more people come forward to share their lives for a day or two each month.\\u2019 The department selects suitable carers and offers financial and practical support. Further information is available from 041-227 6044. In response to recent unbelievably horrific crimes, surely it is now time to introduce strict control on the depiction of extreme violence on films and videos. There is a clear trend for films to become increasingly violent and sadistic, with each new film trying to outdo the last in savagery. This must have a major part to play in the increasing mindless violence of young people, imitating what they have been encouraged to believe is \\u2018entertainment\\u2019, namely torture, murder and cannibalism. The greatest danger comes from videos, where it is impossible to limit the age of the viewer. What is now required is a law making it a crime to act in, produce, distribute or sell films and videos depicting cruel and excessive violence. Those responsible should be charged with incitement to commit crimes of violence. Even if only one innocent person's life is saved, it will be worthwhile. The producers of films should be aiming to bring pleasure and entertainment, not pandering to the lowest savage instinct, however profitable that may be. Respect for human life is surely worth more than easy profit. Price mystery I read (Farming, today) that farmers are being paid \\u00a310 a tonne for potatoes. The cheapest I can buy them for my dinner is \\u00a32.50 per half hundredweight bag. Where does the \\u00a390 per tonne difference go? Emotional dirge How often does it have to be demonstrated that Flower of Scotland is a good pub/folk song but is manifestly unsuitable as a national anthem? At Ibrox on Wednesday night we heard the usual rammy of an unco-ordinated band and throng (and a pipe band, I regret to say, only compounds the offence), and pretty awful it sounded on the radio. Gratitude that the Scottish Football Association and Scottish Rugby Union have apparently stopped insulting us with Scotland the Brave is not reason enough to allow them to inflict \\u2018the people's choice\\u2019 upon us. This emotional dirge, albeit popular and heartfelt, is just not the \\u2018right stuff\\u2019. Scots Wha Hae, which some may claim is another emotional dirge, has tremendous credentials (tune going back to the 14th century and words by our national bard). It only needs a slightly increased tempo to be the great national anthem our country maybe doesn't deserve, but will surely grow into when we have cast off childish things and grasped the thistle of independence. TV distortion of everyday world According to your editorial today (\\u2018Filling the vacuum\\u2019), \\u2018take all violence out of television drama and you disconnect it from reality\\u2019; whose \\u2018reality\\u2019? Television is already about as divorced from the real, everyday world as it could possibly be. Perhaps one of the reasons why we are faced with the menace of increasing savagery among a minority of the young is that they fail to realise that TV is not a \\u2018window on the world\\u2019, but a structure of small, angled, mirrors reflecting different viewpoints. I remember the editor of ITN saying at a meeting in the 1960s that he sometimes wished he could precede every bulletin with: \\u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the people in the world went about their lives today without anything unusual happening to them. This bulletin contains items about what happened to some of the other 1 per cent.\\u2019 Man's inhumanity to man makes nations interested. This is why current affairs programmes concentrate so much on doom and gloom, even away from the big stories of the day. The lives of articulate people can be more interesting than fiction, but in general they would bore viewers more than the new vogue of delving into every aspect of sexual behaviour in discussion programmes. Why are these producers so fascinated by sex? In a country where teenage rape and murder are on the increase, do we really need this salaciousness and is it responsible to show a programme which lingers over the grisly reminiscences of a psychotic serial murderer? Again, bombarding the young day by day with fictitious views of the sordid side of human life can distort their view of the world. Perhaps now that Morse, with its lack of overt sex or violence, has in recent weeks achieved the highest rating of any current programme, producers and writers may realise that delving into the same old muck no longer wins large audiences. They may realise also that to do so is perhaps a reflection of their own inability to create the excellent plot structure, characterisation and atmosphere of this successful series. Old chestnut I felt a distinct sense of deja vu when reading JR Hall's letter (12 February). Once again the hoary old chestnut of road transport not covering its track costs has been pulled out, this time in defence of BR. It seems only a few weeks ago, but is probably about a year, since I, through Points of View, had to draw attention to the Department of Transport's annual statistics bulletin, The Allocation of Road Track Costs. The current edition breaks down expected road expenditure and the tax-take from road users for the current financial year and shows, as previous editions have done, that road users cover their track costs by a factor of 2.4 to 1. In other words users of all types, from motor-cyclists to the owners of the heaviest vehicles, pay almost two and a half times as much in taxes as is spent on all road costs from building, maintenance and signs, right down to the provision of police, traffic wardens and even grass cutting and hedge-trimming of the verges. The expected figures this year are, income, \\u00a314,700 million; and expenditure, \\u00a36,030 million. Even given that these are projected figures, it would take a massive error to even get close to a break-even, never mind a situation whereby track costs were not covered. Britain's importance now lies in being part of one of the world's great trading blocs, the European Community John Major will meet Bill Clinton for the first time tomorrow. However, the \\u2018special relationship\\u2019 that marked the Reagan and Bush years has gone and there is plenty of scope for disagreement over a packed agenda. Ewen MacAskill reports Face to face and an eyeful of the opposition THERE are few guarantees in politics but it is a more than reasonable bet that John Major and Bill Clinton will both be smiling and behaving as if they are buddies when they give a press conference at the White House tomorrow afternoon. Even if they have found the previous hour of talks  excruciating , finding they have little in common on a whole host of difficult issues, they will come out smiling. There is apprehension in Downing Street and, to a lesser extent, at the White House over the first meeting between the new president and the Prime Minister. The nervousness in Downing Street is evident in the extent to which Major and his officials have been stressing since Clinton's election that the two have a potentially good relationship. Downing Street repeatedly points out the two have had friendly telephone calls. But the more Downing Street protests, the greater the suspicion that Major is jittery about US-UK relations. Major will spend tomorrow morning on Capitol Hill in discussion with party leaders and have lunch at the British Embassy with further US movers and shakers, including the head of the Central Intelligence Agency. At 3pm, he will meet Clinton and the two will be together for the next six hours, an indication that the president regards the Prime Minister's visit as more than just a courtesy call. They have a long agenda that includes the GATT trade talks and a host of foreign issues, including Iraq, Bosnia, Russia and, to British embarrassment, Northern Ireland. But British officials yesterday put at the top of the agenda the personal relationship between the two men, how the two will get on face to face. One official said that the two shared a similar background and were of a similar age and added that, knowing the Prime Minister, he was sure they would establish a rapport. The initial problem is that Major is a Conservative and Clinton is a Democrat, and although party differences are not necessarily a bar to a good relationship, the problem has been compounded by two incidents during the US election campaign. One was a visit by two Conservatives from Tory Central Office in London to give advice to the Bush campaign. The Republicans had been impressed by Major's election victory in April, felt there were useful lessons to be learned and invited two political advisers. Although the two are not regarded in London as senior Conservative strategists, their presence was resented by the Clinton camp. The other incident was when the Home Office investigated files on Clinton's time at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. This was interpreted in the Clinton camp as the Major government attempting to give Bush a hand by digging up dirt on Clinton as a Vietnam draft-dodger or pot-smoker. When Major visited Washington in December, he had expected to see Clinton. But Clinton refused to leave his home state of Arkansas and this was interpreted as a snub to Major. The Downing Street line on the Home Office incident was that it had been a junior official who had gone through the files to help answer journalists' inquiries about Clinton, not to help the Bush  Administration . As for the Conservative Central Office foray to the US, the Government remains uneasy about this. British officials, rehearsing for questions from US journalists, attempted to distance themselves. Firstly, they pointed out that as government officials, party matters were not relevant to them. More significantly, the Government yesterday made the biggest effort yet to defuse the row by saying the two Central Office officials' visit had been cleared by the Tory chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, but Major himself had known nothing about it. Clinton is said not to be seeking revenge, but others in his  Administration are bitter. A source at the US Embassy in London dismissed the whole affair as one that has got out of proportion and a diversion from a packed agenda. Even if the Conservative involvement in the US election campaign is pushed into the background, there is plenty of scope on the agenda for disagreement, not least Northern Ireland. Clinton wooed the Irish vote in his campaign by promising to send a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, a move regarded by Britain as an intrusion into a domestic issue. Since the election, officials on both sides of the Atlantic have toned this down to a special envoy, one that would be on a fact-finding mission. Although Britain still regards this as an embarrassment, it is putting a brave face on it by claiming that most Irish-Americans have a distorted, nationalistic view of the conflict and that such a mission might go part of the way to dispelling it. On his visit to Capitol Hill, Major will meet Tom Foley, the House of Representatives' Speaker, an Irish-American who has been mentioned as leading such a mission. The reaction from Ulster Unionists has been an almost automatic rejection, but Downing Street has been keen to point out that Foley has been vocal in his criticism of the IRA and his appointment might not be such a bad move. In the bigger world, the GATT talks seem to have been going on forever, with Downing Street promising for two years that the end was in sight. The fear must be that Clinton might unpick some of the deals, such as the one on agriculture, but this was thought to be unlikely, given his commitment to moving out of recession. On the strategic front, there has been no coherent approach since President Bush dubbed the post-Cold War position as the New World Order. In fact, western policy has been notable for its lack of order, particularly towards Russia. On Bosnia, while Britain has welcomed US involvement, it has had to keep itself from dismissing as laughable the feasibility of proposed US airdrops. The \\u2018special relationship\\u2019 has long been a myth, one which the UK has more of an interest in perpetuating than the US, where the reality is that Britain is regarded as a second-rank nation. Major may have made it to the White House before Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, but that does not mean he is regarded as being more important than either of them. Talk of a \\u2018special relationship\\u2019 is a useful slogan, implying two countries that are close because of language and historical background. In the world of trade and realpolitik, it counts for nothing. Britain's importance now lies in being part of one of the world's great trading blocs, the European Community, not as the ever-dependable ally of the Reagan and Bush years. One to one: there is apprehension in Downing Street and, to a lesser extent, at the White House over the first meeting Hard times in Dundee SEVEN years on, the bleak imagery of Wapping, that archetypal 1980s dispute, looks to be returning to haunt the nineties. A workforce, on strike over lay-offs, is offered a return-to-work package which includes significant changes in conditions, among them a wage freeze. It says it can accept these only under protest, a response apparently regarded as ungracious. All 300, including a handful who had refused to strike, are dismissed. Almost immediately, the company advertises for replacement labour. Hunched figures, heads hidden by anorak hoods or bin-liners, start to be bussed through the security fences, safe from the muffled cries of the pickets at the gates. Just to make sure the strikers get the message, court proceedings are begun against the shop stewards for allegedly allowing picket numbers to swell above six. At the gates, frustration turns on the police, once again called on to enforce an industrial relations strategy. These are the economics, not of efficiency, but of attrition. They have much less to do with the demands of competitiveness than with the perversities of an industrial relations law whose imbalance was over-corrected during the 1980s. The actions of Timex in Dundee exude an air of pre-meditation rather reminiscent of Rupert Murdoch's at Wapping: even down to the fortified perimeter installed by the new management team after it took over 18 months ago. A strike over one issue suddenly becomes a whole different battleground. Management talks about \\u2018securing the business,\\u2019 strike leaders about a calculated attempt to smash the unions. Management can argue that the plant has been losing money: the unions can point to their (not always peaceable) acceptance of previous cost-cutting, which has reduced manning to just a few hundred from the thousands once employed there. Following closely on the radical reforms which Hoover workers at Cambuslang were pressed into accepting, the cheerless events now unfolding at Timex are unlikely to improve the reputation in Scotland of multinational employers. That is less than just, since many overseas-owned firms are fair and decent employers, just as some British companies are not. The real blame lies with the licence granted to employers by a statutory regime which stacks every deck in their favour. Still, a Government lately inclined to talk nostalgically about communities might well reflect on whether the actions of a Timex could be said to mesh well with the interests or values of a community which has long afforded the company a secure base and a loyal workforce. Sadly, it is far from clear where, if anywhere, industrial workforces fit in Mr Major's sepia notions of community. His determination to deny them the \\u2018improved living and working conditions, proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour\\u2019 aspired to by the Maastricht social chapter suggest he may have had a different community in mind from the sort outside the gates of Timex. Are you being served? Not very often KAY BLAIR was recently shocked to find herself the recipient of high quality service WHY is it that whenever I decide to don salopettes and head off in search of that damned elusive substance \\u2014 Scottish snow \\u2014 howling hurricanes decide to renew my acquaintance and pea-soupers that would have done Victorian London proud descend on the mountain? This was Aonach Mor, Scotland's otherwise impressive new skiing facility based just north of Fort William. The weather was ghastly. The skiing conditions little better, with snow as soft as sand. But through the murk there was a faint glimmer of light. Throughout the day those working the lifts and keeping an eye on skiers actually \\u2014 wait for it \\u2014 smiled. They helped load skis into gondolas. They made sure children got safely on to the chairlift and picked them up and dusted them down if they fell. They produced rather more appetising food than the normal congealed heap of pie and beans and dead sausage rolls which it is mandatory to decline at other resorts. They even, praise be, asked skiers at the end of the day whether they had enjoyed the experience, hopefully so that they could take positive action if they had any complaints or worthwhile suggestions. Could this at last be a Scottish leisure facility which was trying to put customer care into practice? Not being a frequent visitor to the area I have no way of knowing whether this was a freak occurrence. I hope not, because it actually felt as if this new resort was intent on getting to know its customers and providing them with a level of service in tune with expectations. It doesn't happen often. Given the sorry demise of Scotland's manufacturing base, we are all, if the good Baroness Thatcher's doctrine is believed, supposed to be imbued with a service culture which recognises the value of the customer and produces the kind of quality response required. But, to quote one of Maggie's very own good and faithful servants: \\u2018Bunkum and Balderdash.\\u2019 We know the jargon. We spout quality verbiage. Corporate luminaries cackle on about the importance of quality, yet all too often use this management-babble as a substitute for effective leadership. We pin up quality ditties on corporate walls to enthuse staff of our good and noble intentions. We claim to produce quality this, serve quality that. We witter on about quality initiatives and produce myriads of little forms to show just how quality-driven we are. But how many have actually analysed just what quality is. How many truly realise that quality is knowing your buyer, getting him or her to define quality, rather than producing some sort of static standard which demands slavish conformance? And, more to the point, how many organisations have managed to convert their good \\u2018quality\\u2019 intentions into effective staff training which ensures that customers are treated with respect? The sad fact is that many organisations would be unable to recognise a customer even if he or she fell in front of them. According to a recent report from the market research company Mintel, customer perceptions of quality in products and service have more to do with their expectation that companies should get it right first time than with the belief that they should provide a safety net to protect consumers once things have gone wrong. Consumers, says Mintel, regard quality as the totality of attributes of the product or service which combines to meet their needs and expectations. And, when it comes to services, consumers are quite unanimous that quality is mostly down to the staff and how they behave with customers. \\u2018Consumers do not confuse the availability of good physical facilities with good quality; such facilities may tempt a consumer to choose a particular shop, but it is the quality of the staff which will determine whether the consumer will buy or return a second time.\\u2019 But, if the truth be told, although we would like companies to get it right first time, our experiences have led us to expect rather less. We don't believe that British goods will be as good as foreign imports. We allow ourselves to be served by surly shop assistants \\u2014 and we don't complain. Like stooges, we accept in silence. Step out of line, demand better attention, and you meet tight-lipped disapproval. Fellow sufferers move uncomfortably away rather than face similar embarrassment. Aonach Mor may be a step ahead of the game because it is a new skiing resort with attitudes untainted by years of traditional working practices. But, in spite of such typically awful Scottish weather conditions, I would go back, greenhouse effect permitting. And that, surely, is what business is all about. Resourceful woman of powerful persuasion WHATEVER the good intentions and fine words about women doing anything a man can do, there are still industries where men would be surprised to find themselves dealing with a woman. Grace Buckley, Scottish-Power's most senior woman executive, doesn't let it worry her. As fuel and by-products manager, she is responsible for buying all the fuel the electricity giant uses \\u2014 coal, oil, gas or even slurry \\u2014 and selling the by-products of electricity, such as ash. Her opposite numbers are almost all men. \\u2018If there are any advantages it comes from the background. The reaction from the other side of the table is different because you are a woman, they expect you to do it a different way.\\u2019 Buckley probably does do it differently, working towards less confrontation and for a solution that will last. \\u2018That doesn't mean they will get an easier deal,\\u2019 she laughs. The bruised executives of British Coal would testify to that after their run-in over the coal contract which ended up in court. Buckley is unrepentant, arguing that what remains of the Scottish coal industry now has a more secure future. \\u2018Somebody had to take a stand. We were expected to put our hands in our pockets and shell out regardless of whether or not we were getting value for money. Perhaps we were seen as abrasive because we had the courage to say what everyone else was thinking.\\u2019 Buckley has been in this job since 1988 and in the department since 1981, but she started as a lawyer in private practice, a profession where equality is far more of a reality than in industry. She joined the old South of Scotland Electricity Board in 1976 as a legal assistant \\u2014 the first female solicitor it had employed \\u2014 but by 1980 wanted to do something different and went back to university with the company's blessing (and a scholarship) to get an MBA. When she came back she was put into contracts and purchasing in the knowledge that she was a potential candidate for management  succession , although no promises were made. \\u2018I was the right person in the right place at the right time.\\u2019 Buckley says she has never been aware of a problem of discrimination in the company, at least in a corporate sense, \\u2018but I think a lot of men found it a problem\\u2019. \\u2018When I first started going to open-cast sites I was unusual and it was pretty well guaranteed to stop operations in their tracks.\\u2019 Going first meant that Buckley did not have any role models or even mentors. \\u2018I just look at whoever is in the job ahead. It is a question of whether they are good at managing. If they are you use them as a role model.\\u2019 She knows that by virtue of her position many women see her as a role model and so is happy to give advice when asked for it. Any problems she has encountered have not been because of her gender, but because she has had older people working for her. \\u2018What happens when women engineers come through may be a different matter. They are dealing with power station staff and other engineers who don't make any allowances for you. If you get sat on it is because you allow yourself to be sat on. It is not because you are female.\\u2019 In any case she thinks it is just a matter of time before more women start coming through to senior levels, both because the company is taking on more female graduates and because they are a pretty self-confident lot anyway. \\u2018One of the women who works for me is one of the toughest women I have ever come across, and most of the women graduates are more than competent. There are a lot of good young women coming up.\\u2019 WHERE difficulties can occur is in the matter of families. Buckley, who is unmarried, admits that being successful in business is easier for a woman who has no children. It is still assumed that it is the woman who will give up work to look after the children or take time off if they are sick, she admits. \\u2018If you are going to be in senior job you are going to put a lot of time in so you give up your social life a bit perhaps. You feel pressure not to be seen to fail in the job. You have got to show you are at least as good and a little bit extra to cover your back.\\u2019 Like many women who have crashed through the glass ceiling \\u2014 or, perhaps, ignored it \\u2014 she is strongly opposed to positive discrimination in favour of women and has little time for the argument that women don't succeed because they are women. \\u2018It is almost certainly the case you have to do a little bit extra because you are female but you don't have to prove you are twice as good.\\u2019 But how will we know when the glass ceiling has gone. \\u2018I suppose equality will come when you no longer notice whether it is a man or a woman across the table.\\u2019 Buyer of all she surveys: Grace Buckley finds coal comfort No skirting the issue of inequality on high Why is the fairer sex so unfairly represented in the top echelons? PETER WOODIFIELD reports on the assault on the invisible barriers and speaks to one woman who has bypassed them CHANGING attitudes to women in business is like changing course in a giant tanker. Everything happens slowly but eventually change becomes apparent as more business leaders realise the nonsense of wasting the talents of a large chunk of their workforce. The problem has been particularly acute in the top echelons where the blue and grey suits are rarely disturbed by a skirt. Just 0.5 per cent of Britain's company directors are women. In 1991 the Government launched Opportunity 2000 in an attempt to encourage industry and commerce to take the issue seriously and the past two years have seen two of Britain's top 15 companies \\u2014 BTR and Sainsbury \\u2014 appoint female finance directors. But the focus on women at the top has tended to focus on entrepreneurs such as Anita Roddick and Scotland's Pat Grant and Ann Gloag. At least that way there is no way you can be held back by the so-called \\u2018glass ceiling\\u2019\\u2014 the phrase coined in the United States to describe the invisible barriers that allow women to rise only so far in an organisation. On 9 March the Scottish division of the Institute of Directors, with Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise and supported by The Scotsman, is holding a seminar in Edinburgh to discuss the issue, covering not just the boardroom but also senior levels of management. The IoD's Scottish membership, 68 women of 1,640 members, underlines the point. Donald Hardie, the Scottish director of the IoD, feels the problem stems from the education system, with girls being discouraged from studying the subjects that would get them on to the business ladder. \\u2018The problem is that they are not there to be promoted.\\u2019 That is by and large true, but Hardie is not certain that men have taken it on board and he is keen for plenty of men to attend to get a better understanding of the position. But while there may a shortage of suitable female candidates, it also becoming clear that there are women who have made it precisely because they refuse to be deflected from their chosen career. Indeed, one of the speakers at the IoD seminar is Lesley Bale, the managing director of Aberdeen Airport at the tender age of 33. For her and others like her it is a question of wanting it sufficiently, being prepared to put in the work and not expecting concessions because they are women. The glass ceiling does not exist because they don't let it. But not all women are like that. Too many allow themselves to be steered into what are seen as traditionally female jobs, or suffer discrimination if and when they have children. Women also tend to have a different, more consensual style of management, and often dislike playing by the corporate rules that are invariably laid down by men. Douglas Kinnaird, of PA Consultants and one of the UK's top headhunters, makes the point that quite often women don't realise how hard promotion is to get and that men have worked for it for months, if not years. \\u2018If they want to get promoted they have got to fight tooth and nail. They have got to find out the rules and then fight by the rules.\\u2019 A failure to realise just how tough it is means such women are held back more by their own glass hat than any supposed glass ceiling. One reality that cannot be avoided in the whole discussion is children. There is still an unspoken assumption that it will be the women who make the sacrifices when it comes to childcare and it is perhaps the thickest glass ceiling of all for many women. Government statistics show that 74 per cent of women in managerial and administrative positions have no children, and that is hardly likely to be a coincidence. As it is, women hold barely more than a quarter of all managerial and administrative posts, yet make up nearly half the workforce. In the longer term, that particular barrier is likely to disappear through sheer economic necessity on the part of business. Graduate recruitment in many businesses and industries now tends to be evenly split, and companies will not be able to afford to lose a large chunk of talent in which so much money has been invested, especially as women in any case tend to be less tempted by the \\u2018grass is greener\\u2019 syndrome. But all that being said, there is a real problem right now. Kinnaird, who is chairing the seminar, says he is regularly asked to find a woman for a senior management job \\u2018all other things being equal\\u2019. The trouble is that things are not equal, and he can hardly remember placing a woman in such a job. A headhunter for ten years, Kinnaird has just been commissioned by his first female client, which speaks volumes. It is hardly surprising that he cannot find the people he is looking for when even the largest organisations have so few senior women. The Royal Bank of Scotland has a record in this field to be proud of, being a founder member of Opportunity 2000 and also one of just 150 companies entitled to call themselves Investors in People. It has also just won its second national training award. Now 30 per cent of its junior management are women, although that figure falls away to a paltry 1 per cent at the highest levels. The Royal has committed itself to increase that significantly in the next few years. Dr Mike Mosson, director personnel at the Royal Bank, says the bank has a policy of \\u2018positive assistance\\u2019 and \\u2018positive encouragement\\u2019towards women, although he insists that it falls short of positive discrimination. For some time it has had career breaks to help women (and occasionally men) with family needs and he says it has been successful. But while corporately the bank has adopted a positive approach, Mosson admits this is not always reflected in individual behaviour. He admits to being surprised at the split attitudes of middle-aged men \\u2014 and even some of the younger ones \\u2014 who want their daughters to have a proper career structure but then fail to apply that belief at work. \\u2018We are winning in the sense we are finding it easier for women to make progress in the organisation and they are not the exception any more. I don't think we are moving fast enough, but being realistic we are winning.\\u2019 Most organisations are not so far advanced. Perhaps more typical is Scottish & Newcastle, which has a high proportion of female workers. Henry Fairweather, group personnel and services director, acknowledges that most of its female managers are in areas one might expect such as marketing, information services and personnel. \\u2018We have some in more traditional areas such as production but not as senior as we would like.\\u2019 S&N's executive committee has recently approved an initiative to find out what the situation is and is preparing an attitude survey to identify what managers are really thinking and what the problems are perceived to be. At the moment, less than 10 per cent of S&N's senior managers are women, but none of them are directors of any of the subsidiaries, let alone of the main board. Like the Royal Bank it is not setting specific targets. \\u2018At the end of the day it comes down to individual decisions about individual jobs,\\u2019 says Fairweather. \\u2018What we have to do is create a culture in which appointing women to senior jobs is easier,\\u2019 he says. That may not be as difficult as S&N or anyone else fears given that women's more consensus-based approach to management is increasingly seen to be an appropriate style of management. \\u2018By encouraging people to manage in a certain way you make it seem more appropriate to appoint women.\\u2019 That may seem a softly-softly approach, but by making aspiring women managers and executives feel more comfortable with the management culture, it could prove effective in shattering the glass ceiling. The sky falls in on American parent THE parent company of American Airlines lost a lot of money last year, a record even before accounting rule changes drove the amount to $935 million (\\u00a3635 million). But AMR's balance sheet is strong, its fleet young and passenger traffic has been climbing in recent months. So, when the company hosted 70 reporters for an annual review of business last week, few expected chief executive Robert Crandall to say the sky was falling. But he did. \\u2018We are not going to be in business long term,\\u2019 Mr Crandall said at a dinner with the reporters. \\u2018At the labour costs we incur today, we cannot be in business long term.\\u2019 He was not predicting the end of American, the nation's largest airline, but Mr Crandall said changing economics may eventually force AMR to sell parts of American to people who can make it profitable. Similarly gloomy comments by another AMR executive in a recent Wall Street Journal article prompted hundreds of travellers to call American about the soundness of their tickets. Some worried employees even called news organisations in Dallas and Fort Worth to find out what was happening at the company. The comments come as American negotiates a new contract with the union representing its 21,600 flight attendants. But Mr Crandall said the company will not seek concessions because that would hurt employee morale, which he said must be maintained in a service business. For months, American executives have been reviewing all aspects of the airline for cost savings. The airline cut 600 managerial jobs in December. American will not renew any expiring leases on Boeing 727s, a move that could affect as many as 65 short-haul jets. And executives say they will decide by the end of March whether to ground up to 25 DC-10s or stop leasing a similar number of Airbus A300s. Removing the wide-body aircraft will force American to cut some routes and possibly some hubs by summer, reversing nearly a decade of growth. A delegation of North Carolina political and business officials, led by Governor Jim Hunt, will visit Mr Crandall later this week to offer the airline a $620,000 (\\u00a342,000) incentive package to keep open its hub in Raleigh-Durham. \\u2018I am not sure there is anything a state can do to change the economics of the airline business,\\u2019 Mr Crandall said. \\u2014 PA Mr Crandall has repeatedly blamed competitors operating in bankruptcy for keeping air fares low since they have fewer costs to recover. He said bankruptcy laws should allow a company just a year to restructure debts or get out of business. \\u2014 AP Big Apple buffs itself up for Japan New York's mayor has travelled to Tokyo to ensure that Japan's cash-conscious companies don't abandon the city that never sleeps. DAVID THURBER reports THE mayor of New York, David Dinkins, yesterday urged Japanese companies \\u2014 who are cutting spending on foreign investment \\u2014 not to abandon New York. Mr Dinkins expressed an envy of Tokyo's cleanliness and low crime rate, but said conditions in his city were improving and urged Japanese companies not to pull out their investments. Many Japanese companies face cash shortages because of plunging profits during Japan's recession, the worst in nearly 20 years. Some have cut back on foreign investment. \\u2018It is our hope that they will not withdraw, and if anything will go the other way,\\u2019 and invest more, Mr Dinkins said. Japanese companies already account for nearly a quarter of the 5,000 foreign-based companies operating in New York. Mr Dinkins, who arrived on the weekend for his first trip to Japan, is leading a delegation of New York business executives and city officials on a week-long visit to buttress business and cultural ties. At a joint news conference yesterday with Tokyo's governor, Shunichi Suzuki, he turned quickly to some of the many differences between the sister cities, and omitted a line from a prepared statement that had said \\u2018Tokyo and New York are more alike than any two cities on the face of the earth.\\u2019 Mr Dinkins said he wished \\u2018that we could do as well as Tokyo does\\u2019 in keeping crime low and hoped to learn how Tokyo has largely avoided New York's problems of high crime, drugs and unemployment. But he stressed that crime was beginning to decline in his city. \\u2018We are familiar with stories of visitors from Japan and other Asian countries being mistreated,\\u2019 Mr Dinkins said. \\u2018We will not tolerate that.\\u2019 Mr Dinkins and Mr Suzuki signed an agreement on new sports and cultural exchanges between the two sister cities. The New York mayor also met Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, and other officials, and was to begin several days of talks with business leaders today. He devoted Sunday to sightseeing, including a ride on Tokyo's subway, a trip to Asakusa Temple and a tea ceremony at Takashimaya Department Store, which is to open a branch on New York's 5th Avenue this spring. Mr Dinkins was asked if he would follow the example of his predecessor, former Mayor Ed Koch, who planned a dip in a Japanese-style bath together with staff members during a Japan visit. \\u2018Although much of what he did I applaud, not everything that my predecessor did will I emulate,\\u2019 Mr Dinkins replied. Private companies are paying for Mr Dinkin's $650,000 ($448,000) trip. \\u2014 AP  New York, New York: Japanese companies already account for nearly a quarter of the 5,000 foreign-based companies operating in the city Belarus makes each-way bet on race to capitalism One former Soviet republic is hoping for market reform, minus the Russian example of \\u2018shock therapy\\u2019. ALEXANDER TKACHENKO reports THE former Soviet republic of Belarus is hedging its bets on economic reform with a mixture of market moves and old-style administrative measures that makes Western analysts sceptical. Government officials say they aim to reform the economy gradually while shielding the country's ten million people from the pain of full-blooded \\u2018shock therapy\\u2019 as attempted in Russia and elsewhere. \\u2018We live in a period of transition to the market. Shock methods can provoke instability in society, that is why we will continue to correct reforms in the interests of the majority of the population,\\u2019 said first deputy prime minister Mikhail Myasnikovich. The government's approach is reflected in a 1993 budget allocating 60 per cent of expenditure to social welfare and 20 per cent to farm subsidies. State orders, the pillar of the old communist system, will vary between different industries from 19 per cent to 53 per cent of production. More than half of all prices will be regulated. But Western analysts are wondering out loud whether such an approach can work. \\u2018The Belarus economy is heading for a shock this year. People in government are unwilling to understand clear, simple things,\\u2019 said one economist in the capital Minsk. Belarus, formerly Byelorussia, was the fourth most powerful republic of the Soviet Union and accounted for 5 per cent of national income; 40 per cent of the economy worked in the defence sector, and the republic also specialised in meat production and machine building. Politically conservative, Belarus earlier this month lifted a ban imposed on the Communist Party following the failed Kremlin coup of August 1991. Most of the population is Russian-speaking and Russia is the country's closest economic partner. Belarus has persuaded Moscow to sell it 16 million tonnes of oil this year \\u2014 almost as much as the 20 million tonnes Russia will supply to Ukraine, whose economy and energy needs are much bigger. But rises in the price of that Russian oil forced Belarussian inflation up to 45 per cent for the month of December, prompting the national bank to double its key interest rate in January to 30 per cent. Production over 1992 fell by 9 per cent, compared with a slump of about 20 per cent in Russia. The budget deficit was a moderate 4.3 per cent, helping to make Belarus's economic performance one of the best in the former Soviet Union. Officials maintain that living standards here are higher than elsewhere in the former superpower, but rationing exists for cereals, sugar, butter, flour, petrol and other basic goods. \\u2018This is a result of strict government efforts. We didn't lose hold of the management of the economy as happened in other republics,\\u2019 said Viktor Alampiev, head of parliament's economic reforms commission. \\u2018Businessmen are also-rans in Belarus,\\u2019 said Alexander Potupa, director of a private publishing company. He said new businesses were fleeing Belarus to other countries because of its taxes of 22 per cent on profits and 28 per cent VAT. The prime minister, Vyacheslav Kebich, defends the government's evolutionary approach to the market economy. \\u2018Our people don't like to make unreasoned decisions,\\u2019 he said recently. Mr Myasnikovich said the government aimed to carry out price liberalisation, privatisation and structural transformation of the economy to reduce dependence on Russian oil. \\u2018Belarus will continue to move resolutely to market reforms,\\u2019 he said. The deputy premier said there was no way back to the former Soviet Union. \\u2018But the whole world seeks integration and we also want it, first of all with Russia.\\u2019 Western economists, however, fear that populist government decisions, an uncontrolled money supply and the continuing rise in prices for Russian raw materials could prove a recipe for hyperinflation and the collapse of the Belarus economy. \\u2018The Belarussian government does not want to take responsibility for the results of market reforms. Government attempts to avoid social tension will bring society to hyperinflation and slow economic reforms,\\u2019 three German economic institutes concluded in a recent survey. \\u2018There are no grounds to say that Belarus will move to market reforms.\\u2019 Russian relationship: Moscow, once an overlord, is now a valued market partner for the republic of Belarus Two academics who helped parents find a cure for their dying son will relive the extraordinary story tonight Celebrating a triumph of heart over mind By John Smith TWO scientists from Stirling University expect to shed a few tears at tonight's United Kingdom premiere of a Hollywood film that tells the extraordinary story of Augusto and Michaela Odone's love for their son Lorenzo. One of them, Prof John Sargent, was among a band of eminent researchers in Britain, the United States, Canada, Italy and France who were bullied, cajoled and encouraged by the Odones to help in producing treatment that would save their son's life. Lorenzo's Oil, starring Nick Nolte, Susan Sarandon and Peter Ustinov, is a moving account of how the couple came up with the theory that a specialised oil could be used to treat their son's condition, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)\\u2014 and how they achieved unprecedented international scientific co-operation to ensure it was perfected and produced. The rare genetic disorder strikes apparently healthy boys between the ages of five and 12 when myelin, the fatty insulating sheath that surrounds nerve fibres, begins to disintegrate. The Odones were left stunned when they were told in 1984 at the Children's Hospital in Washington DC that their fun-loving, brilliant six-year-old son \\u2014 he already spoke three languages \\u2014 had ALD, and was under sentence of death. Augusto asked a doctor if there were papers they could read, and was told: \\u2018Oh, I wouldn't bother. You wouldn't be able to understand it anyway.\\u2019 From then on Augusto, at the time an economist with the World Bank, and Michaela \\u2014 neither with a scrap of medical or scientific knowledge \\u2014 read all the papers they could find on the disease, and research into its treatment. After coming up with the idea of the specialised oil, Augusto Odone contacted a dozen scientists around the world working on myelin repair. Two years ago, before he received an honorary doctorate at Stirling University, he told The Scotsman that the researchers had not been speaking to each other. \\u2018I told them to stop competing. Now they are exchanging information right away, and not waiting till it is published two years later in a scientific journal.\\u2019 Now the Odones have raised more than $1 million for the Myelin Project, directed by Augusto from Washington DC. Prof Sargent, head of the school of natural sciences at Stirling, said yesterday the Odones had defied much  scepticism from medical and scientific experts and had beaten seemingly impossible odds to find a treatment which had kept Lorenzo alive. Prof Sargent said that for the past five years, Croda Universal \\u2014 the British company which has produced the oil \\u2014 had funded research on ALD at the university. It had been carried out by himself, Dr Peter Brophy, and Dr Robert Wilson, who was also going to the premiere. Work at Stirling, he said, had led directly to the development of a new and improved Lorenzo's Oil, Mark II. He added that Croda-funded research at Stirling was now targeted towards developing a further \\u2018Lorenzo's Oil\\u2019 which it was hoped could be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In MS, a disease of the central nervous system, the insulating sheath which surrounds the nerve fibres is stripped away, much as in ALD. Heroes: Augusto Odone, who refused to accept there was no cure for his son, and Nick Nolte, who plays him in the film Screen drama: Michaela Odone, played by Susan Sarandon, nurses her son Lorenzo, Zack O'Malley Greenburgh, in a moving scene from Lorenzo's Oil Prof John Sargent: helped pioneer treatment Support for return of death penalty for wide range of serious crimes Rapidly escalating violent crime figures are an indictment of British society. They are also a reflection on those who administer \\u2018justice\\u2019 in our courts and on the legislation that gives guidelines with regard to punishment for various crimes. Without question, many judges and sheriffs are far too lenient in sentencing people found guilty of violent crimes. The soft option of imprisonment is not the answer! Millions of British people support a call for the death penalty for a wide range of offences which, in my opinion, should include the following: Murder, attempted murder, culpable homicide, rape, child abuse, possession of a deadly weapon with intent to use it, assault which results in permanent serious injury to body or mind, kidnapping, acts of terrorism and drugs' trafficking. We have reached the stage where no-one is safe to walk our streets at any time of day or night. This is an intolerable situation and society has to remove those who will not conform to reasonable standards of behaviour. The argument that a small number of innocent people may be wrongly executed is far outweighed by the fact that thousands of innocent people are dying, being permanently maimed, or mentally scarred for life, as a result of acts of violence. Moreover, millions of people live in constant fear of being attacked in the streets and in their homes! Your editorial, \\u2018Filling the vacuum\\u2019(17 February), thoughtfully discussed the interconnections between increasing violence and changing social values. Social values are difficult to define in a changing, pluralistic, capitalistic society like ours. It is more to the point to examine social practices. Politicians are wary of doing this, of course, because it forces them to accept their proper share of responsibility for the present state of anomie. The keys to a less violent society are good child-rearing; good education and good employment. Responsibilities must be shared, therefore, between parents, teachers and the Government. The founder of the National Children's Bureau, Dr Mia Kellmer-Pringle, summarised the needs of children as love/security; praise/recognition; and widening experiences; widening responsibilities. These needs remain with us, in extending forms, throughout our lives; they are basic to our self-esteem and our competence. Meeting these needs produces mature individuals. Only mature individuals can produce a mature society. The moral vacuum cannot be filled by preaching, exhortation and moralisations. It will require better parenting, better schools and far better social and economic policies. Sacred principle The Government, in threatening to ignore the will of Parliament in regard to the Maastricht treaty, is also threatening to break one of its professedly sacred principles, namely the sovereignty of Parliament. I cannot think it is serious. In the past, if a government lost a vote in Parliament over a major policy issue like the Maastricht treaty, it automatically resigned and  called a general election. Not any more, it seems. I am sure that many must, like myself, have the feeling that the small democratic element which still exists within the governmental and constitutional framework of this country is being cast aside in favour of what I can only call a self-perpetuating oligarchy. May God forgive us our hypocrisy! Global warming In describing a proposed combined heat and power scheme, Auslan Cramb claims in a report today that carbon dioxide emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect (as if this was something to be avoided). Carbon dioxide is certainly a greenhouse gas, but 99 per cent of the greenhouse effect (without which life on Earth would not be possible) is due to water vapour. The remaining 1 per cent is due to methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, CFCs, and\\u2026carbon dioxide. Perhaps Auslan Cramb meant to claim (as he has done before) that carbon dioxide emissions from combustion are causing global warming (a slight increase in the greenhouse effect raising the temperature of the Earth). However, it has not yet been established that global warming is due to excessive combustion of fossil fuels. It might be a natural fluctuation in the Earth's temperature, or even the result of the growth of the human and animal population. Consequently, carbon dioxide emissions are not necessarily something to be avoided. Skye bridge and islanders' rights I was intrigued to note that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, in his recent address to the Edinburgh University Politics Society, should choose to cite the Skye bridge development as an example of the great success of this Government's \\u2018non-interventionist\\u2019 approach to the future provision of essential public amenities. It is not without considerable irony that he should choose an example which is so uniquely interventionist as to render his previous assertion almost meaningless. This development, currently under construction, is an example of this Government's total disregard for the process of democracy and its equal contempt for the attendant principle of genuine accountability. Far from being \\u2018non-interventionist\\u2019, in this case Mr Lang has not only acted as promoter of the scheme itself, but also as overseer of the setting up of the public inquiry. Its reporter's attempts to implement even the most modest of safeguards for the people affected by the proposals, were simply dismissed by the Scottish Secretary, this time wearing the \\u2018non-interventionist\\u2019 hat of adjudicator on the inquiry's finding and recommendations. Indeed, the only non-interventionist element in all these proceedings has been the Scottish Secretary's refusal to intervene to protect the rights of the people of these communities who must have the right, if it is their wish, to have a bridge built as an integral part in the overall development of an infrastructure serving the needs of the area. This basic right has been denied to the people in a high-handed and cynical fashion. Instead, they are to be shackled indefinitely to the burden of paying high toll charges which would not be tolerated in any other part of the country. This is not simply for the purpose of recouping capital costs, but more importantly for the purpose of generating huge profits for the private sector developers. The Scottish Secretary has chosen to pursue this \\u2018non-interventionist\\u2019 policy in the face of criticism, not only from the local communities, but from the National Trust for Scotland, the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland and the many other professional commentators who have expressed their opposition on a variety of grounds. He has permitted this development, which if not in actual breach of European environmental law, is certainly at odds with its spirit. He is supporting a scheme that is essentially a monopoly and does not allow for any genuine competitive challenge which, as we have all been informed, is the only real moderating influence on the free market provision. The actions of the Government in this matter have been quite remarkable, not least in the degree of arrogance on display, but more distressingly as a result of a public rendered powerless by a Scottish Office unwilling to listen to its demands. The crazy leader of the menopausal male pack AT first you don't really believe you can do it. You have the Haynes manual, you have the socket set, the spanners, the mole wrench, the hatchet and the sledgehammer. You have the two hands of five fingers each, honed and hardened by years of typewriter and keyboard pounding. But replacing the front wheel of a motorbike? Are you kidding? I was brought up to be mechanical, to make and repair things. My father, brilliant at stripping cars and putting them back together, encouraged my interest in dismantling bicycles, old radios, antique clocks. For me, though, the pleasure and amazement was in seeing how many bits you could get out of those once-neatly-assembled packages. Then I got bored. The bits would never fit properly. A large hammer would be employed. And that was usually that. My attempt to make a bicycle chain run more smoothly on an expensive light alloy racing crank by hitting the pedals with a large axe probably summed up my adolescent mechanical bent best. But as I get older patience, a commodity not particularly noticeable in the past, has gradually appeared in my personality, like a sandbank silted into place by too many frothing tides. I have constructed a kitchen out of flatpacks with only one minor nervous breakdown and one remarkable shouting match involving my wife, her mother, myself and how a length of pine beading ought to be attached to several wall cupboards. (They were right, and this is the first time I've admitted it.) But I still wouldn't have attempted sorting the motorbike if a garage hadn't nearly killed me. This is what happened. The Orange Beast, recalcitrant hero/heroine (politically correct transsexual eastern European motorcycle and sidecar) of (cue shameless plug) book and soon-to-be-TV-series Spirit of Adventure had survived 2,000 miles of distillery-hopping with nothing more, it appeared, than a seized steering bearing and intermittent front brake failure. To the garage the beast and I unsafely struggled, a place straight out of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: Bad Karma Department. MZ250s are not glamorous bikes. They are remarkably functional workhorses, two stroke, solid and very ugly. The mechanic was not impressed. It may have been the way the exhaust pipe stained his boiler suit. Or perhaps he was anti-German for some deep-rooted racial or sexual reason. Or anti-communist, my bike hailing from pre-reunification DDR days. The steering was fixed. The brakes, I was informed, had just needed adjusting. As I rode away, I noticed that the front disc brake still faded erratically. And the rev counter no longer worked. Up the A9 towards home I rattled, reaching the scary speed of 60mph. I turned off towards Munlochy, and near the Clootie Well, the entire front hub disintegrated in a shower of hot, broken alloy, and the bike headed straight for the hedge. We survived. I had been doing about 15mph when this traumatic event occurred. The brake problems had been caused by the front wheel bearings having mostly ceased to exist, sending the whole brake assembly in and out of alignment. The garage hadn't noticed. I was determined no-one but myself would fix the beast, given what had happened. The trusty Haynes manual, a completely eccentric MZ parts specialist in London (\\u2018I got black mudguards and chrome mudguards. The black's \\u00a340 and the chrome's \\u00a360. But I'll give you the chrome for \\u00a325 'cause I got a lot of them. Or the black for \\u00a330\\u2026where is it you live, mate? Black Oil?\\u2019), the socket set and a large hammer, and to my astonishment I had fitted a new wheel and mudguard. Later I removed the back wheel, refitted it, adjusted the chain tension and replaced a headlight bulb. At last. After all these years, I'd taken something to bits and successfully put it all back together again. The sense of satisfaction was bigger than a prop's ribcage; the problems had been fewer than a hooker's braincells. What next then? Well, nothing actually. It's taken a fortnight to get the oil out of my fingers, nightly doses of Ecover washing up liquid notwithstanding. And I've had an allergic reaction to the oil and lithium grease, or maybe it's the Ecover. Green detergent, indeed! My hands are like pumice stones! Bring back Fairy Liquid, old formula, that's what I say! There must be some way of getting lanolin without killing whales, surely? No, these days I'm concentrating on passing my motorcycle test \\u2014 a complex business, even if you have been driving a car on and sometimes off the road for nigh on 20 less than accident-free years. I say concentrating. Actually, it's all theoretical stuff, as frankly it's too cold to do much motorcycling on my wonderfully rebuilt MZ with the chrome mudguard. And there is no cold like motorcycle cold, no rain like an MZ rain. When you've been driving a car, and hirpling about on motorbikes using L plates, as aged car users are allowed to with anything under 125cc or possessing a sidecar, you think you know it all. Having recently braved the innard-freezing weather to sit my CBT (Compulsory Basic Training) motorcycle test part one, I am chastened. For one thing, I'm so old they've changed the rules on driving. You no longer signal when you're pulling out to overtake,(unless to warn fast-approaching traffic behind you); nor do you signal right when pulling out from the kerb. You don't even have to do hand signals. Bad habits surface like bits of forgotten oil slick in a salmon farm. The lifesaver, it is called, that last look over your shoulder before making any kind of manoeuvre on a bike. I've started doing it in the car, too. It helps. But I've now got a trapped nerve in my neck. I remember the days of the old motorbike test, when you just rode around the block a few times while the examiner walked to various points and watched you. In those days motorcycling was black leather and blood, sometimes helmetless. Death rates increased all the time, as hormonally charged adolescents flocked to give it heavy Brando on Honda C50s. Then came the CBT, a drop in deaths and the surest way of reducing youthful hooliganism on bikes: make it too expensive. These days, you just can't get insured at all if you're young and a biker in certain areas. Maybe they should introduce a CBT for climbers, those other willing dicers with death. Impossible to administer, I know, but something has to be done to stop the unbelievable carnage on Scotland's hills. Just as the motorcycling clubs became safety orientated and led the training initiative, so should the climbing clubs recognise their responsibility, even to idiots. I am old, and cheap to insure as a motorcyclist \\u2014 the classic early male menopause returner. The thing is, there is nothing like a bike for sheer visceral excitement. Dangerous it is. Crazy it is, especially on the much longed-for MZ replacement, a Kawasaki ZZ-R1100, capable of massively out-accelerating every car on the road and reaching 175mph along Barassie beach. And all this for less, brand new, than a basic Ford Fiesta. I'm a long way from that, though. I potter and practise on my newly-restored Orange Beast, my socket set in the sidecar and patience at the ready. As long as the weather's fine. Everybody's problem EVEN in Dickens's London street crime was hardly new. But, as today's funeral of the student Paul Sheldon, so needlessly killed, reminds us, it now seems to be more random, thoughtless. The truth of that observation cannot be determined; what is beyond question, however, is that violence in our town centres has become so common that it is an expected, almost accepted, feature of urban life. For younger citizens, going to the disco becomes a risky venture; householders in urban centres suffer disturbances as pubs and clubs with late licences disgorge their clients; car owners fight a daily battle against thieves. There is an element of despair in the public's reaction to the apparent spread of the disease, though the current political and moral debate about crime in general may hold out hope of an antidote. More police officers visibly going about their business is the most commonly advanced solution to street crime. But even if that were the case \\u2014 and the experience of the past 12 years, with an increase in police strength being matched by an increase in reported crime, casts some doubt on it \\u2014 the authorities could not afford to apply it because of their limited resources. They are, instead, using other strategies. In Scotland these include a special campaign to make the carrying of knives an offence; the use of bullet-proof video cameras as a method of town centre surveillance; and, most widely applied of all, a curb on late-night licences. For some tastes these measures, and particularly the last, might seem to be simplistic responses to public outrage \\u2014 based on the old principle of having to be seen to be doing something, anything in a crisis. Yet all the evidence is that most violent crimes occur between 11 pm and 3 am at the weekend, with the largest number happening on a Saturday. Reducing drinking hours, therefore, would seem to be a sensible way of curbing some of the worst examples of drunken violence. The installation of surveillance cameras also seems to work, if Airdrie's experience is anything to go by. True, this remedy contains more than an element of \\u2018big brother\\u2019 and it may be that it does no more than turn the criminals away from the areas covered by the cameras' eyes. Nevertheless it is clearly playing a useful part in a prevention campaign; indeed, the greater the number of elements in such a strategy the better. Such measures may not tackle the root causes, but they may help everyone to recognise the seriousness of the problem. Street crime, after all, is an assault on society as a whole. Daily torture JE Nicholson (Points of View, 10 February) has done more than 5,000 car journeys over the Forth Road Bridge into Edinburgh, only to be habitually overtaken by a man on a tricycle, and has concluded that a new road bridge is not the answer. This is good as far as it goes, but it is a disappointingly mean harvest of wisdom from so much hard-won experience. Why do so many thousands of other commuters go through such daily torture without concluding, not only that another bridge is not the answer, but that it would increase traffic flows into Edinburgh? A good public transport system would be cheaper, faster, safer, more comfortable, and vastly more efficient in energy and space. Perhaps they do not conclude this; if so, why don't they make their views known to the Secretary of State for Scotland before he approves this scheme? Silence now is a vote for expense, inconvenience, accident risk, and further environmental degradation, as witnessed daily by thousands. Twisted trails of blame David Ott examines the UN's tortuous route to secure the prosecution of those committing atrocities in war-torn Bosnia ADVOCATES of the rule of law in international affairs must welcome the decision of the UN Security Council to consider establishing a war crimes tribunal in the former Yugoslavia. But if this is to prove more than gesture politics, a number of challenges must be faced. Some of these are obvious. How will prospective defendants be caught? Will people be prosecuted when their co-operation is needed to implement an eventual peace agreement? On the other hand, can peace really be allowed to depend on the goodwill of people who have already shown their contempt for even basic considerations of humanity? And what chance will peace have if the enraged victims see the criminals escaping scot-free with the spoils of their crimes? None of these problems should be minimised. But even if they are overcome, other more fundamental difficulties will remain. The first of these is crucial: will the prosecution and punishment of Yugoslav war criminals be fair? Predictably, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Dr Radovan Karadzic, has already cried foul on the ground that war crimes in other parts of the world go unpunished. Though not without merit, this argument is weaker here than it might be elsewhere, since the UN plan appears designed to punish all war criminals in the former Yugoslavia rather than to impose international law on one party only. It will not be a case of \\u2018victor's justice\\u2019. But problems remain in connection with the scope of the tribunal's remit. The UN Security Council resolution 808 concentrates on \\u2018violations of international humanitarian law.\\u2019 That is much narrower than the jurisdiction given to the Nuremberg tribunal after the Second World War, which was allowed also to consider crimes against peace and crimes against humanity such as planning and waging of aggressive war and genocide. If the Security Council excludes from the new tribunal's jurisdiction such larger crimes, which are perhaps more likely to be committed by higher state officials, the resulting trials may end up dealing only with the small fry while the big fish get away. This in turn impinges on the problem of deterrents, a point which the French authors of resolution 808 were keen to emphasise. A war crimes prosecution in which high-ranking commanders and political leaders were likely to escape justice would hardly deter people in such positions from continuing their outrages and it could encourage them to press their sometimes morally debased followers to obey orders regardless of their illegality. The plan's success as a deterrent depends as well on how vigorously the UN will back it up with action. The UN must now put its money where its mouth is. Otherwise, raising the issue in the first place could in the end prove counter-productive: if an international war crimes tribunal is clearly revealed to have no teeth, potential offenders may be emboldened to do whatever they like. Punishment of convicted war criminals is also problematic. The Security Council has wisely ruled out the death penalty, however much it might seem justified as retribution. This leaves the problem of where and under what conditions prisoners would serve their sentences. Would those convicted have to be held in the national prisons of UN members? This could expose willing states to charges of being unduly harsh or lenient in their treatment of prisoners and open to acts of reprisal or terrorism from sympathisers of those imprisoned. SOME of these difficulties might be avoided if the United Nations would broaden its approach to consider the possibility of punishing what are now called international crimes. A relatively new concept in international law, this involves the guilt not merely of the rulers and agents of a state but of the state itself. Although proposed by the UN's International Law Commission, the idea has been widely criticised as legally unsound and practically unworkable. But it does have the advantage of operating on a level where guilt or innocence might be easier to establish and where punishment could be imposed on a state basis. Thus if Serbia were convicted of aggression or ethnic cleansing, its punishment might include enforced disarmament, the disgorging of illegally-seized territory, the payment of reparations, and the application of self-determination within its own borders. This would seem to be a more constructive approach than simply locking up individuals. It would also deal with the danger posed by ardent nationalists or super-patriots who might willingly run the risk of themselves being prosecuted for war crimes if they thought their state would gain some permanent benefit from their actions. If these problems can be overcome by the planners who are now setting to work under the direction of the UN Secretary-General, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal could be an important step in strengthening international law. Role models as safe as houses? Did history really end when the Wall came down? A leading French economist believes that the defeat of communism has merely presented capitalism with a new crisis. Keith Aitken examines the argument \\u2018Having no challengers, capitalism now has no mirror in which to examine itself\\u2019 Could the system which tossed British economic policy to the winds of avarice, be described as stable? THERE was always something odd, not to say distasteful, about the triumphant claims in 1989 that what was happening in the awakening democracies of the former eastern bloc was the end of history. For one thing, it proceeded from a peculiarly Marxist view of history as the conflict between capital and labour. For another, it assumed a stability in the capitalist system which, then and since, seemed wildly optimistic. Could the system which, one day last September, tossed two years of British economic policy to the winds of avarice, be described as stable? How stable is a system which cannot employ an increasing proportion of the population, which leaves half the world destitute, which rides a switchback cycle between boom and bust, which piles up tottering mountains of debt? How stable is a system where the amounts of money whizzing around the foreign exchanges in search of a quick fix are 50 times more than the total needed to finance the whole of world trade? How stable, and how coherent? There is a strand of social theory which says that society is defined by its transgressors, that we know the civilised values that bind us together only through their breach, which we call crime. Something of the same analysis can be applied to capitalism. Was it ever anything more homogeneous than the sum total of the systems which were not communism? That might seem to be precisely the sort of querulous argument which the Left has familiarly been scorned for posing. But it is also increasingly explored by the Right, concerned to explain the electoral disillusionment which drove Bush out of office and Major out of Thatcherism. It has now been addressed with elegant passion by no more subversive a revolutionary than the president of Assurances Generales de France, Michel Albert. \\u2018Having no challengers, capitalism now has no mirror in which to examine itself, no alter ego against which to measure its performance. Democracy, liberalism and capitalism are by definition unqualified to exercise any sort of monopoly,\\u2019 he writes. \\u2018How will they manage now that there is, literally, no contest?\\u2019 Now, this is a grand theme, which Albert's book develops with declamatory gallic panache (splendidly translated, incidentally, by Paul Haviland). But he also gives it an edge and an urgency that turn it into much more than an abstract cafe debate. He sees, in the post-communist age, a fresh ideological battle building between two competing bodies of capitalism in which the stakes, not least for Europe, are immense and the choices pressing. This, he believes, is the new mirror image. Albert calls the two rival forms the \\u2018neo-American\\u2019 model and the \\u2018Rhine\\u2019model. Both labels, though as good as any others, are deceptive and need explanation. But his identification of the species is persuasive. The neo-American model might be called the Thatcher-Reagan model, while the Rhine model should also properly include Japan along with Germany, the Benelux countries, Switzerland, Scandinavia and, arguably, Australia and New Zealand. What counts is the increasing divergence between them (and, for a Frenchman, France's continued indecision about which system to pursue). For British readers, the first model \\u2014 which has been in the political, if not the economic, ascendancy for the past decade and more \\u2014 is the more familiar. Its characteristics are personal acquisitiveness, set free by generous tax cuts for the rich and a licensed pursuit of the fast buck; markets, including foreign exchange, left unfettered to bestow their dynamism on the economy; a state rolled as far back as is electorally tenable; and a participatory capitalism, based on profit rather than ownership, where almost anything is a commodity to be traded. The Rhine model, by contrast, values bankers more than brokers. It sees far fewer categories of goods or services as being susceptible to trade, and in particular sees companies as communities rather than  commodities , basing wages on structured scales rather than market rates or productivity achievements. It places high worth on loyalties \\u2014 employee, customer, social \\u2014 and sets a compassionate state at the centre of these values, providing both decent social provision and a regulated environment for fair competition. What this is, at root, is the difference between the free market economy and the social market economy. Albert has no doubts about the moral and social superiority of the latter. It is structured to produce fewer victims. Countries which follow the Rhine model, he says, evolve an economy culture: a consensus of common purpose, in which the economic cycle is insulated from the political cycle, partly through broad political agreement about economic ends and means, partly through independent central banks tied to strong currency policies. Economically, he sees it as the difference between the hare and the tortoise: the free market model with its exciting instability, its romantic success stories, its idealistic zeal; the social market with its patient, unspectacular, benign growth, and its cultural cohesion. Albert writes: \\u2018The inescapable conclusion is that the two models of capitalism diverge on the fundamental question of whether to live for the present moment \\u2014 and to hell with the consequences for future generations \\u2014 or to plan for a better tomorrow, though it may require sacrifices today. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ethical choices facing every society as the 20th century draws to a close.\\u2019 The crucible of these choices is corporate finance. It is a familiar, yet penetrating, criticism of free market economies that the imperatives companies face to satisfy the adolescent greed of the financial markets and the escalating expectations of shareholders \\u2014 or else prepare for predators \\u2014 has diminished the scope of strategic planning to buffing up the next set of interims. The consequence, at worst, is a neglect of research and development, strategic investment and skills training. By contrast, in the \\u2018well-managed consensus\\u2019 of the Rhine model, banks rather than stock markets are the guardians of the capitalist flame, Albert says. Frankfurt's total capitalisation is only a third of the London stock exchange and a ninth of Wall Street, with many of the biggest German companies lacking even a listing. Company finance is the province of the banks, generating the close and patient relationships that power the German economy. The banks are benign, stable shareholders. Most German manufacturers have their \\u2018house bank\\u2019, often a major shareholder and locked into an enduring relationship. By the same token, big manufacturers are often shareholders in their chosen bank. The drawbacks of this relationship are its stolid dullness and its tendency to focus power in a small circle of people. The overriding benefit, however, is its readiness to take the long view. \\u2018One can almost imagine the German banker telling his client, the company president: \\u2018You just take care of improving production and increasing sales, and leave the financial problems to us\\u2019,\\u2019 Albert writes. German \\u2014 or Swiss, or Dutch \\u2014 managers need not waste energy worrying about takeovers. Their job is to build, not always rapidly, better products, systems and markets. During the Eighties, it has been the Thatcher-Reagan model which has enjoyed the higher global vogue. Albert remarks, a touch sniffily: \\u2018An evening at the Crazy Horse Saloon will always make for more compulsive viewing than a day in the life of a Benedictine monastery.\\u2019 Yet there is no question that, across the economic cycle, it has been the Rhine model which has shown far the most robust capacity for growth. Albert's purpose in writing his book, published in the original French two years ago, was to warn a developing European Community against what he saw as the growing dominance of the American way of capitalism. He was not optimistic. He saw the torch which Reagan and Thatcher had lit being borne on by other, apparently unstoppable, hands, while the newer economies, like Walesa's Poland, flocked to its light. Yet, in 1993, the picture is much less clear. Bush has gone. Major's attachment to free market doctrine has been loosened by the public's refusal to let short-termism shut Britain's pits. Both economies have suffered grievously from  recession . By the same token, however, they may now be tacking fitfully back to growth while Germany and, to a lesser extent Japan, linger in relative doldrums. Albert would no doubt shrug philosophically, and say that his analysis concedes that the hare will sometimes run ahead of the tortoise. What is certain is that the time for decision in Europe which he saw approaching then is nearer now, the question no less pertinent. His is a book that deserves to be updated, and deserves to be read. \\u2018Suddenly what seems to be at stake is the Britishness of being Britain' Never before has the nation's mood and morale been at such a low ebb, never before such a vote of no confidence in the country, writes Rob Brown Prepared to vote with their feet WOULD the last one out, please put off the lights! Some people may remember those words being splashed across the front page of the Sun on the eve of last April's general election. Rupert Murdoch's mass circulation tabloid stooped to a new level of vicious scaremongering when it seemed that Neil Kinnock might just succeed in leading Labour back into government. Today, however, the Sun must be wishing that it had held that headline in reserve. For it neatly encapsulates the state of public morale in Britain less than a year into the fourth consecutive Conservative term. In an opinion poll published this week, 49 per cent of the British public said that they would emigrate if they could. There has never been such a vote of no confidence in the country since Gallup began measuring the urge to emigrate in 1948. Rival pollsters have argued that this finding should be handled with some caution. They point out that disenchantment has been swollen no doubt by recent events such as the surge in unemployment past the three million mark, the murder of two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool and even the February weather. But no-one has dismissed it as a rogue poll. Other polling organisations have also detected a profound and longer-term loss of faith in the way Britain is governed. Christopher Harvie, Professor of British Studies at the University of Tubingen in Germany, has observed: \\u2018Britain, after a decade of Thatcherite greed-is-good radicalism is, in many respects, less competitive than it has ever been, its society bitterly divided and disorientated.\\u2019 Harvie penned those words at the beginning of last year. Dramatic developments since then \\u2014 most notably Black Wednesday and the scandals engulfing the Royal Family \\u2014 have only served to heighten this sense of dislocation. That is confirmed by Robert Worcester, chairman of the polling organisation Mori. \\u2018Over the last several decades, there has been a decline, no question about it, in the confidence people have in British institutions,\\u2019 he reports. \\u2018There is a declining belief in monarchy, in Westminster and Whitehall, in the judiciary and in the system of government as a whole.\\u2019 Henry Porter doubtless spoke for many when he wrote recently in the Guardian: \\u2018Little in the post-war years of decline in Britain has prepared us for the deep sense of unease now being experienced by its people. Suddenly what seems to be at stake is not economic and material wellbeing, but the Britishness of being Britain\\u2026 \\u2018We have begun to lose our confidence in our institutions, the traditions and bodies that constitute a very large part of the national culture \\u2014 especially in the monarchy which a year ago appeared to be one of the unassailable certainties of British life.\\u2019 How can our fragmented society make itself whole again? How can a culture permeated by possessive individualism restore the fraying bonds of community? These questions are being asked now not just by political theorists, although some of them are giving the most considered answers. David Marquand, one of Britain's most acute political analysts, has written that \\u2018only a notion of community, of fraternity, can make it a duty \\u2014 as opposed to a compassionate whim \\u2014 to help one's fellows\\u2019. In his book, The Unprincipled Society, Marquand deplored the conception of power and authority that has underpinned Britain's political order since the 18th century. He argued that our existing governmental arrangements are inimical to forging a sense of fraternity. Talk of a new constitution may still be restricted largely to the so-called chattering classes, but the general public seems to have roused from what George Orwell called \\u2018the deep, deep sleep of England\\u2019. In Homage to Catalonia, Orwell wrote despairingly of the fundamental contentment of those who sleep deeply in the belief that the fundamentals are secure. He was referring to that curious mixture of kings, lords and commons which have been the essential elements of Britain's unwritten \\u2014 and until now unchallenged \\u2014 constitution. Republicanism may not be rampant yet, but the Duchess of York's indiscretions and the Prince and Princess of Wales's separation have certainly made it more respectable. Even prominent members of the Labour Party \\u2014 traditionally timid on this front \\u2014 have started to argue openly that the Royal Family's role must be streamlined and modernised if it is to survive for very much longer. Perhaps the nation's mood would be cheerier if we simply had someone else in charge of our existing institutions? Shirley Williams, former Cabinet minister and founder member of the SDP, put forward this thesis last week when she flew back to Britain to be introduced to the House of Lords. Now Professor of Politics at Harvard University, she enthused in a BBC interview about how President Clinton has transformed the mood of America. \\u2018It's amazing what a change of government does,\\u2019 she stated. \\u2018Bill Clinton is not perfect, but the great thing I've seen in America is the lifting of the spirits, the sense of all things being possible again, just because they have brought to an end three administrations which were conservative. \\u2018It's the kind of feeling that a new world has broken, that you get after any very long period of office by one party. I think it could happen in Britain, instead of this feeling of living under a grey blanket, which you somehow have when you're back here.\\u2019 THE vast majority of Americans, it seems, are now behind Clinton. Even many voters who couldn't bring themselves to endorse him last November are prepared to believe in what he calls the politics of hope. America, unlike Britain, is of course a believing culture. As Richard Holloway, the Bishop of Edinburgh, has observed: \\u2018It is a culture that believes in belief\\u2026anyone who has worked on the other side of the Atlantic will recognise the syndrome. It is one that patronising and superior Brits frequently sneer at. The fact remains that for all its crassness and naivety, the American experiment is a colossal testimony to the importance of faith in human life.\\u2019 The US, of course, has a written constitution \\u2014 the only one in the world where the pursuit of happiness is an enshrined goal. Pat McCrystal: led asbestos campaign A LEADING figure in the campaign to help former Clyde shipyard workers suffering from the effects of working with asbestos, Pat McCrystal, has died from the asbestos-related cancer mesothelioma. Mr McCrystal, 68, of Langlands Road, Govan, appeared at many meetings and on television to argue that thousands of workers who had been exposed to asbestos were now being denied justice. Mr McCrystal himself fought a tremendous battle for compensation which was the subject of a Newsnight special report. Bert Connor, chairman of Clydeside Action on Asbestos described Mr McCrystal as unique. \\u2018Pat would never like to be regarded as special but even in his critical condition he was still in fighting spirit.\\u2019 There will be a mass at St Constantine's Church, Govan at 10am tomorrow and he will be buried at St Conval's Cemetery, followed by a reception at Crookston Hotel. Relaxing: a vital part of a pupil's life THE sigh always comes first and it's always a loud one. The books are plonked on the table. Then the elbow joins them as the head is firmly glued to the palm of the hand; it's as if that tired old head was too heavy to hold itself up. This little drama \\u2014 and other scenes like it \\u2014 is played out method-acting style almost every day in this particular household. Yes, it's homework time. But the children here go to a school where a steady and regular dose of homework is the norm. At other schools and in other households, it's different. Many primary age kids are recommended by their schools to take a break from the first three R's and take up another one \\u2014 relaxing. Given that the homework routine of different schools varies, what can the anxious parent do to make sure that their child is getting enough, and what do they need to know about it, if anything? Is the link between home and school strong enough and at what point do you intervene? And can a parent become involved if they are dissatisfied with the homework programme of the school? At secondary school the allocation of homework is usually uniform. There are essays to be done, maths questions to answer and a still life to be drawn at almost every school across the country. But there is no routine at primary school. Sometimes one school will have a set policy and even a policy statement on homework while another will leave it to the individual whim of the teacher. John McCabe, junior school headmaster at St Aloysius College, Glasgow, an independent school, says that homework is an integral part of what the school does. \\u2018It reinforces and give practice to what has been going on during the day,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018Primary 4 and 5 are given an average of 60 minutes conscious homework each evening. In primary 6 and 7 that goes up to one hour l5 minutes.\\u2019 Children at St Aloysius College are given a home work diary which their parents must sign every day. The diary tells the children and parents what is required to be done on any one evening. Mr McCabe says: \\u2018The advice to parents is if a lower school child is struggling after 45 minutes, then don't let them continue. The teacher will look at the problem the next morning.\\u2019 The school believes their homework scheme is very successful. They say that parents who pay for their children's education expect them to be given homework. \\u2018It means children acquire a serious attitude to their school work and it's a good habit,\\u2019 says Mr McCabe. \\u2018It makes them more responsible for their own work and gets them into the idea that they have to work outside normal school hours. They acquire the habit of studying and that is worthwhile.\\u2019 However, this very stringent pattern of homework is not one that many other state schools with primary age children adhere to. At a non-denominational school in the west end of Glasgow a head teacher explained that the maximum time to be spent on homework was half an hour. \\u2018We are of the opinion that if a child is working hard in school they really should be relaxing and doing other things out of it,\\u2019 she said. But what if the parent is not happy with this and believes that their child really ought to be doing more homework? \\u2018It is the school policy. Parents looking for advice on what to do to help with their child's education will be told that the most important thing is to spend quality time talking to their children,\\u2019 the West End headteacher said. She advises worried parents to take their children out to museums, the theatre and cinema, and to make sure that they are getting plenty of interaction with other children. She adds: \\u2018Talking to children is the biggest advantage.\\u2019 At Sciennes primary in Edinburgh, head teacher Maureen Pollock tends to agree. She says that her teachers are keen to make sure that all work should match individual children's needs. Parents are given a school booklet, part of which outlines the school's policy on homework. \\u2018A child's formal education stops at the end of each school day but education continues at all times,\\u2019 it says. \\u2018It is important that children have time to play, pursue interests and hobbies and take part in informal organised activities with other children and alone. For this reason we do not believe in formal homework on a regular basis.\\u2019 At Sciennes, homework is phased in as children approach high school age. Children from Primary 3 upwards do have diaries to keep parents informed if there has been any homework set \\u2014 but is rarely any until Primary 7 age. Different schools have different policies and different children have different homework. What becomes clear is that a parent must listen to the individual school's advice on what they see as the best sort of homework to give and in what amounts. Homework should not be used as a means of controlling children but as a key to the development to their education. And if a school feels that adding that fourth R to the old reading, writing, arithmetic routine then it seems a parent shouldn't expect more. Audrey Gillan Campbell targets emerging talent By Roddy Mackenzie ALLAN CAMPBELL, who took over his new post as national director of coaching and development for the Scottish Badminton Union (SBU) on Monday, has outlined his hopes for the future. Campbell will be spending even less time with Scotland's international players. Indeed, he confirmed yesterday that he would not be coaching Scotland at the forthcoming World Championships in Birmingham (where Scotland are in the same group as Australia). Instead, he will concern himself chiefly on nurturing the grass-roots of the sport during his three-year contract. \\u2018In Australia, sport is geared towards the elite,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018There is no shortage of back-up and if there is a talented athlete, a lot of resources will be poured in to ensure that his or her potential is reached. There are no obstacles put in the way of producing Olympic athletes. \\u2018Whereas the elite side is still very important, my role will be more on the developmental side. I've spent 13 years travelling the world with badminton \\u2014 I was coach to the Australian side at the last World Championships \\u2014 and it will be nice to spend some time at home. \\u2018What we need in Scotland is an eight-court purpose-built badminton hall in every major centre of population. If we can get that, then five or six years down the track we might be producing players who can do something at world level.\\u2019 Anne Gibson, who earlier this month won her fifth successive Scottish women's singles title, is the only Scot to be given a place in the main draw for next month's All England Championships at Wembley. TAKE SIX: Would you emigrate. If so, where would you like to go? Grant MacPhee (18), student, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. \\u2018No, not really. All my friends and family are here so there's no need to emigrate. I like to go on holiday but I always like to come back.\\u2019 Andrew Bridge (20), student, South Clerk Street, Edinburgh. \\u2018Yes. I want to go to the United States to experience a different culture. I'm doing Communication Studies which involves advertising and the media. I reckon the US is geared more towards the media.\\u2019 Mick Bonynge (72), retired, Abbeyhill, Edinburgh. \\u2018I had my chance \\u2018way back in the Forties, but I didn't go. I would not blame the young people for wanting to get away.\\u2019 Tracey Pringle (19), waitress, Bathgate. \\u2018Yes. I'd like to go to Australia because they all seem that friendly and I've got relatives there. Also because of the weather.\\u2019 Pauline Denholm (18), waitress, Bathgate. \\u2018Yes. I'd like to go to America because there are better job prospects over there. I'd like to get out of here and get a better job\\u2026as a funeral director?\\u2019 William Watt (26), joiner, Dumbiedykes, Edinburgh. \\u2018I'd love to emigrate to Australia to get a future and better money. I've got family out there.\\u2019 What do you think? Write to Evening News, Viewpoints, North Bridge, Edinburgh EH1 1YT. BAN BUSTER: Rogue cleric to marry divorcees Rebel priest in mission to Capital by Ian Swanson NEWS REPORTER A REBEL priest who defies church law by marrying divorced Catholics is to conduct a wedding in Edinburgh for the first time next year. Father Pat Buckley, from Larne in Northern Ireland, has been to Scotland on three occasions to tie the knot for couples whom the church refuses to marry because one or both have been divorced. He is due to conduct his first such service in the Capital in July next year. He's also happy to officiate at mixed-religion weddings between Protestants and Catholics, or Christians and Muslims. \\u2018I'm the sort of Jim'll Fix It of marriage problems,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Because of my liberal views and activities, the local bishop removed me from my duties in the parish of Larne eight years ago. \\u2018But I have been working away ever since and they have not done anything more to me. \\u2018They have stated they disagree with what I'm doing. \\u2018But thankfully the days of the rack and burning at the stake are gone, even in Ireland.\\u2019 He still stays in a church house and has converted part of it into a chapel, where he celebrates mass for 200 people every Sunday. He is convinced he is doing the right thing, despite the disapproval of the church authorities. \\u2018All these people could have been married in a registrar's office, but they want a religious and spiritual dimension to their marriage, which I think is very noble of them.\\u2019 The couple from Edinburgh to be married by Father Buckley said they didn't want to talk about their wedding plans. Father Tom Connolly, spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland, said any marriage involving a divorcee would not be valid in the eyes of the church. Hair-raising I THINK it is a great shame that people are still discriminated against because of their appearance. Just recently the case of Malcolm MacKinnon was brought to my attention after you published his story. He was told to have his hair cut or leave his job at Safeway. Was such an ultimatum really necessary? Are shoppers really going to be offended by a ponytail? In my opinion such strict rules and regulations are totally uncalled-for and unnecessary. Dirty I AM disgusted with the inefficiency of our street cleaning operation and recently had to enlist the assistance of my local councillor to get a visitation to my street and surrounding area. Even then they missed considerable stretches of gutter with accumulated dirt. Pavements are a no-go area. North-East Fife District Council operate the old-fashioned system of a man, barrow and brushes and the result is a very high standard of service. The present system in the city of a vehicle with a team of operatives seems to be a costly investment. It seems to be the right time to revert here to the old system. Cool down I HAVE been reading in the News about whether or not there is some justification for today's young men being a bit too pushy towards girls. In other words sexual harassment. All I can say is that there was a young couple putting on a display in an Abbeyhill park recently which would have made my auld granny's hair curl! A pail of ice-cold water over the pair of them would have been the best idea. The young woman was the one who seemed to be \\u2018making the running,\\u2019 but if the young chap had got a bit carried away, no doubt he would have been hauled up to court. I am no prude. I am in my 30s and married, but I am beginning to think the young men are not always to blame. Before Sunday I would not have said that. Danger THE campaign for keeping open Rosyth Dockyard is all very laudable as long as it's not for servicing nuclear submarines. These things are now both dangerous and obsolete. At best, they can entangle the nets of a fishing boat and kill the crew. At worst, they can sink or lose their nuclear warheads at sea. Greenpeace has so far counted 50 nuclear weapons and nine reactors on the sea bed. Both nuclear dockyards should be closed down. The workforce should be retrained and given jobs growing food in greenhouses, as should anyone else who is desirous of employment. nad; Violence I WAS disgusted to read Mr Wilson's reaction to earlier closing of the pubs in Edinburgh. There has been more violence and stabbing on the streets since the hours were extended. After all, tourists don't come here to frequent the bars, most stay in hotels anyway. It's degrading to Edinburgh. We are not safe on the streets, when drunk crazed animals are loose at 1.30am. Poverty's grave luxury WOMEN on low incomes were more than twice as likely to smoke as their better off counterparts, claims a new report out today. It said poorer women saw cigarettes as a \\u2018necessary luxury\\u2019 to cope with the difficulties of caring for a family on a tight budget. And while health education programmes had helped to reduce the habit among men and more affluent women, they had failed to reach females in poorer families. The report, called Her Share of Misfortune and written by the ASH working group on women and smoking, recommends a number of measures to buck the trend. But it said that to get at the root of the problem the Government had to tackle the whole issue of deprivation. Alison Hillhouse, director of ASH Scotland, said: \\u2018Time and time again you hear these women say their first priority is to feed their family and pay their bills. \\u2018They don't have a lot left over for themselves and they see smoking as an affordable luxury which helps them cope.\\u2019 Health education programmes had to be targeted at poorer women and the wider issue of social deprivation tackled. The report also recommends a total ban on all tobacco advertising and promotion, adequate funding for long-term smoking education programmes and legislation to create a smoke-free environment at work and in public places. COPING: Alison Hillhouse says poorer women think smoking helps them cope. CSV Media Action Hypersomnia Have you ever woken up from a full night's sleep still exhausted? Do you often feel like dozing off during the day when you need to be awake? The need for sleep varies from person to person \\u2014 some require more than the average eight hours sleep a night be perfectly normal. However, when the need to sleep interferes with daytime activities, this is a problem known as hypersomnia. Hypersomnia has many causes and can vary in severity from slight drowsiness to falling sound asleep. External factors include excessive heat or poor ventilation. Psychological states such as boredom or depression can lead a person to escape into sleep. Physical illness can lead to extra sleepiness too. Many sleeping pills, antihistamines and other drugs leave the user drowsy during the day, so always check labels for warnings about this side-effect. Lifestyle is important \\u2014 irregular bedtime hours and spending too long in bed can contribute to over-sleepiness. Lounging in bed long after waking can leave you feeling only half-awake all day. Drinking alcohol during the daytime and over-eating can lead to an over-powering desire to nod off (just think of the average household after Christmas dinner). Shift work can cause problem sleepiness since changing rotas and night duties befuddle body clocks. Sleep taken during the day is less refreshing because body hormones triggered by daylight, which aid activity, are fighting against another type of hormone stimulated by sleep itself which aids rest and body repair. With \\u2018sleep apnoea\\u2019(difficulty in breathing during sleep), sufferers literally stop breathing about 400 times a night leading to disrupted slumbers and daytime drowsiness. There are 1.5 million recorded sufferers in Britain and an estimated 2,500 sufferers in Lothian. This condition is recognised by chronic snoring and choking during sleep. The good news is that not everyone who snores occasionally is a sleep apnoea sufferer and also the condition is curable. If in doubt consult your doctor who can refer you for specialist treatment. Dr John Eagles, of the Ross Clinic in Aberdeen, recommends that anyone suffering from excessive sleepiness only during the winter months should consider the possibility of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD affects about one person in twenty and is caused by a hormonal reaction to the lack of natural sunlight in winter. Apart from over-sleepiness, symptoms include: lethargy, overeating, depression, social problems and loss of libido. These symptoms disappear in the summer months. Your doctor will be able to refer you for treatment. This takes the form of light therapy with daylight-simulating lightboxes and sometimes the use of non-sedative anti-depressants. Daytime drowsiness and associated sleep disorders can affect the quality of your life and can cause accidents, especially among drivers. They should never be left untreated. Dr Neil Douglas, Director of The Scottish National Sleep Laboratory, says: \\u2018Anybody who is falling asleep once a day when not in bed should consult their GP to have their sleepiness sorted out.\\u2019 Info pack: Contact Julie Oswald, Media Action 031-557-3194 for your free info pack.

Neil Kinnock exorcised whole covens of militants, dumped the unilateralist millstone, and replaced the old guard of the seventies with eager young men in bright ties. The red flag gave way to the red rose, the \\u2018Red Flag\\u2019 to Purcell and Queen. And still Labour lost: not to Finchley's conquering Britannia, but to a fractious, demoralised Tory Party led by a man little celebrated for his charisma. The search is now on for more negatives to eliminate. Roy Hattersley wants the archaicism of Clause Four erased, a sensible change, though it might cause trouble from the die-hards. There is a debate about whether a ministry for women is a liability. Most importantly, John Smith has finally backed moves to rid the party of what is perceived to be the biggest unwanted legacy remaining of its heritage, the voting power of the trade unions. The unions have become like a resident Grandad \\u2014 no less embarrassing for enfeeblement, but still handy with his wallet. Still capable, too, of making a scene if slighted. So, Mr Smith cautiously  withheld support for eviction until such time as he felt the old boy was sufficiently reconciled to moving out. While there is little doubt that reform is the right course, the old sneer about Labour being in the pockets of union barons has actually lost any real justification. Legislation has reduced the barons to serfdom, and it is some time since they seriously hampered leadership policy (more often, lately, they have helped defeat constituency insurrection). They are certainly a less pervasive influence than are the boardroom knights who sign over company funds to the Conservatives. But they are much more conspicuous. The block vote makes terrible television, as millions of votes are marshalled on behalf of union members with little or no loyalty to the party. The Wembley electoral college formula, giving the unions a bigger say in electing Labour's leader than either activists or parliamentarians, was a triumph of defiance over common sense. The unions, facing their own penury, have in any case proved decreasingly willing to bankroll a party incapable of winning elections. Party leaders now hope that sufficient union members can be persuaded to affiliate in their own right both to keep the financial wolves from the door and to revitalise a sometimes decaying local structure. It is the correct approach, but it is not enough. Labour's real problem is not avoiding offence, but achieving product differentiation. Its lacklustre showing in the opinion polls during the Government's recent travails shows that good reasons for not voting Tory are not the same as good reasons for voting Labour. Mr Smith is right to shed old baggage, but he will have to offer voters something more than dull blamelessness. The real test ahead is whether the policy review can generate a coherent body of distinctive ideas that afford electors positive incentives to vote Labour. Preventing own goals is a prudent tactic, but it usually takes more to win. Vulnerable I am appalled at the mores that exist in this country today. A young child brutally killed, a mother in anguish because she turned her back for seconds: it is a reflection of the society we now live in. We do have a death penalty, but it's for the vulnerable, the young, the old and disabled. Nowadays the victims are blamed for being vulnerable. Morality in this land is a lame duck. People of privilege abuse it blatantly. The Government encourages exploitation of most of us by preying on the fears of the employed and the misery of the unemployed. With models like these can humanity survive? We are now living with the law of the jungle. Diminishing role of psychiatric hospitals in many areas The letter (16 February) on behalf of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland gives a reasoned and balanced account of the present legal framework. This can enable those who, because of mental illness, may pose a significant risk to their own health or safety or the safety of other people and who are limited in self-awareness, to accept treatment or care, whether or not including medication. While the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 is undoubtedly superior to the English legislation in regard to the use of extensions of the leave of absence provisions, this seems to me to be a less than satisfactory way of addressing the problem for a number of reasons, both practical and philosophical. Furthermore, though the number of persons suffering from a mental disorder who cannot be helped on a voluntary basis is relatively small, the number of such persons in the community is likely to increase. This is because of the current emphasis on care in the community and the reduction in the number of beds, particularly long-stay or continued care beds, in the psychiatric hospitals. Indeed the psychiatric hospitals themselves may, in many areas, cease to exist. From the practical point of view, the use of the leave of absence provisions can cause problems in keeping track of the renewal documentation, particularly if a doctor has a number of patients on leave of absence. It can cause problems if patients' case records are held at the place from which they went on leave of absence, but they are being seen for review elsewhere or are attending some other facility such as an out-patient clinic or a day hospital. It can complicate the management of in-patients beds if beds have to be kept available to accommodate persons on leave of absence who may relapse and require urgent readmission and it can distort the patient statistics. Despite the fact that current legislation does make some attempt to provide a legal framework governing the treatment of the mentally ill, its central focus remains that of detention. Is it not time to look afresh at the foundations of our laws in relation to mental illness with a view to making the central focus that of providing a framework whereby those whose judgment is so impaired by their illness that they are unable to recognise the need for treatment will receive such treatment in as humane, sensitive and effective a way as possible. This would be irrespective of whether that treatment involves hospitalisation or not. I refer to a legal framework that protects without stigmatising, which recognises and takes account of the needs of society in general, the needs of the families and carers, and the needs of the individual and which provides as equitable a balance as possible between the individual's rights of autonomy and liberty and the right to have access to the best possible treatment, rehabilitation and care. This would be with the minimum of bureaucracy and social alienation. Security check You published last week an account of our ordeal at the hands of burglars who left us barricaded for 37 hours in a tiny bathroom. We have lived in this peaceful west Stirlingshire village for 32 years, and thought the risk of it happening to us was negligible. Now we know differently, having opened our door after dark to persons we did not know or recognise. Our hope is that this letter will be a warning to others and that some of your readers may be alerted to check on their security arrangements, whether it be simple precautions or advice about a security installation. Our local police have been most helpful. We have received so many messages and letters that it is just not possible to acknowledge them individually. We would like to thank all those well-wishers most warmly for their support. Homelessness Glasgow University's recently published study of homelessness among the young in Scotland simply highlights the facts which have been known to anyone who had been working in the social security system in whatever capacity for a number of years. The changes which came into place in April 1988 have had a devastating effect on young people. At the stroke of a pen they removed hundreds of thousands of needy youngsters from the benefit system and condemned many of them to a life of mendicant poverty, many also slipped into prostitution. In desperation, in many cases, young females deliberately become pregnant because they know that once they are in that state they are immediately restored to the benefit system. Moreover, there is at least a possibility that local authorities will house them and their rent will be paid under housing costs. However, there is a snag, even in this desperate solution, in that the changes also withdrew the facility which was available under supplementary benefit to make single payments for furniture etc. Prior to 10 April, 1988, a young person in this situation could apply to the Department of Health and Social Security, as it then was, for a single payment grant for essential items of furniture. The apparatus put in its place, of social fund grants and social fund loans, is widely and almost totally discredited. I do not suggest that to restore benefit to 16 to 18-year-olds would solve this problem overnight, but it would go far down the road to alleviating this problem which surely must be unacceptable in 1993. The UN was designed to oversee global peace and security, but how can it fulfill this primary task in the violent post-Cold War era? asks Paul Wilkinson Nations must unite to close credibility gap HOPES that the ending of the Cold War would lead to a new era of peace have been rudely dashed. No-one should underestimate the enormous gain in freedom for millions who had been trapped in the oppression of communist dictatorships, but the speed with which the liberation of eastern Europe occurred was so stunning that it raised what we can now see to have been unrealistic expectations of the transition to peace, democracy, and prosperity. Five of the successor states in the former Soviet Union are wracked by bitter ethnic civil war and rebellion. In Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and many other poverty-stricken countries, the brutal violence of local warlords combined with the effects of drought, have brought death by starvation to hundreds of thousands. And in Bosnia, in the very heart of a supposedly prosperous and civilised continent, we have seen acts of genocide and other war crimes comparable in horror to those of the Hitler and Stalin regimes. As I survey the 25 conflicts raging in different parts of the world, I am haunted by Yeats' lines: \\u2018The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned;\\u2019 Post-Cold War, the world is proving to be a more violent place. In the Cold War, the nuclear balance of terror did bring a semblance of peace, based on mutual deterrence, alliance systems, and spheres of influence. But now the international system is in a dangerous and unpredictable stage of transition. The internal collapse of the Soviet super power has left America as the most powerful nation state, but there is no new global balance of power. This leaves the US as the nearest thing the world has to a globocop, the only major power able to project its military forces on a global scale. Starving Somalis, and now it seems, starving Bosnians, and many others have reason to be grateful that the generous conscience of America can still be roused to action, often at major risk to American lives. President Clinton's decision to airlift desperately needed aid supplies into Bosnia, his first major foreign policy decision, shows that America still has an outward-looking, fundamentally internationalist, leadership. But there are strict limits to what even American resources can achieve. US citizens want their government to solve their huge domestic economic problems. There is also an abiding reluctance to see America getting drawn in to another Vietnam, a bitter and protracted war exacting a huge price in US lives and treasure. We should not underestimate the courage it must have taken for Clinton to give the go ahead to the Bosnian airlift. IN the longer term, the only real hope of establishing an effective system of global peace and security is the UN. This is the primary task for which it was originally designed. For nearly 45 years, it was unable to function properly because it became a political battleground in the Cold War. Time and again action by the Security Council was blocked by the veto power of the Soviet Union and other permanent members. Yet the UN ideals embodied in the Charter still retained respect and moral authority because most people knew it was not the UN's fault that the Security Council was paralysed. And, in spite of its huge handicaps, the UN was able to improvise some extremely successful peace-keeping operations, for example in the Middle East, and to show its effectiveness in social and economic development through the work of agencies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Now this has all changed. Quite suddenly the UN has moved to the centre stage of world politics. With the ending of the Cold War, Russia showed its willingness to co-operate with other permanent members on major issues of peace and security. This was vividly demonstrated when the UN took steps to oppose Iraq's aggression against Kuwait. The coalition against Saddam was able to operate under the aegis of the UN with the full authority of Security Council resolutions behind it. This was a great boost to UN authority, but of course it has also This has raised expectations of similar operations to deal with major challenges to peace and massive violations of human rights elsewhere. But the harsh fact is that the UN was able to operate effectively in liberating Kuwait because it suited US national interests to undertake this task; and America and its allies clearly preferred to operate with the Security Council's approval. Lacking any military forces of its own, the UN is pathetically dependent on the goodwill of its most powerful members. This carries two great dangers: It risks damaging the UN's moral authority and reputation for impartiality if it is seen as the vehicle of superpower foreign policy; it causes huge embarrassment to the UN when, because of its own priorities, the US is unable to help, and the UN is then confronted with the question why have you failed to act decisively in our crisis while you were willing to do so in the case of Iraq's aggression? Another important aspect of the changing role of the Security Council is its new attitude to the principle of absolute sovereignty of member states over their internal affairs. In the bold decision to set up the Kurdish safe-havens and the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq after the Gulf war, and the decision to intervene militarily in Somalia, we see a significant departure from the principle of absolute sovereignty over domestic matters. Peace-keeping operations have also significantly changed in emphasis. The demand for the UN's peace-keeping services has risen alarmingly, overstretching the organisation's near bankrupt resources. Since 1988, the UN has been called upon to mount 13 peace-keeping operations, as many as in the entire 23 years up to 1987. Many of these new operations, such as United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia have performed a whole range of difficult civilian tasks in addition to the military aspects of peace-keeping. For example, in Namibia, UNTAG not only had to ensure that the ceasefire was observed; it also went on to tackle a programme of repatriation, and oversee the first elections for the new state. It was a huge, though little known success for the UN and the people of Namibia. Ninety-seven per cent of those qualified to vote did so and a new democratic constitution was adopted by unanimous vote. The role of civilian experts, ranging from police to specialists in elections and administration, has become a crucial part of the UN peace-keeping package. Despite such successes in imaginative shoestring operations, the UN is desperately in need of reform and strengthening if it is to meet the critical tests of the post-Cold War era. The great merit of the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's Agenda for Peace report to the Security Council summit last year is its tough-minded and realistic assessment of the kind of reforms so urgently required. The huge gap between the UN's resources and capabilities on the one hand and the expectations of UN help in every crisis around the world is highlighted by the organisation's financial crisis. By May 1992, member states owed the UN a total of more than \\u00a31 billion towards the cost of its peace-keeping and regular budgets. AGENDA for Peace estimates the current annual cost of UN peace-keeping at nearly $3 billion. Yet, as the report points out, global defence expenditures of the member states are estimated to total almost $1 trillion per year. The report makes the excellent proposals that member states should plan to finance their peace-keeping contributions from defence, rather than foreign affairs, budgets. This makes excellent sense when one recognises that the UN's operations are actually helping to save further defence costs by preventing escalation into wider wars and by providing a form of collective burden sharing for peace-keeping purposes. The report also calls for new reserve funds for UN peace-keeping to be urgently established. One of Boutros-Ghali's most important proposals is for a strengthening of preventive diplomacy, particularly through the Chapter VI peaceful dispute revolution mechanisms of the Charter. If greater efforts were put in at this level at an early stage, through early warning on emerging conflicts, many major wars could be prevented. But Boutros-Ghali is no woolly-minded liberal. He fully realises that there are situations when the world organisation must be able to use military force. He wants the preventive deployment of UN peace-keeping forces in order to prevent hostilities breaking out, as is now being attempted in Macedonia. The report also emphasises the need for the UN to face up to the responsibilities of peace enforcement when peaceful diplomacy, economic sanctions and all other measures have failed. Currently, the UN as such has no way of implementing its enforcement powers under Chapter VII. It depends entirely on the goodwill of America and other richer member states to take this on an improvised basis. The Secretary General recommends that earmarked forces should be provided for the UN to give it a permanent rapid deployment force with all the requisite logistic and technical support and air and sea lift capabilities. Former President Bush indicated America's readiness to offer US military lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to support peace-keeping operations. This was a generous offer and the Secretary General is already, in the case of the Bosnian airlift plan, showing how dependent the UN continues to be on the generosity of Uncle Sam. But is this really fair or desirable? Is it not time that we took the Agenda for Peace seriously and gave the UN the resources it needs to save this and future generations from the scourge of war. Boutros-Ghali's proposals are directed as much to the citizens of member states as to their governments. If our peace-loving citizens really care about the future of our world organisation, they must help to create the momentum for reform by mandating our politicians to adopt, at least as a beginning, the urgently-needed measures recommended by the Secretary General. Feel the force: peace-keeping operations have changed in emphasis and demand for the UN's services has risen alarmingly Pressing need: Boutros Boutros-Ghali fully realises that there are situations when the world organisation must be able to use military force. He wants the preventive deployment of UN peace-keeping forces in order to prevent hostilities breaking out, as is now being attempted in Macedonia A criminal tendency to apportion blame Increasing violence has led society to root out scapegoats, but new research in Scotland suggests that those fingered don't fit in the frame, says Mike Wilson MORAL panic is one of the more enduring items on the domestic cultural menu and in a month of fatal stabbings, horrific child murder and economic gloom, society seems once again all too willing to frighten itself to death. And to root out scapegoats. This week's focus is on juvenile delinquents. But not far behind in the firing line are welfare-dependent single-parent families, now so used to being vilified it seems time to offer a blindfold and last cigarette. It is they, say critics, who most accurately reflect the health of the welfare state in the late 20th century: an underclass of the dependent, the criminal and the morally degenerate. But according to research released yesterday, the facts don't quite fit the script. Children of welfare-dependent single-parent families have neither a monopoly on juvenile crime nor a disdain for conventional values. It seems the only thing which divides the underclass from the rest of society is cash. The findings, which will appear later this year as a chapter of a book, are those of Edinburgh University's Richard Kinsey. What they amount to is an appeal for calm. His apparent heresy is not that of the smooth talking cleric, but the statistician specialising in the field of criminology. Crime, Deprivation and the Scottish Urban Environment is a simple exercise in gathering facts, \\u2018a mapping the contours of crime in Scotland\\u2019, says Kinsey. But in a debate often skewed by anecdote and rhetoric, its steady empirical analysis makes it one of the most significant critiques of the underclass to emerge. Kinsey defines the underclass by turning to a bibliography spanning Social Darwinism to Monday's Daily Mail, via Sir Keith Joseph and the US political scientist Charles Murray, published recently in the Sunday Times. \\u2018Broadly speaking,\\u2019 says Kinsey, \\u2018these writers share the following claims: Firstly, for a section of the population \\u2014 in practice the unemployed poor \\u2014 the availability of state benefits provides a basic financial guarantee allowing choices to be made and actions pursued, which previously were unavailable due to the constraints of the labour market. \\u2018Secondly, the welfare state has unwittingly provided \\u2018incentives\\u2019 for non-participation in work, education and \\u2018family life\\u2019, evidence of which is visible in the rejection of the work ethic, the relaxation of moral standards and the emergence of the \\u2018dependency culture\\u2019. \\u2018And finally, evidence of the growing underclass is to be found in the increase in single-parent families, the increase in crime, and the lack of attachment to \\u2018conventional\\u2019 values. These \\u2018symptoms\\u2019, it is said, are most prevalent among young people living in poor areas.\\u2019 TO test this, Kinsey has analysed the results of one of the biggest surveys of its kind in Europe, consisting of carefully-monitored questions put to 3,500 young people from all walks of life in Edinburgh and the Lothians. If the underclass theorists have got it right, argues Kinsey, then nowhere will it be more apparent than among the children of welfare-dependent single-mother families. It will be they who commit the most crime, it will be they who will stick two fingers up to conventional mores. But the underclass theorists seem to have got it wrong. Young people from welfare-dependent single-parent families just aren't artful dodgers ready to graduate into serious crime and a moral vacuum. Sure, nearly 60 per cent of them admitted committing some sort of crime or incivility in the nine months prior to being questioned. But at 60 per cent offending, such children were being no more criminal \\u2014 and sometimes considerably less criminal \\u2014 than their more affluent peers. Such as latch-key kids from middle-class backgrounds. In contrast, in single-parent families where the adult was working, the offending rate shot to 74 per cent. In two-parent families, where no adults were in work, the corresponding figure was 46 per cent, which rose to 55 per cent when one of the adults was in work and 59 per cent when both adults were in work. On the basis of these figures, the issue of juvenile crime seems less to do with welfare dependency, and more to do with after-school child care. Where the findings are even more startling involves the social attitudes of young people. Far from rejecting conventional values \\u2014 for example towards family relationships, school work and the environment \\u2014 underclass children expressed higher levels of concern than those from other backgrounds. \\u2018Of all the groups of young people questioned,\\u2019 says the findings, \\u2018the children of welfare-dependent single mothers consistently recorded the highest levels of anxiety about their prospects for: their future (66 per cent); their school work (75 per cent); other members of their family (88 per cent); personal relationships with others (90 per cent); and even on green issues and the environment (74 per cent).\\u2019 SAYS Kinsey: \\u2018What we have seen in newspaper editorials and in political speeches over a period of time, is a latching on to the problem of crime and a series of assertions about the so-called welfare-dependent underclass. In my view, those arguments are based on very little research, hyperbole and appeal to the most crude stereotypes. And they have become a Trojan Horse to undermine some very basic and strongly-held principles of welfare and the welfare state.\\u2019 He is backed by Adrian Sinfield, professor of social policy at Edinburgh University, whose concern is that attacks on the welfare state are being carried out in a climate of increasing economic inequality and worsening poverty. \\u2018Poverty is increasing and it's being called dependency. Over the last decade, benefits for the unemployed have been cut in some 50 different ways so that the living standards of those out of work have fallen even further behind those of other citizens.\\u2019 Since 1950 the number of those unemployed for more than a year has increased from 34,000 to more than a million at the start of this year. According to information just released, only a quarter of the unemployed are supported by a National Insurance benefit, while two thirds are forced to rely on means-tested schemes. If there is to be a debate about welfare benefits, argues Sinfield, it must include the benefits accorded to the well-off, such as mortgage relief. \\u2018For example, the \\u00a310 billion of revenue lost in supporting occupational and personal pensions for the generally better-off must be set alongside the \\u00a36 billion spent on means-tested benefits for the poorest old people.\\u2019 Richard Kinsey's final warning is that while it would be inappropriate to translate research conducted in Scotland to England, \\u2018vice versa you cannot generalise from the experience south of the Border to Scotland where we have a very different style of policing, a very different system of juvenile justice and a very different welfare structure.\\u2019 HISTORY is full of unexplained mysteries, for which no current solutions have ever been found. Someone reported a long time ago that an old lady, on her deathbed, was heard to say: \\u2018Weel, it will be a great blessing to hear at last the real truth of the Gowrie conspiracy\\u2019. Other mysteries abound, like what are the facts about Darnley's death? And these Casket Letters? And who wrote the Canadian Boat Song? And, if it comes to that, what are the facts behind the publication of the song The Road to the Isles? Or, still in history, what about the Douglas Larder? We all carry a few purely personal mysteries, some of which will never be solved in this life, but may continue to gnaw for all our years. My great one is: How did Jim MacDougall die? There is a lesser one, which still remains an irritation. It occurs in a book called The Scots Week-end, published by the Carswells in the late 1930s, and crying out for some other publisher to take it up and put it on the market, where it would be grabbed by many eager Scots. Catherine and Donald Carswell were a husband and wife literary team who flourished at the same time as another pair, Willa and Edwin Muir. Their book was published by Routledge, and a fine and stimulating rag-bag it is, with the best poems and songs and dance instructions and recipes and a whole round-up of the traditional  wisdom of Scotland, if there be any. A section called An Examination Paper is where I met my downfall. They set a number of questions on many subjects whose answers are readily available, but there is one above all which still scuppers me, especially as there are no solutions in the book nor in any subsequent edition. They mention the poem Lord Ullin's Daughter, and the question they put is: \\u2018O who be ye would cross Loch Gyle, This dark and stormy water?\\u2019 (and then they go on) \\u2019 Do you see anything in the boatman's question to suggest that he was the village idiot?\\u2019 I don't get it. Crackdown against nuisance tenants COUNCIL tenants in East Lothian were warned yesterday about terrifying their neighbours with anti-social behaviour. The district council housing committee signalled a crackdown on those who used and dealt in drugs, caused nuisance and disturbance and threatened neighbours. The action proposed could throw families out in the street. They would then be tagged as intentionally homeless. The hard line is part of a housing policy review on anti-social behaviour agreed by councillors. \\u2018Unfortunately there are people with a total lack of respect for anyone or anything and the problem has grown,\\u2019 Councillor Tom Ferguson said. \\u2018There has always been a problem, to a degree, of anti-social behaviour. People are coming to us in great distress. They are being frightened to death.\\u2019 Councillor Norman Murray said that the signal to unsocial tenants should be quite clear and had to be backed up with swift and firm action. A report to the committee from the director of housing, Bruce Walker, said that complaints about bad neighbours in East Lothian had increased and become more serious. Drugs were playing a bigger and more worrying part. Councillors were told that a pilot scheme was to start in the Northfield-Coalgate area of Tranent in the spring with the support of Tranent Community Council, the police, Scottish Homes and the residents' association. It would include a telephone helpline for bad neighbour complaints. If it succeeds, similar schemes are likely across East Lothian. The committee chairman, Councillor Pat Fawcett, said eviction would be the last resort as it showed failure. It was Macaulay who said that there was no more absurd (and after the scenes in Liverpool I would say horrifying) spectacle than \\u2018the English having one of their periodic fits of morality\\u2019. How salutary, therefore, after the hysteria of AA Miller's letter to find, immediately to hand, the antidote of Nigel Bruce's down-to-earth common sense. Perhaps it is not generally known that David Farrington's research on criminal careers suggests that the single most effective crime prevention policy is nursery education, which is denied to so many children in inner city areas. We also know that alcohol is the single most important cause of violence, not just directly, but also through the abuse committed on children by violently drunk parents. It is time we acted, not on the basis of hysteria, but on the basis of these and other related findings. As the communal conscience is examined, in an avalanche of detail, after the death of little James Bulger, there are certain aspects of  contributory neglect which must be of great concern to everyone. First of all we must rid ourselves of the belief that punishment is wrong if it causes pain or inconvenience and does not have the full interest of the criminal at heart. The criminal rarely considers ours. A surfeit of sympathy for the offender has brought this country to a level of tolerance which is an affront to the ordinary person's conception of justice and retribution. We must acknowledge, as we have done in the past, the fact that a physically painful experience at an early age, in the interests of discipline, is of more lasting value than a stream of compassionate understanding showered on a delinquent at a later stage. On this score there is much to deplore and despise in the activities of those who have systematically contributed to the breakdown of our society by embracing policies which have removed, progressively, the props of discipline and authority. A catalogue of misconceived ideas has preceded our descent into chaos. They include the misguided, idealistic supporters of STOPP, who have eroded discipline in schools by describing a remedial stroke with a tawse or cane as a \\u2018beating\\u2019 or a \\u2018thrashing\\u2019. Then there is the slack legislation passed by parliamentarians far removed from the sharp end of society and the liberal-minded intellectuals living in \\u2018Cloud-cuckoo-land\\u2019 where tolerance for the assailant takes precedence over the suffering of the victim. We also have an over-compassionate bench and judiciary more concerned with the theory of justice than with its practical implementation. Many parents, irrespective of class, must also stand condemned for similar dereliction of duty. The fact that the average adult spends a minimum of 26 hours sitting in front of a  television set in any one week represents not only time lost in sharing activities with their children and young people, but time lost in influencing and controlling them. Ailing economy While I am only too well aware of the ailing state of the UK economy, I cannot help but agree with the comments made by both Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Jim Wallace, and SNP employment spokesman, Roger Mullin, in response to yesterday's announcement of record Scottish unemployment figures of something in excess of 260,000. In appropriately \\u2018watery\\u2019 metaphors, Mr Wallace spoke of the Government's economic strategy in Scotland \\u2018sinking beneath the waves,\\u2019and Mr Mullin expressed concern that \\u2018Scotland is being dragged down by the sinking ship of the UK\\u2019. In response to R C Sneddon's letter today, I am afraid that I cannot offer any foolproof plan for economic recovery. However, I can agree with comments made by others that the way forward lies in a package of investment in small business, training and education to enable us to capitalise on the skills which exist. We cannot simply allow ourselves to cash in on private sector industry at the expense of the many unemployed and low-paid whose living standards will inevitably decline as a result of the spiralling costs of wholesale privatisation. Finally, at the risk of once more being accused of expressing my opinions in emotive terms, I believe that we in Scotland must seek, by whatever means possible, to establish a Scottish parliament. TV violence I write on your article today on whether television affects children's behaviour. In July 1972 I spent a whole afternoon discussing teaching and children with the headmaster of what corresponded roughly to a middle school. It was in a remote rural area, Holmavik, a village of 300 inhabitants in the north-west peninsula of Iceland. I asked about discipline, wondering how it compared with that at the central Scotland school where I taught. The headmaster said that there had been no problems until the introduction of television. After that they had begun to encounter the behavioural problems which had been occurring in Reykjavik and which are so depressingly familiar to us all. As a youngster in the 1950s my greatest delight was to run on to the pitch at Murrayfield after the full-time whistle, pat my heroes on the back and not wash my hands for a week, much to the disgust of my mother. For reasons unknown this privilege has only recently been denied the young rugby followers of today. At the Scotland-Wales match I was severely reprimanded by a steward 30 years my junior for daring to place one foot on the hallowed turf as I made my exit from the \\u2018schoolboys\\u2019 enclosure\\u2019. Does the alleged damage caused to the turf really warrant this control, as opposed to the pleasure gained by youngsters being allowed to run on to the pitch after the game? Shrinking A few years ago, I wrote expressing my concern that the village of West Linton, Peeblesshire, had \\u2018moved\\u2019 from being 18 miles outside the GPO in Edinburgh to 16 and then to 14 miles. This fact was verified as being 16 by the road-sign in the village itself, but it had shrunk to 14 via an advertisement in your newspaper. Needless to say, I was treated like a crank, was completely ignored by the so-called \\u2018experts\\u2019 and in general was subjected to ridicule by people who ought to know better, namely my own family! Nonetheless I must stand my ground and restate that not only did it happen then, but it is getting worse! In a recent advertisement for a house sale the same village of West Linton is now only 11 miles from Edinburgh. How much longer will everyone ignore this phenomenon? Scottish cringe I am intrigued by James Rougvie's description of St Margaret, in today's report on Dunfermline's 900th anniversary celebrations, as \\u2018the Hungarian princess who civilised Malcolm Canmore\\u2019. Is this Dunfermline's official line? If so, it shows the town suffering more than its fair share of the Scottish cringe. I doubt if many Scottish historians would take this line nowadays. Personally, I tend to see Malcolm's marriage to Margaret as part of a process by which our king invited in a team of management consultants from the Continent in order to alienate the land even further from the people. Well, that's one kind of civilisation; maybe. Overheard on the Bathgate to Edinburgh train last Saturday, as a passenger observed rugby fans tucking into champagne and chicken legs in the Murrayfield car park: \\u2018Well, hen,\\u2019 she observed to her companion, \\u2018that's the biggest car-boot sale ah've ever seen.\\u2019 Michael Conway\",\n          \"Vauxhall announced on May 28 that all 5,128 of its UK Corsas were being recalled because of an electrical fault. But yesterday the company confirmed that faulty wiring had, in some cases, led to cars burning. \\u2018It's a question of some of the wiring not being routed in the correct way and in some cases this has caused a chafing or a short circuit,\\u2019 said a Vauxhall spokesman yesterday. \\u2018In most cases that we heard there was no real problem, but in some cases there was fire so we decided to have the recall as a purely precautionary move.\\u2019 The work on the Spanish built cars is being done free of charge. Models such as Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, appeared in TV adverts for the Corsa. The car received more publicity when a feminist group complained that shots of Naomi appearing in a leather outfit complete with whip in a fantasy bondage scene was \\u2018sexist and disgusting\\u2019. However, the Independent Television Commission ruled that the adverts were more tongue-in-cheek rather than sinister or sexist and that, in any, case the Naomi Campbell one had been moved to a post-9pm slot. A replacement for the Nova, the Corsa was ninth in the May 1993 UK top ten sellers list. By Daily Post Correspondent THE new hi-tech scanner used when surgeons battled to try and save the life of IRA bomb victim Tim Parry is to be dedicated to his memory. Twelve-year-old Tim was the first patient on the \\u00a3500,000 scanner as he clung to life after suffering horrific head injuries in the Warrington bombing outrage. The surgeons' battle was in vain and Tim died but now the Computed Tomograph (CT) Scanner is to be named after him. It will be officially opened by his parents, Colin and Wendy Parry, at a special ceremony at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, on June 28. Representatives of Everton Football Club are expected to be present. Tim, from Great Sankey, was a dedicated fan of the club and had been shopping for an Everton strip on the day of the Bridge Street bombing. Players who visited him during his final days in the Walton Centre gave him an Everton shirt which was later buried with him. The Philips Tomascan LX CT Scanner had only just been installed at Walton when the bombings took place. Tim was transferred there from Warrington General Hospital so it could be used. A Regional Health Authority spokesman said: \\u2018It is superior in design to older models. Imaging quality has been vastly improved and now includes a 3D facility.\\u2019 In the meantime, the tendering process for the purchase of Warrington's own CT scanner has started following a major boost for fund-raisers since the bombings. Scanner appeal co-ordinator Jack Froggatt said: \\u2018The town centre bombings raised awareness of the need for a scanner in Warrington and money has been coming in much quicker since then.\\u2019 It is now hoped to reach the \\u00a31m target by the autumn. The trustees administering the appeal fund set up for victims of the bombings have now approved the design of a memorial to be placed in Bridge Street at the scene of the atrocity.

I'm not interested in taking a position on this sort of thing at all, but I am interested in understanding what it means to say that someone \\\"coerced\\\" another person to act as they did.\\nPerhaps the most important aspect of coercion is that the subject doesn't have the option of doing something else other than what he or she does. I think there are two problems with this:\\nFirst, it seems that this notion of freedom must be understood relative to a context. It may well be true that if you're sitting in your chair and I am threatening to kill your family unless you jump off a cliff, then there is no meaningful way for you to resist my demands. But if I am in prison, then surely we can imagine a scenario wherein I could resist your demands by simply dying rather than jumping.\\nSecondly, it seems that we must make sense of the possibility that an individual has the option of doing nothing at all. If you threaten me and I don't jump, then I clearly have done something other than what you want. Surely this counts as resistance? Perhaps so, but that's why I brought up the case of suicide - perhaps in certain cases, refusing to jump would count as resistance because one is choosing death over life.\\nThus, I find myself wondering whether it really makes any sense to talk about \\\"coercion\\\" in terms of options being eliminated from consideration when there is always the option of doing absolutely nothing at all. Certainly in a world without God, the only way that I can understand how one could be \\\"coerced\\\" to do anything is if they had no choice at all. This seems to imply some kind of metaphysical necessity of action. And yet, if we are talking about the natural world, then I don't see how any such notion is possible.\\nPosted by Mike T at 10:32 AM\\nLabels: ethics, philosophy\",\n          \"A combined transformation In a recent paper, Halilsoy (1988 b ) has considered a technique which he applied initially in the context of colliding shock electromagnetic waves (Halilsoy, 1988 a ). He used this method to derive an expression for the polarization angle of the scattered radiation. In his present work, he considers a different problem: that of obtaining an analytical solution for the Bessel-Gauss function Jg (x) by using a combination of a transform technique and the recurrence relation of the hypergeometric functions (Halilsoy, 1987). The derivation is based on a theorem due to H. Schumacher (Schumacher, 1953), who derived an explicit formula for the Bessel-Gauss function.\\nWe consider the wave equation in a semi-infinite medium, in one dimension, and we assume that there are no sources. We use the inhomogeneous Fourier integral transform to determine the Green's function. This transform has been derived by several authors, e.g., Vaksman (Vaksman, 1968), Kalashnikov (Kalashnikov, 1969), and Kryukov (Kryukov, 1972). We first consider the case where the incident plane wave is linearly polarized.\",\n          \"Merely perplexing, at times.\\nThe Wiggles is an Australian children's group which has been around for awhile and is very popular there. Their music video of \\\"Toot Toot\\\" (the first song on their DVD) has now become the most viewed YouTube clip ever with 75 million views in four months. It may be that there are other videos out there that have been seen by more people but those numbers are not as reliable since they can only count how many times someone clicks to watch the whole video instead of just watching part of it. There are some very strange videos on YouTube, including one that is almost entirely animated with some interesting ideas about what people want from a relationship, so I think that this number means something.
