This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

Susanna's one  doesn't really work at all, but  my one's just like  lukewarm. Oh well, let's have a look. Let's have a look at this  So  then, this we did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess  No. around and try and do any more.

It's a sa kinda ratchet type thing. Oh. Just that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough. Just  thingie that Still, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out? No, not let the water out, you let the air out. When you bleed  Oh I see. it you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it. Oh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that Oh it's alright. but it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively. I mean, obviously it's off now but erm Is Angie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer. Hello? That's got a  a key down there. Oh. Oh.

Or put bits on your plate and then  just like put  this is a, I think this is a lime one. Mm! They taste a bit different actually to the ones we had. They don't like, used to have a little  . That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out.

You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no.

Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm.

It's a very good thing  That's right. if you've got  the money, sort of, the means to do it Well I think  then do. the bank pays and it  Yeah. comes out from  from  Ye  from my tax. Yeah. I do , I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health  in this kind, but to  know that you're covered rather  Yeah. than er Oh yeah. er ha , have problems  er er er, er when, when you  Definitely  require something. It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm.

For, you know, they all, all put them up. Well d'ya know what I haven't to your place yet, the, fireplace. I haven't put the  up. Oh yeah. Well you can do that before you go. I just hate lying, when you suddenly hear these things come down on, just have visions of like a  a  po pouring out. Yeah I, I, I think what it is, it probably needs a clean. Definitely. And er  I was gonna, er er, look up the thing. Don't, it doesn't work apparently. Cos Jim who was in there last year said it didn't work when he was there. Oh oh. So I don't, I don't know if it's  attached or  anything, I don't know. I'm not sure. I haven't been gassed yet anyway,so   I don't think any gas or anything's coming out. No. And you'll find your stuff's  staying there? No I kept a couple    of newspapers but er Well I've, I, I bought a stack with me in fact  It's . so, so, if I I know, I wondered why you brought the Gazette, I thought  strange!

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting. Give your apologies as you walk in   Well yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if  You know these, these , V P's V P's, yeah. sits down and says . So this time I was determined not to erm, get caught. And it's paid off. It was a, a nice place. Nice and sunny. Ba , I had  Yeah. lunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till  till quarter to two  erm  and then went back inside. But you, you sat outside for the best part of  quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, cos it was so sunny. And it was a  When the weather's nice it's just lovely, really nice  Oh it's beautiful! Yes. It's just  and it's so, it's like it was raining the other day when we went to go out  and just could not be bothered. It was really  Mm. pelting down. Oh it was when we were gonna go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no, I really cannot be bothered, it's just pouring down with rain, had to  Yeah. get the bus and I thought, oh er  so luckily Lisa sa , like they said, oh don't be silly we'll come and get you. So luckily, they like drove round and picked me up  Oh I see. and just brought me back again, which is fine. Right. But , just when you've got no transport and it's  Mm mm. pouring down with rain it's  it's just such an effort  to motivate yourself to get up to  Oh God! Yeah. It's like when we had no wa , like heating  or water, it was such an effort to  get yourself up  Yeah. to get ready to go out and the  Yeah. just, cold showers and stuff are like Oh bloody hell! not on my list of like  pleasurable er  No. things to do. Just like, no way! No I  I mean,we , I say, we sat out there and the peacocks are there  peahens. Oh yeah! Oh really? Mm mm. I see. I say, it i , it's nice, I mean, unless you  you really know about it  you have no idea at all. No. No idea. I suppose a lot of business might be done through word of mouth as well. Mm mm. If anything. The kind of thing you ought to do with  with mum is like, you could probably go down one Sunday and have a, have a, you know, have a lunch. It'll be Yeah. visit   It's not that far is it? Well it took us, as I say, an hour and a quarter. Pick me up on the way. Ha, ha, ha! Joke! I see , so we go round the M    twenty five, up to the M four    yes! Yes. Any minor detour. Any minor detour. There'll be convenient roadworks at Twickenham. I see.

And they said that er  yo , you're  you'll be war , the signs would  then, in fact, that er  there was a link up  Mm. with that. And until that I didn't reali  Oh I didn't realize he died cos  I, I, I, carried on smoking for a number of years after that. Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm. But basically that's because of  Well yes, the  his family, you know  family, yeah sure. Sure that's always outlet. sort of understand, yeah, something you've, you know, why he does it. Which is really sad. He's a really sweet guy . But erm Just thinks too much and smokes too much.

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

I take it we're leaving pretty quickly? No I, I had a feeling that I was gonna get landed with the bill there. Dear oh dear! It's the reason you came to see me. I thought it was a matter of going Dutch. I dunno. That's only on dates, you're my father. Is , oh oh. You  That doesn't count. Well let's see if I've got any money. My God! I think I paid it in. Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Ideally the subject should combine Ecology (with special reference to tropical rain-forests) with Protest (preferably shrill and futile). It should climax with an ecumenical prayer (in every known language simultaneously) for intergalactic peace. The musical material should include at least three of the following: Jewish cantillation, Catholic plainsong, Tibetan chanting, Aboriginal drumming, whalesong. The idiom should be middle-of-the-road, artfully diguised with mod cons (clusters, glissandi, electronics): there should be a strong pop-music element, plenty of repetition a la Philip Glass. When inspiration fails, fill the gaps with ritual gong-strokes, prolonged and amplified to the threshold of pain. But such cynicism will not do; this is a serious matter. A recent first visit to the USSR brought into focus for me the large question of evaluating music whose basis of appeal is grounded in extra-musical circumstances. The first problem is the dispassionate judgement of compositions that emerge from, and in some cases directly express, political oppression. The wide current appeal of such music seems to touch a nerve of communal masochism. Audiences yearn to groan under the yoke of suffering they may never have experienced. There is even a kind of envy for the depth of vision which this fate is thought to produce. The conspicuous case is Shostakovich, a composer of enormous gifts and awesome copiousness, the only one to satisfy, if intermittently, both his masters and the West. Ever since the \\u2018just criticism\\u2019 meted out to his early excesses, then the gigantic success of the Leningrad Symphony in the 1940s, he has symbolized the artist caught in the net of public events. As we now know something of the appalling story of his hounding by cultural officialdom, the raucous irony of the middle works and the bitter blackness of the last become entirely comprehensible. His is the only post-war body of symphonic and chamber music to achieve genuine popularity. Yet it is drastically imperfect. Impressive inspirations mix with the coarsest triteness; there is an inordinate amount of padding and bombast; the reliance on formulae is the most shameless since Telemann. Nor did things improve as he grew beyond subjection to state reproof. Some late works, notably the Fourteenth Symphony and the songs on Michaelangelo texts are among his greatest. But in the succession of late string quartets, poverty of substance and spiritual exhaustion are exemplified rather than expressed. Shostakovich, obviously pre-eminent among Soviet composers, had to bear the cruellest treatment. Bold spirits in the satellite countries were able to take liberties at home (Lutoslawski, Penderecki, Kurtag) when they didn't get away in person (Panufnik, Ligeti). The recent change of policy has unfrozen a flood of music by younger figures who have not undergone similar cultural repression, though the conditions of their work remain poignant and precarious. Recently it has been well-aired in this country through broadcasts and festivals; enough to form an initial overall view. I believe that music-lovers are deluded when they claim to find artistic pleasure in any but a fraction of this music. Here, as with most of Shostakovich, the content they locate is a projection of what they know of its circumstances -by which only a heart of stone would not be moved. Take away this knowledge and the appeal would vanish, for the music is rarely able to stand on its own merits. The second problem is the evaluation of new music that \\u2018deals\\u2019 with religious subject-matter, however vague. A nostalgia has become apparent, after an era of aggressive atheism, either for the great organized beliefs or for substitutes chiming better with the would-be freer spirit of the times. In the Sixties Gurus and pop music were the thing; the present mood is sombre and apocalyptic. In both, the identification with music that attempts to express any part of this vast area tends to be one of self-deceiving empathy. A spiritual void needs to be satisfied, so what is offered as serious and sacrosanct must be as good as it pretends. Instances would include the St Luke Passion by Penderecki and the St John by Arvo Part, Messiaen's Transfiguration, Britten's War Requiem. Tippett's Mask of Time and Birtwistle's Mask of Orpheus, Steve Reich's Desert Music, much of the output of John Tavener and Jonathan Harvey; above all, Stockhausen's seven-day wonder, Licht. Such religious/humanitarian subject-matter \\u2014 even the Holocaust, Hiroshima and Aids have not escaped \\u2014 makes a fortress as unassailable by criticism as the art produced under tyranny. The worth of individual pieces is, obviously, very various; consistent is the appeal to piety, ensuring that the elevated theme produces a warm-hearted response. These composers are not coldly exploiting their audiences' kindness; they are all equally the victims of the going ideology. And sincerity is not in question. But the hard truth, nailed with all-time accuracy by the other great composer from Leningrad (the one who got out) is that sincerity does not guarantee quality. \\u2018Most art is sincere,\\u2019 Stravinsky added, \\u2018and most art is bad\\u2019. Ersatz emotion replaces musical content. The genuine difficulty of understanding intricate artistic designs is evaded by the factitious difficulty of being exalted or troubled by important messages which have nothing to do with musical worth. Artistic value is not an \\u2018extra\\u2019 even in a threnody for Chernobyl. Without it, message or vision are wishful thinking. Audiences' large capacities for ersatz-importance show how eager they are to be deeply stirred; how easily gulled; how low the threshold of enjoyment must be set for music of our time. What little appeal it has seems to depend heavily on these impurities. No one would deny that music can embody great humane and religious themes. That it does so, so profoundly, is a vital part of what it is for. There is spiritual value in the very handling of its primary elements to write a little song or dance, even an exercise; even, as Bruckner used to show his classes, in a fifth or octave struck at a piano. The essence of music's higher flights is transcendental in the highest degree imaginable, in ways that are manifestly intelligible and effectual, and quite insusceptible to verbal accounting. Debussy's answer to a journalist who asked if he was familiar with heaven \\u2014\\u2018yes, but I don't natter about it with strangers\\u2019-is not so silly as it sounds. Evasive certainly, but only to acknowledge what cannot be uttered. The good composer expresses what he feels and makes what he is making, from an essentially musical motivation, by essentially musical means, with all the skill and experience he can command. The ends are various: here a visionary oratorio, there an opera buffa; here a craggy piano etude, there a melting morceau de salon. The degree of craft, the degree of inspiration, are the measure whereby they can be valued; through these are achieved, consciously or inadvertently, the heights and depths of spiritual expression whereby they are \\u2018a joy for ever\\u2019. Music can only be judged on the basis of an attentiveness to its musical essence as sensitive and discriminating as possible. Above all, as specific \\u2014 an undogmatic reaction to the details in style and technique of the particular composer, piece, or passage. Naturally this will include transcendental subject-matter if it's there, and recognize the moments where this sweeps all before it. All the rest is emotional blackmail. RECORD REVIEWS /Violent measure: Shostakovich: Piano Concerto No 1, Chamber Symphony, Seven Preludes Op 34. Evgeny Kissin (piano), Moscow Virtuosi. Vladimir Spivakov. RCA Victor RD87947 Rachmaninov: Preludes Op 32. Shostakovich: Piano Sonata No 1. Lilya Zilberstein (piano). DG427766-2 By SIMON MUNDY IT IS 14 years since Shostakovich died. Nonetheless his reputation as at once the most searching and accessible of contemporary composers has not diminished. If anything, fashion is moving closer to the context of his style with the passage of time. In the 1970s his language did indeed seem a little old-fashioned. Now, as composers grope towards a language that satisfies audiences and yet manages to be sufficiently modern, Shostakovich's music sounds at the front once again. There has been a welcome pile of new recordings issued recently; not just of the symphonies, but of the concertos and chamber music as well. Two of them mark the start of international recording careers for extraordinary young Soviet pianists, Evgeny Kissin and Lilya Zilberstein, who were only children when Shostakovich died. Kissin, aged 18, came to prominence a couple of years ago when he appeared to great acclaim at the Berlin Festival. His recording of the First Piano Concerto is sparklingly assured \\u2014 crisply articulated but with enough sensitivity to convey the inevitable bitter-sweet character of the slow movement. This is anyway a stunning disc, thanks to the playing of the Moscow Virtuosi with Spivakov. Their performances of the orchestral arrangements \\u2014 the Chamber Symphony (arranged by Rudolph Barshai from the Eighth Quartet) and the Opus 34 Preludes (arranged by Victor Poltoratsky from the piano original) are superbly polished. Lilya Zilberstein, at 24, is also an impressive discovery. Her first record shows her to be as musical as she is technically accomplished. The pithy violence of Shostakovich's First Sonata does not come naturally to her, but she is at home in the limpid impressionism of Rachmaninov's G major Prelude, which on its own makes this disc worth having. The lyrical and passionate aspects of Shostakovich, rather than the bitterly satirical, also bring out the best in Julian Lloyd Webber's playing. His elegiac tempo for the largo of the Cello Sonata allows him a sustained outpouring of feeling. John McCabe's accompanying, too, is wonderfully supportive. The Sonata is imaginatively coupled with Britten's, written after his first meeting with Shostakovich in 1961. The usual characters of the two composers are reversed here; there is little of the English scene-painter in Britten's Sonata, and it stands as one of his most nervous and angry works. Lloyd Webber and McCabe, both amiable men, sense the unease and respond to it deftly. Itzhak Perlman's account of Shostakovich's First Violin Concerto is a more rough-hewn affair. Perlman is usually the slickest of violinists, but here he seems to cultivate a rasping sound that emphasises the work's macabre portrait of Stalin's Russia in the late 1940s. This, along with the concerto by Shostakovich's teacher Glazunov, was recorded live in Tel Aviv in July 1988 so there is a spate of clapping at the end. But the acoustic captured by the engineers is reasonably spacious. I have reservations about Perlman and Mehta's treatment of the Glazunov, though, which seems neither as richly romantic as Oscar Shumsky's on Chandos, nor as glittering as Anne-Sophie Mutter's on Erato: the other two versions to appear in the last year. In this silkiest of works there needs to be an elegant bonhomie, mixed with a hint of gentle sadness, which quite eludes the Israel PO and the soloist, who seem intent on squeezing out each last drip of sentiment \\u2014 surely a misunderstanding of the composer's style and aspirations. MUSIC /Enlightened views: OAE /Mackerras \\u2014 Queen Elizabeth Hall By TESS KNIGHTON HAYDN-LOVERS are in for a good time this autumn: coming up are the Haydn at Esterhaza concerts at the Wigmore Hall (part of the Magyarok Britain Salutes Hungary Festival); already on display is the Haydn and England exhibition at the British Library; and just started is the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment's QEH Haydn series concentrating on his late choral works. The opening concert \\u2014 a performance of The Creation, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras \\u2014 sets a high standard for the remaining seven concerts in the series. The ingredients were just right: three highly intelligent soloists (Lynne Dawson, Anthony Rolfe Johnson and David Wilson-Johnson); a small but alert choir (excellently trained by Julian Clarkson); a top-name period-instrument orchestra; and a conductor not afraid to cherish every aspect of Haydn's extraordinary score. This was music-making of a high order. Mackerras's account was compassionate but redblooded, direct but full of charm. It did not set out to be radically different, though Haydn's colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments (including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a bass line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoon), but it succeeded in being unforced and unfettered. He made the most of his superb wind section, used the extra clarity of the strings to underline the richness of the harmony, and encouraged the brass to cut through the texture and pin down the rhythm as, for example, in the exhilarating chorus \\u2018Achieved is the Glorious Work\\u2019. The audiences at the first performances of The Creation in Vienna in the late 1790s were entranced by Haydn's musical depictions of every living creature from the mighty eagle to the lowly worm. Only a short while later these were accused (by Schiller amongst others) of being not worthy of him -\\u2018Fit only for the nursery, to use in connection with Noah's Ark\\u2019\\u2014 but the truth is they are irresistible. Lynne Dawson's clear voice soared and trilled through \\u2018The Birds\\u2019 number, while Wilson-Johnson's worm was creepily sinuous. This was an uplifting experience \\u2014 as Haydn intended it should be. Days Like These By IAN IRVINE 10 October, 1903 RAYMOND ASQUITH writes to Lady Manners from Aberdeenshire: \\u2018We had a storm yesterday and went out to watch the waves: I ventured too far out onto a rock and was knocked flat on my face against a granite floor by one of the biggest rollers ever seen on this coast: I never felt such a blow; luckily I fell in a crevice and wasn't washed away; but I was stunned for a few seconds, and when I got up my face and knee were streaming with blood. Margot is always splendid on these occasions; she took me back to the house and covered me with ice and raw beef: but in spite of all I am a most revolting sight today and shall be for a week or more \\u2014 lame in one leg, blind in one eye, and with a nose like Cyrano\\u2026 I'm glad you can't see me: you would never speak to me again.\\u2019 10 October, 1979 STEPHEN SPENDER, teaching in Lynchburg, Virginia, writes in his journal: \\u2018My class, which I took last night, seems irremediable. I have really almost given up trying to discuss their poems, and just talk about poetry. In one of the poems were the following lines: I seem as though from a polished ship Torn Between the anchors at the dock And the currents of the sea. \\u2018This doesn't work. You can't think of a ship as having an emotional life divided between the attachment to its anchors and the call of the tides,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018She personalizes the ship,\\u2019 a friend of the poetess said, in a just audible squeak. \\u2018Well, even if the ship was you \\u2014 I mean \\u2014 if you were the ship \\u2014 it would be absurd,\\u2019 I argued, beginning to feel dizzy. However I could see that the class was against me. Crushed ambitions and women's lib feelings had rallied to the author's right to identify herself with a polished ship. \\u2018When I got back to my apartment I ate some ham and beans, and opened a bottle of rather rust-coloured claret. I ate too much and drank nearly three-quarters of the bottle. I felt disgusted with myself, repelled by my heavy, unlovable weight of flesh.\\u2019 14 October, 1969 TONY BENN records in his diary: \\u2018In the evening Caroline and I went to Number 10 for a dinner for the American astronauts, the first three men to have been on the moon. Neil Armstrong and Buz Aldrin and their wives were there and Harold had laid on the evening in grand style with lots of television coverage. I sat next to Pat Collins who is a very intelligent and delightful woman. I felt sorry that she had George Brown, completely pickled, on the other side of her.\\u2019 TELEVISION /He knew what he liked By THOMAS SUTCLIFFE AN OBJECT lesson for all those who bemoan the artistic indifference of government, last night's Omnibus (BBC 1) looked at a political leader who took the closest interest in art, a mediocre and embittered water-colourist who eventually turned to another medium \\u2014 mass emotion and warfare. \\u2018The Fuhrer loves art because he is himself an artist,\\u2019 Goebbels announced in a contemporary newsreel, at which, no doubt, all genuine artists looked uneasily towards the border. This is still not an easy subject-matter \\u2014 when the Royal Academy put together its recent retrospective of \\u2018German Art in the Twentieth-Century\\u2019 it dealt with the Nazi years by ignoring them altogether \\u2014 a decision that put it in line with the orthodox view of the work's quality and conveniently avoided the embarrassing possibility that these works \\u2014 kitsch, sunlit expressions of heroic physical vigour and serene landscape \\u2014 might still prove more popular than German expressionism. Omnibus's simplistic script favoured show-and-tell over analysis but that dangerous moral \\u2014 that these years were a triumph of popular taste in art, not a suppression of it \\u2014 could be glimpsed now and then. \\u2018The Nazis didn't invent styles\\u2019, the narration pointed out, \\u2018they occupied those that already existed\\u2019. In some cases this was rather literally the case \\u2014 the syrupy domestic interiors beloved of German nineteenth-century painters began to reappear with pictures of the Fuhrer on the wall and the Volkischer Beobachter lying folded on the table. Elsewhere the co-option was more subtle; the addition of the word \\u2018German\\u2019 to a landscape painting would usually guarantee its success. Omnibus chronicled all this with exemplary thoroughness but finally elided the real aesthetic questions \\u2014 of a battle between art that invites the viewer to think and art that passes through the mind leaving only a sugary trace of complacent pleasure. \\u2018Aesthetic judgements are impossible\\u2019, the narration concluded, a denial which implied that paintings are only as good or bad as the political opinions of those that paint them. Earlier we had been told that some \\u2018lascivious\\u2019 nudes were \\u2018a sign of increasing decadence at the centre of an inflexible regime\\u2019, a phrase with some deeply troubling echoes of vocabulary. That this film, of all films, was prepared to judge paintings merely as symptoms of moral decay, was a little startling. MUSICALS /Bows of Holly: Mark Steyn reviews London's latest musical biography, Buddy, at The Victoria Palace By MARK STEYN THE TEXANS drawl \\u2018Y'all\\u2019, blacks go \\u2018Yo\\u2019, Hispanics leer \\u2018Hey, ameeeeeeeego!\\u2019. And towering above these stage cliches is, of course, the driven genius whose music cannot be stemmed by the forces of reaction. Who is it this time? Wagner, Glenn Miller, Jason Donovan? No matter; only the accents change \\u2014 and the pants: here, the squares wear slacks, the good guys blue-jeans. Warned not to sing rock'n'roll on a c&w station, Buddy Holly insists, \\u2018I gotta play ma music.\\u2019 Misunderstood by Decca Records, he maintains, \\u2018I wanna play ma music ma way.\\u2019 Even when the hits start, he's not content. \\u2018We gotta take our music more serious,\\u2019 he tells the Crickets, who remain unconvinced. \\u2018You got money, you got fame,\\u2019 he pleads, \\u2018what you want to booze for?\\u2019 Booze? We're midway through Act II and a solitary six-pack has yet to hove into view. But this is a plot development \\u2014 the plot development \\u2014 and, if it involves turning a couple of Aled Jones types into Oliver Reeds, why let logic get in the way? As it happens, there is a kind of logic behind Buddy. The most common reason for a biomusical is opportunism: take a star like Judy Garland or John Lennon, and you pick up a hit title and a hit score ready-made. Now, Alan Janes's play matches the well-loved songs with equally well-loved dialogue in a K-Tel Golden Greats collection of Dramatists' Reliables. Choke up at The Price Of Fame: \\u2018I give \\u2018em everything and they stick a knife in my back.\\u2019 Fight back those tears at The Inevitable Parting: \\u2018You and me, boy, I reckon we've come to the end of our road.\\u2019 Marvel at The Little Woman Behind The Man: \\u2018I'd like to sing a song fer a special girlfriend who's kinda important to me.\\u2019 The justification for this is authenticity. \\u2018All that happens in the play is based on fact,\\u2019 Janes pledges solemnly in the programme notes. \\u2018As we know, truth is often stranger than fiction.\\u2019 Often? Most of us prefer to watch Dallas than our neighbours' home-movies, because, when it comes down to it, we know that truth is generally a lot duller than fiction. Occasionally, though, a dramatist will uncover someone with an interesting story, regardless of how unknown or vaguely remembered the subject is. How many of us can now recall the real Maria von Trapp or Fanny Brice? They live only through The Sound Of Music and Funny Girl. Buddy Holly comes somewhere between the subjects of those and more parasitic biographies. His records are still played, but his personality, unexposed through movies or extensive TV interviews, is almost entirely unknown. It is, in theory, the best of both worlds \\u2014 except that Buddy Holly, by all accounts, was not terribly interesting. He was born in Lubbock, married a nice Spanish girl and died young in a \\u2018plane crash in 1959. All that counts are the records, a rhythmically unusual Tex-Mex fusion of rock'n'roll and older western elements, pioneering what became the standard pop instrumentation of two guitars, bass and drums. The lyrics are another matter. Of the two prototype rock songwriters, it's the more worldly Chuck Berry you turn to for the authentic picture of teenage pleasures in Eisenhower's America: \\u2018Gonna write a little letter, Gonna mail it to my local deejay.\\u2019 Or: \\u2018Cruising and playing the radio With no particular place to go.\\u2019 Berry's songs are plausible emblems of rock'n'roll rebellion or, at any rate, youthful hedonism. Buddy invites us to regard Holly in the same light, mocking (in a horribly nudging re-creation) Lubbock old-timers like The Hayriders, who sing: \\u2018When the sun goes down on Blue Ridge Mountain It's the time to whistle in your ear.\\u2019 At least, this has a surreal daftness. The voice of rock'n'roll, in contrast, is almost unrelievedly soupy. If you didn't know the tunes, you'd assume Holly's lyrics decorated some innocent backporch spooners from the turn-of-the-century: \\u2018Stars appear and the shadows are fallin' You can hear my honey callin'.\\u2019 Or: \\u2018You give me all your lovin' And your turtle-dovin'.\\u2019 Or: \\u2018When Cupid shot his dart He shot it at your heart.\\u2019 Not only are these songs impossible to use dramatically, they're also too vague to use as incidental music, to underline or punctuate aspects of Holly's life or the 1950s more generally. \\u2018I wrote it for you,\\u2019 he assures his gal before the ballads, but how can you tell? All you can do with these songs is sing them, and Buddy fails even to manage that with any subtlety. The finales to both Acts are effectively concerts, the sort of agreeably naff rock'n'roll revival that might just about pass muster as a Capital Gold one-nighter down the Hammersmith Palais. And, for all the appeal of his singing and playing, Paul Hipp comes out pretty dull between the numbers. To camouflage the failures of the play, Andy Walmsley has created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoardings: Oldsmobile, Van Heusen shirts, Texaco Premium Type. Rob Bettinson, the director, has deduced that he ought to have these images plus disc-jockeys, radio commercials, midwestern hops, but he doesn't seem to know why. Like most shows which are manufactured with an eye to commercial success (Winnie, High Society, to name only Buddy's predecessors at the Victoria Palace), this one will probably fail. It's not as if there aren't aspects of his career that aren't worth exploring: how did he come to use drums, then almost unknown in Texan country line-ups? Was it true, as the chart performance of \\u2018Heartbeat\\u2019(his last release) suggests, that his three-year career was already on the wane? And surely any dramatist ought to be able to move us with that final night of Holly's life, when his musicians (including Waylon Jennings) gave their places on the \\u2018plane to the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens. The author's job is not merely to offer an illustrated Who's Who entry, but to turn elements of a man's life into a dramatic entity. And, if Holly's too boring for that, perhaps the best approach would be to write about his impact on others.

THEATRE /More than their jobs are worth: Peter Kemp on Roger Hall's Roll On Friday at the Palace, Watford By PETER KEMP The play Roll On Friday is one that very soon has you echoing its title's wish that time would pass more rapidly. In its attempt to satirise an institution supposedly dominated by tedium, repetition and pointlessness, it perversely contrives to consist of little but these things itself. The setting is Room 133: the stores branch of a vast government department in Wellington, New Zealand. Into this cluttered little office \\u2014 on a wet and windswept Monday morning in 1974 \\u2014 burst five of its personnel. In accordance with the procedures governing Roger Hall's comedy, they do so at regularly-spaced intervals, each entering with a gasp and clad in a ridiculous profusion of scarves, hats and rainwear, so that his droll point about the awfulness of the country's climate can be adequately appreciated. It is usual in this office comedy, you quickly discover, for jokes to be transmitted at least in triplicate. Often, the same bit of flimsy facetiousness gets disgorged with a frequency that suggests the whole thing is a product of some mechanically chortling Xerox machine. Every 20 minutes or so, the play guffawingly alludes to the non-arrival of some long-ordered calculators. When they finally appear, they turn out \\u2014 in what for this play amounts to a considerable comic twist \\u2014 to have been fitted with the wrong plug. As a human variant on such running \\u2014 or lumbering \\u2014 gags, there is Wally, a farcically uncooperative caretaker who puts in a regulation grumpy appearance in each of the play's four scenes in order to enunciate his catchphrase, \\u2018Nothing to do with me\\u2019. Much of the play's humour comes straight from stock. There are jests about administrative gaffes ('overtrousers' mistyped as \\u2018overt rousers\\u2019) or about the craziness of bureaucracy (the staff have no order forms because they have run out of order forms with which to order them). Traditional sniggerings are amply catered for, too. The office's tubby female employee is the constant butt of lines like: \\u2018Of course you're not fat, Beryl\\u2026pull up a couple of chairs and sit down.\\u2019 'Mind my yoghurt', she squeals when a workmate squeezes her breasts. A further dismal feature of the evening is Hall's penchant for the unsurprising surprise. Predictably, a much-mentioned colleague absent on sick-leave gets the job two of the characters on stage are rivals for. Lumps of pathos intermittently introduce a note of sentiment into all of this. Two of the men turn out to have family problems. Plump Beryl who talks to the office cactus is lovelorn, it is revealed. The awkward changes of tone caused by these disclosures are managed with some skill by the Watford cast, all of whom also do their impressive best to polish up the lustreless comic lines they are lumbered with. In particular, Simon Slater as the sarky office cad and Annette Badland as Beryl put in performances far above the level of the sitcom script. Made up of four 30-minute scenes, in each of which the same people say and do the same things in the same setting, Roll On Friday, it is no surprise to learn, has been developed into a five-year television series in New Zealand and Australia. The only way in which it even faintly stirs your brain cells is in causing you to wonder what on earth it's doing on the stage at Watford. THEATRE /Dunsinane via Bali: Macbeth \\u2014 Marlowe, Canterbury By ALEX RENTON ACTORS have researched Shakespeare in prisons, zoos, hospitals: David Garrick constructed his Lear in a lunatic asylum, studying an old man who had managed to drop his daughter out of a window. Rather more fun and doubtless just as fruitful was the Odyssey Theatre Company's research for their Macbeth: six weeks spent with the support of the Scottish Arts Council on the Indonesian island of Bali. The official justification is that in Bali the company could work with local performers and learn to \\u2018shift our centres of gravity away from the head, down into the centres of our bodies\\u2019. On stage this is translated into the uncomfortable standing squat familiar from karate movies: knees splayed and bottom out. In Bali, we are also told, life can be spent among people who daily interact with the forces of good and evil in nature. This is the only really objectionable thing about Odyssey's odyssey; a daily communion with good and evil is not in any way the experience of the characters in Macbeth. The intervention is extraordinary, and to think of it otherwise risks ignoring how the interest of the play lies in the psychological, in the testing of our sympathy and understanding of the Macbeths. We get little of that. Instead there is a designer's travelogue: the production (no director is listed, but Nigel Jamieson heads the company) veers all over the Far East and indeed round to the Caribbean. It sports an instructor in kabuki, and much seems Japanese: the costumes, the men's top-knots and a fair part of the staging seem to come from Kurosawa. For the domestic scenes \\u2014 and these include the most moving Slaughter of the Macduffs sequence I have seen \\u2014 we come right back to European naturalism. There are many other good things in the production, a passionate and gripping Lady Macbeth from Clare Benedict; witches dressed to look like maggots; and fight scenes that presumably use the Balinese experience in becoming savage death dances. The music, using Gamelan instruments, is a pleasure, though it can occasionally obscure the text. Focus is often concentrated on the young, and on Emma Bernard who plays both Fleance and Macbeth's son. At the play's opening she stands centre stage, silent in a white shift, until a stab brings red cascading from her belly. The point seems to be that Macbeth's greatest crime is in tampering with the future. But, as so often when a design idea takes over a production, an awful lot gets missed. The text has been cut quite wantonly and only for expediency, you feel. Ian Halcrow's Macbeth looks great but never draws us close, and he and others swallow or truncate their lines as though they cared very little for them. This, according to the programme, is Kechak, a Balinese vocal technique involving \\u2018complex cross-rhythms and syncopations\\u2019. The talents of this company are obvious: it will be interesting to see what they do next, especially if the research happens at home, in London.\",\n          \"What is the use of going to open beaches when we must return to segregated residential areas and schools and suffer under the laws that make the best medical treatment the prerogative of the whites only in our country?

ANC radio, Addis Ababa, November 17 (BBC monitoring) Obituary Rene Muawad. Controversial conciliator:. LEBANESE President Rene Muawad, killed in a car bomb assassination on Wednesday, was a conciliator who tried to restore Lebanese peace and unity after 14 years of civil war. He was 64. He was murdered one day after he told Lebanese, on the eve of their 46th independence anniversary, that their divided country was close to peace. In the short period since his election by Parliament on November 5, Muawad tried in vain to spread his government's hold beyond Syrian-controlled regions and a part of the Christian enclave north of Beirut. Muawad was elected during a Parliament session held at an air base in northern Lebanon. The election was part of an Arab League-sponsored peace plan. But he immediately faced opposition from a fellow Maronite, the Christian army commander Gen Michel Aoun, who denounced Muawad as a Syrian puppet and claimed his election was unconstitutional. Muawad had been a member of the 99-seat Parliament since he was elected to represent his home region in 1957 at age 32. An early advocate of national reconciliation, Muawad had taken part in the 20-member \\u2018national dialogue committee\\u2019 formed in September 1975 to find a settlement to the civil war, then five months old. The Muawad family, and the Issa Khoury clan to which his wife Naila belongs, are allied with the powerful Franjiehs in the northeastern region. The Franjiehs, who have their own Marada, or Giants, militia, are headed by former president Suleiman Franjieh, one of the last of the old-style Maronite warlords. Muawad graduated from the French-affilated St. Joseph University in Christian east Beirut with a law degree in 1947. He started his own practice in the northern provincial capital of Tripoli two years later, but gave it up when he entered Parliament. But Muawad spent his first year in Parliament as an exile in the Syrian port city of Lattakia, after a member of a rival family accused him of taking part in an inter-clan clash in June 1957 near Zghotra in which 16 people were killed. The House refused demands it stripped Muawad of his parliamentary immunity. He returned to Lebanon in 1958, shortly after newly elected President Fuad Chahab dropped charges against him for \\u2018lack of undisputed evidence.\\u2019 Later, the witness who had testified against Muawad withdrew his allegation, saying it was \\u2018politically motivated.\\u2019 Muawad was Minister of Telegraphs and Telecommunications from 1961. He was named Minister of Public Works in 1969 and Minister of Education in 1980. While he held the Education Portfolio, Muawad sliced through sectarian hatreds to organise school examinations for Christian and Moslem youngsters whose studies had been interrupted by the war. Muawad married Nayla Khoury on Feb. 11, 1965. They have a daughter, Rima, 22, and a son, Michel, 17. Muawad (right) meeting the Soviet Ambassador this month The Russians are coming Faced with social turbulence and resurgent anti-Semitism, many thousands of Soviet Jews are emigrating to their spiritual home. Ian Black in Tel Aviv asks whether Israel, willing but hardly prepared for the influx, can cope. VALERY and Ina and their children were visibly tired as they traipsed into the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption reception hall at Ben Gurion Airport. It had been a long, slow journey from Odessa and although it was already 1am there were still many more official forms to fill out before their new life in Israel could begin. Victoria, aged 12, made a beeline for the reconstituted orange juice and sandwiches prepared by a pair of stout volunteer ladies who arrived from Russia themselves a few years back, and two-year-old Oleg was soon roaring about wildly on a plastic fire-engine in the playroom. There were about 100 of them on Sunday's evening flight from Bucharest to Tel Aviv, unmistakably Soviet with their fur hats, cheap wintry clothes and suitcases and quiet, mechanical submission to the first taste of Israeli bureaucracy. Fair-haired Jews from Moscow and Leningrad mingled with olive-skinned Georgians to read the Cyrillic slogans welcoming them and then sank down in rows of plastic chairs or gazed at the panoramic photograph of Jerusalem covering an entire wall. A toothless old man from Baku, his double-breasted jacket beribboned with the medals of two world wars, looked dazed. At 93, little remained of the liturgical Hebrew he had studied before the October Revolution, but he was pleased to be leaving his quarrelsome Armenian and Azerbaijani neighbours behind. Dimitri Bogakovsky, a 36-year-old doctor from Kiev, was radiantly happy. \\u2018I feel I have come home,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I'm only sorry I didn't come to Israel 20 years ago.\\u2019 Ina, a teacher, was more cautious. \\u2018At the moment I can say I wanted to come here and not to America,\\u2019 she smiled. \\u2018What I'll be saying in a year's time I don't know.\\u2019 Several flights like these, some from Budapest and Vienna, are now arriving at Ben Gurion every week, their human cargoes eloquent testimony to the swelling numbers of Soviet Jewish emigrants and the vast changes that Mikhail Gorbachev's policies have wrought in their homeland. Economic and political uncertainty and the rise of truculent local nationalisms from the Baltic to the Caspian have raised the ancient spectre of anti-Semitism, never far below the surface of Soviet life. Under glasnost and perestroika, the last great untapped pool of world Jewry is on the move. Exact numbers are unavailable: 2.5 to three million is the accepted figure, though 70 years of cultural and religious suppression, intermarriage and assimilation means that the real number \\u2014 in Zionist terms those who qualify for automatic Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return \\u2014 may be far higher. Turbulence at home, combined with an American decision to restrict Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union, mean that the stream of emigration is now directed almost exclusively at Israel. The challenge is immense, and no one is sure whether it can be met. According to the latest projections, 100,000 Soviet Jews will arrive in Israel over the next three years, and the numbers may be even higher if and when direct flights start from Moscow to Tel Aviv, the most important tangible sign of the rapid thaw in Soviet-Israeli relations. In comparative terms, such an influx is the equivalent of the movement of three million East Germans to West Germany, a country (unlike Israel) with a healthy economy where difficulties of acclimatization for the newcomers will be at a minimum and language problems non-existent. If the Russians do arrive on this scale it will be the largest single wave of what Israelis call aliya (literally \\u2018ascent\\u2019) since the immediate post independence years in the early 1950s, a heady return to the heart of the Zionist idea at a time when the country \\u2014 still fighting the Palestinian uprising, on a permanent war footing and its economy slipping into recession \\u2014 is far from ready. THE FIRST big wave of Russians came after the 1967 war, when Zionist feelings were awakened by Israel's six day victory and Soviet support for the Arabs. Moscow underestimated the phenomenon, believing that if the hard core of \\u2018provocateurs\\u2019 were allowed to emigrate the vast majority would stay. The emigration movement reached a peak in 1973 with 33,000 Jews leaving. It dipped after the Yom Kippur war, rising again to 51,000 in 1979. Until 1982 figures dropped steadily again, reaching a low point in 1986. Even in the good years Israel had only a share. Between 1968 and 1988 280,000 Jews emigrated, but only 165,000 came to Israel. In 1988 the drop-out rate reached a staggering 92 per cent. But in the first 10 months of 1989 alone over 7,000 have arrived, and there are expected to be 10,000 by the end of the year. The new wave is not in the heroic mould of famous \\u2018refuseniks\\u2019 like Anatoly Scharansky, Ida Nudel and Josef Begun, who finally arrived in Israel after years of persecution, exile and imprisonment. Few of the newcomers know any Hebrew and few have more than the vaguest idea about Israel. Many would have preferred America. With the Berlin Wall, the most famous barrier of all, falling, the more media-conscious activists among the Soviet Jews already here are warning that Israel is just not prepared for the influx. \\u2018Israel's lack of preparedness for mass Soviet Jewish immigration is psychologically understandable but not politically forgivable,\\u2019 says Yuri Stern, a Muscovite who came in 1981. \\u2018Its very difficult to appreciate a revolution, to see today as really qualitatively, dramatically different from the day before. Its difficult to go beyond normal scepticism and see this huge number not just as a potential but as a reality.\\u2019 Israelis are pleased with the change in the US regulations, which effectively signal an end to the drop-out phenomenon. \\u2018Israel,\\u2019 says one senior official, \\u2018has never been interested in emigration as such, but in aliya \\u2014 in having as many Jews as possible come to Israel.\\u2019 In this perspective, places like the Ladispoli transit camp near Rome, where thousands of Soviet Jews are still awaiting visas to the US, are a disgrace. A thriving Jewish life in New York's Brighton Beach will not reinforce Israel. Freedom of choice is no longer on the agenda, especially now that American Jews have discovered that it is easier to raise money for absorbing Soviet Jews in Israel than it is for resettling them in the US. The Israeli government has been agonisingly slow to take up the challenge, although it has calculated that US$3 billion will be needed over three years for housing, job creation and other aspects of large-scale immigrant absorption. The bureaucracy certainly needs streamlining: the immigrants are met initially by the Absorption Ministry, but once in the country many of their needs are looked after by the Jewish Agency, the semi-private organisation that dates back to the early years of Jewish settlement in Palestine. The two bodies are often at loggerheads, and there are constant disputes over methods: are the newcomers best served by direct absorption \\u2014 being given money and subsidies for their first year and then left to cope on their own, or by being placed in one of the 38 Jewish Agency absorption centres. LEARNING Hebrew is a priority for all, and places in the famous ulpan system are available at once. But even after six months of intensive study many other problems remain. A Soviet engineer who lost his job a decade ago after applying to emigrate needs to catch up. Doctors need to retrain for eight months. At the big Mevasseret absorption centre near Jerusalem, where there are 77 Russian families in different stages of acclimatization, only half the breadwinners are working. Unskilled workers tend to do better than the professionals, enjoying the advantages of a free market for the first time in their lives. On the positive side, the changes inside the Soviet Union will help: with the unprecedented flowering of Jewish cultural freedom, Hebrew classes are now a possibility; potential immigrants can now learn more about Israel before they come. Another innovation is the stream of Jewish tourists visiting Israel from Russia: 25,000 have been since 1988, and the Jewish Agency sees this is a uniquely helpful way to win hearts and minds. Forty thousand are expected next year. The new arrivals, like their predecessors, tend towards the right of the political spectrum. \\u2018Of course we thought about political problems, but everyone in Israel suffers from the same ones,\\u2019 says Igor, a railway engineer studying at the Mevasseret ulpan. \\u2018I'm content to go into the army, and I'm definitely against giving up territory to the Arabs.\\u2019 The veterans are pleased, but accept that the newcomers are coming here less out of choice than of necessity. Haim Scheider, an economist who left Lithuania 10 years ago, has been unemployed for 18 months, but still has no regrets. He visited his former homeland last summer and couldn't bear it. \\u2018You make comparisons all the time and the comparison is in Israel's favour, there's no doubt about it. People have achieved things here that they coudn't do in Russia, not even in their wildest dreams.\\u2019 Haim, who speaks halting Hebrew with a heavy accent, still leads an intensely Russian life in the new West Bank settlement north of Jerusalem where he lives with his wife and two children. \\u2018My son is already an Israeli,\\u2019 he laughs, \\u2018he prefers humus and felafel to gefilte fish.\\u2019 Difficulties abound, but it seems that the Russians are coming anyway. \\u2018In times of emergency we behave differently from normal times,\\u2019 says Meir Edlestein, the director of the Mevasseret absorption centre. \\u2018This is a very Zionist answer.\\u2019 More practical answers will have to be provided as the Jews pour in, huddled on the platform of rapidly changing history, anxious to change their lives in an imperfect world. \\u2018The marriage between Soviet Jews and Israel is a marriage that is probably going to happen,\\u2019 argues Yuri Stern, \\u2018whether or not the bride and groom feel they are really ready for it.\\u2019 And did those feet\\u2026predecessors of the new wave of Soviet Jews walking to Palestine in the 1930sPHOTOGRAPH: BBC HULTON PICTURE LIBRARY corrections page 19\",\n          \"The main speaker will be Cefin Campbell, director of Menter Cwm Gwendraeth, set up in Dyfed in 1989.

COUPLE'S LITHUANIA MERCY DASH School helps with aid project for hospital children By Ian Lang Daily Post Staff A CLWYD school has come to the aid of project to bring help to children at a Lithuanian hospital. Ron and Pat Woolley, of Rhyl, recently took a huge lorry-load of medical supplies, equipment and clothes to the Klaipicla Children's Hospital in Lithuania after being shocked by the conditions they found there during a previous visit. The hospital's situation was so desperate that there was only one small bag of drugs to share between 300 sick children. The couple launched an appeal which evoked a generous response from organisations, companies and individuals. Although the couple's mercy dash has meant conditions have improved and lives have been saved, the hospital's problems are not yet over. During their visit they took a video camera with the intention of making a short film to show what conditions are really like. However, they needed help to make the film clearer. In stepped pupils from Ysgol ap Iwan, Abergele, who used special facilities available at the school to do the job. They are also helping the couple in making a collage of the many photographs they took. \\u2018The students have done a marvellous job for us. Having a film to show is vital to help us get the message across,\\u2019 said Mrs Woolley.

MP to rescue over benefit hearings By Ian Lang Daily Post Staff PEOPLE on benefits in the Rhyl and Kinmel Bay area unhappy at having to travel to Wrexham to sort out grievances have been helped by their MP. Clwyd North West MP, Rod Richards, became concerned over complaints from constituents that they had to travel all the way to Wrexham for benefit agency tribunal hearings. \\u2018Many of those who made the journey suffered from physical disabilities and the distances involved caused them great hardship and discomfort,\\u2019 he said. Mr Richards said he approached the Independent Tribunal Appeals Services in Nottingham, and as a result residents of Kinmel Bay and Rhyl would now have their cases heard in Colwyn Bay, reducing travelling time from around 50 minutes to 15 minutes. Trident revolt fear by Tories MINISTERS were warned yesterday of \\u2018horrendous implications\\u2019 if the lucrative contract to refit Trident nuclear submarines was awarded to Devonport dockyard instead of Rosyth in Fife. The Government could be heading for a damaging backbench revolt of Scottish Tories if it rejects Rosyth. Even though the Ministry of Defence insists no decision has been reached, MPs North of the border suspect that Devonport in Plymouth is now favoured. Already Scottish Tory Mps are lining up to threaten the Government that they will withhold support or even vote against if Rosyth is forsaken. Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, MP for Perth and Kinross, warned: \\u2018I would certainly vote against the Government. Such a move would ruin the economy of the whole central belt of Scotland. \\u2018Rosyth is hands-down better than Devonport for safety, development and everything else. It would be madness to pick Devonport.\\u2019 Implications Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North, said the political implications of rejecting Rosyth were \\u2018far more horrendous than they are in the South West.\\u2019 He stressed that a 5pc voting swing against the Tories in the South West would reduce their MP numbers there from 16 to 10. \\u2018In Scotland, a 5pc swing against the Conservatives would reduce our numbers from 11 to two and that would make it virtually impossible for a Conservative Government to govern in Scotland.\\u2019 Many MPs suspect no announcement on the decision will be made until the last day before the summer recess to avoid a Parliamentary row. Devonport's chances are thought to have increased following the Tories' disastrous performance in last month's local elections in the South West. But Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for North-East Fife, warned: \\u2018If the submarine refit goes to Devonport and not Rosyth, the Tory Party in Scotland might as well go into receivership.\\u2019 Talks agreed on 2m-strong \\u2018super union\\u2019 merger A POSSIBLE merger between two of Britain's biggest unions moved a step closer yesterday, with a \\u2018historic decision\\u2019 to open talks. Delegates in Portsmouth for the annual conference of the GMB union overwhelmingly agreed to start preliminary discussions with the Transport and General Workers' Union. A possible amalgamation, which would form a two million-strong \\u2018super\\u2019 union, will now be discussed at the T&GWU's annual conference next month. GMB general secretary John Edmonds said: \\u2018This is a matter of enormous significance in the union movement.\\u2019 An amalgamation between two unions with huge resources could be a way of attracting more union members, he believed. Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, said: \\u2018The outcome is very encouraging for both unions.\\u2019 Call for action on cover at hospital By Ian Lang Daily Post Staff HEALTH watchdogs in Aberconwy are stepping up their pressure on Gwynedd Health Authority to ensure there is adequate weekend and night-time anaesthetic cover at Llandudno Hospital. Earlier this year Aberconwy Community Health Council called for urgent action to tackle the situation. They say that cover is presently provided from Ysbyty Gwynedd at Bangor, but are concerned that delays in getting to Llandudno could prove potentially serious. The health authority say a consultant anaesthetist living in Colwyn Bay is available. But the health watchdogs have countered that one person cannot be expected to be on call all the time, and that person might also not be available. Instead, they want three anaesthetists who live nearer Llandudno Hospital to be put on a local cover rota. They also pointed to an incident during which a patient had to wait for four hours for an anaesthetist. They had been pleased that the health authority's chairman, Grahame Hulse, had taken a sympathetic view. But the community health council's chief officer, Mrs Chris Stead, said the council had still not been given any assurances that the situation was being addressed.

Jury at site of crash tragedy By Daily Post Correspondent A JURY visited the scene of a horror car crash yesterday, in which an 81-year-old woman died. The 12 jurors boarded a coach outside Chester Crown Court which took them on a half-hour drive to the scene of the accident. Mrs Elsie Hayward was travelling with relatives in a Vauxhall Chevette along the A525 Wrexham to Ruthin road on March 29 last year when the accident happened, Chester Crown Court was told. Her car was ploughed into by 19-year-old Howard Sloane, whose Seat Ibiza skidded on a corner, said prosecutor Derek Halbert. Emergency Services staff battled for four hours to free Mrs Hayward, Mr Sloane and two others. An off-duty policeman was forced to slam on his brakes as Sloane sped past, and watched in horror as the Seat veered onto the wrong side of the road 325 yards before the smash, the court heard. Sloane, of The Mount, Meol Maelor, Coed Poeth, Wrexham, denies one charge of causing death by reckless driving. Mr Halbert told the court: \\u2018The car crossed from one side of the road to the other. \\u2018The policeman saw the car coming straight towards him, and thought he was going to be hit, and had to pull in to the side of the road. \\u2018The Seat car hit the Chevette, and a Cavalier car that was travelling behind it could not avoid crashing into it.\\u2019 The case continues.

Speaking at the annual speech day, Nigel Thorne, headmaster of Rydal school in Colwyn, said he was increasingly concerned at what was happening to the education system which was faced with a \\u2018testing monolith\\u2019. Although he welcomed many of the central themes in the Government White Paper, Choice and Diversity, he had reservations about the way the status of teachers was being undermined. The Government said parents knew best but that failed to recognise the professionalism of teachers and the close links between teachers, parents and schools. \\u2018A Government White Paper which proclaims that teachers know less about education than parents can scarcely hope to win the support of the teaching profession.\\u2019 But one of his biggest concerns was that the changes being \\u2018inflicted\\u2019 upon schools would significantly reduce the amount of enjoyment and fun in teaching. Her added: \\u2018The strong commitment to the whole idea of teaching is being undermined by more and more paper, and more and more stress. I want my colleagues to continue to enthuse about the job and teach effectively. I do not want them buried under mounds of paper.\\u2019 The amount of power ministers had seized for themselves over the development of young people was also worrying. The school's decision not to become involved in testing had been proved right. \\u2018The tests were poor discriminators and, in terms of checking on their progress and diagnosing their weaknesses, we could do a far better job ourselves in a fraction of the time,\\u2019 he declared He was worried that the teaching process could become dominated by tests and exams. Barrage shelved as cash runs out By Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs Correspondent PLANS for one of the most ambitious civil engineering projects envisaged for the North West are to be left gathering dust. Studies for the \\u00a31bn Mersey Barrage scheme have been shelved with no immediate plans for further work. Ironically, the project has reached the end of the road as its counterpart in Cardiff Bay begins its final stages through the House of Commons. Mersey Barrage Company general manager, James McCormack said: \\u2018The timing is not quite right. \\u2018Rather than plough on regardless damaging the scheme and the partnerships we have created, we have decided to suspend the project.\\u2019 Mr McCormack said this did not mean the barrage project was dead. \\u2018I am still absolutely convinced the barrage will be built,\\u2019 he said. John Major's government has refused to provide cash for phase four of the project, despite being told it would now cost substantially less than first thought. The writing was on the wall last year when the Government said it could not continue funding. Mossley Hill MP, David Alton, who chairs the all-party Mersey Barrage Group said: \\u2018Things are unlikely to happen until there is a political will and a more interventionist approach.\\u2019 The scheme, with its first three survey phases now complete, has cost \\u00a36.3m over the past six years. Canoe tragedy adventure centre closes THE adventure centre at the heart of the canoeing tragedy in which four teenagers died earlier this year has been sold and is to close with the loss of 20 jobs, it was announced yesterday. Simon Dunne, Claire Langley and Rachel Walker, all 16, and Dean Sayer, 17, died while on a course at the St Albans Centre in Lyme Regis, Dorset, in March. The four were members of a party of nine pupils and a teacher on an outdoor activity holiday arranged through their school, Southways Comprehensive School, Plymouth, Devon. Peter Kite managing director of the centre's owners, Active Learning and Leisure, announced yesterday's sale, which was for an undisclosed sum. He said directors at his firm, based in Kingston, Surrey, had decided that \\u2018it is in the best interests of both their clients and company to sell the business to the PGL adventure group\\u2019. The adventure centre would be closed until next year, Mr Kite said. \\u00a31m bid to cut op waiting lists By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff MORE than \\u00a31m is being pumped into initiatives to reduce hospital waiting lists in Clwyd this year. The money will be used to help patients waiting for operations in orthopaedic, urology, general and oral surgery areas. The Welsh Office is providing \\u00a32.7m of extra cash for the whole of Wales this year to help reduce waiting lists, and although yet to be finalised, Clwyd's share could be around \\u00a3400,000, says health authority treasurer, Nigel Morris. He told a joint meeting of the authority with Clwyd Family Health Services Association (FHSA) in Mold, that the authority will be bidding for its share within the next two weeks. Academic Added to this, Clwyd has put up its own \\u00a3300,000 towards waiting list initiatives, plus \\u00a3400,000 for academic and consultant appointments which will also allow more operations. Clwyd particularly wants to tackle the problem of people waiting over three months for outpatient appointments, and the few who are still waiting over 18 months for in-patient treatment. \\u2018Those are areas we hope to address this year,\\u2019 said health authority chief executive, Brian Jones. Last year's Welsh Office waiting list initiative offering particular operations at certain centres was not a great success in Clwyd when patients showed little enthusiasm to travel to South Wales or Bangor for hip, knee and eye operations. Meanwhile, news that the Welsh Office is to set up a forensic psychiatry unit in North Wales a medium secure unit was given a cautious welcome. Authority chief executive Brian Jones, and FHSA chief executive Christopher Last both warned it could prove costly. The unit is likely to be based at the Bryn-y-Neuadd hospital in Llanfairfeshan, near Bangor. Clwyd already pays about \\u00a3500,000 a year to keep people in medium secure units in England. Cot deaths toll halved COT deaths were more than halved last year following a national campaign to sleep babies on their back, it was revealed yesterday. A \\u00a32m TV campaign backed by presenter Anne Diamond, whose son Sebastian was a cot death victim two years ago, has resulted in a fall from 912 deaths in 1991 to 456 last year. Man dies after night fishing trip disaster ONE of four fishermen rescued early after a 15ft boat sank in the Bristol Channel died in hospital last night. Wayne Cummings, 32, was plucked unconscious from the water by the crew of an RAF helicopter more than three hours after the craft capsized off Llantwit Major, South Glamorgan. He was among three friends to be rescued. A fourth managed to swim several hundred yards to shore to raise the alarm. Mr Cummings, of Ffordd Elin, Barry, South Glamorgan, had been in a \\u2018critical\\u2019 condition at Cardiff's Royal Infirmary suffering from severe hypothermia. His companions, Philip Turner, 40, Nigel Dee and Vaughan Thomas, all from the Barry area, were treated for exposure but were less seriously ill. Swansea coastguards, who organised the rescue, said it was unlikely anybody would have survived without life-jackets. The all-night fishing trip ended in tragedy for the four men after their boat ran out of fuel and ran aground on a sandbank off Nash Point. It was swamped by the incoming tide and sank at about 5am yesterday. A Sea King helicopter from RAF Brawdy, Dyfed, joined lifeboats from Barry and Porthcawl in the rescue more than three hours later after a cliff-top walker spotted men in the water. A coastguard spokesman said the other two \\u2018undoubtedly survived because they were wearing lifejackets, which also made them easier to spot in the water.\\u2019 Newspaper law change By Ian Lang Daily Post Staff NEWSAGENTS will today be urged to back calls for a change in the law to protect them from becoming innocent victims of the law which prevents tobacco being sold to under-age youngsters. A resolution, to be put to the national conference of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents in Llandudno, suggests it is wrong for \\u2018agent provocateurs\\u2019 children sent for cigarettes by adults to be used to trap shopkeepers. Newsagents claim it is the buyer who should face legal action for allowing tobacco to get into under-age hands. They argue that it is easy for someone to appear to be above the age of 17 and say laws should be introduced that place less onus on the newsagent, who may be an innocent victim. Hundreds of delegates are attending the conference. The federation represents almost 29,000 independent newsagents from around the UK and Republic of Ireland. Another strong theme in the conference is what is seen as a threat posed to the traditional newsagent. Community police move MAJOR renovation and refurbishment to the police station at Rhuddlan has meant transferring the Community Police base to St Asaph, say North Wales police. The work is expected to take eight to 12 weeks. Anyone wishing to contact the community team can do so by telephoning Rhyl police and asking for St Asaph police station. Samantha Ward Tadman, 10, of Rhyl, has just taken up the cello, and after only a few months, the prize-winning pianist has passed her first cello exam Picture: PHIL MICHEU Mountain air rescue TWO police cadets from Essex suffering from heat exhaustion were winched off 3,000ft high Tryfan in Snowdonia by an RAF rescue helicopter yesterday. One of them had been unconscious for a while. They were flown by the helicopter, from Valley in Anglesey, to Ysbyty Gwynedd at Bangor for treatment. Fans' deaths bring TT death toll to nine TWO MORE people have died in the Isle of Man TT Races. A man and his woman pillion passenger died instantly when they lost control of the machine and hit a wall. The fans' deaths brought the death toll to nine in this year's race week. They were negotiating a part of the 38-mile long course known as Guthrie's Memorial on the Snaefell Mountain Road. A spokesman for the island's police said last night: \\u2018The accident happened at 12.23pm on the TT course. Some riders get away with serious injuries if you can say that, but others are not so fortunate. \\u2018To be honest, we have not been any busier this year but the accident toll has been higher than in previous times.\\u2019 He declined to give any personal details about the pair apart from saying they were from the United Kingdom. All the victims killed during this year's competition were fans and not professional riders. Community officer chosen IN a new move to boost community relations in the region, North Wales Police are to appoint a Community officer to serve the Rhydwen Drive district of Rhyl. Discovery of devout OAP's body stuns town By Gareth Hughes Daily Post Staff A TOWN was in shock yesterday after a well-known local character was found dead at her home. The body of 87-year-old Mattie Edwards had been found in her terraced house in Mwrog Street, Ruthin, on Monday night. Last night, a 55-year-old local man was charged with murder and he is expected to appear before Dyffryn Clwyd magistrates at Denbigh later today. Detective Supt Gareth Jones, deputy head of North Wales CID, has been called in to head the inquiry and a post-mortem examination was carried out by Home Office pathologist Dr Donald Waite. Mrs Edwards, a widow, lived alone in the neat terraced house opposite the Farmers' Arms where she was born. She owned several properties in the area. Throughout her life she was a regular worshipper at Llanfwrog Parish Church, even though in recent years she was largely confined to her home. She was in church last Sunday morning, having been taken in a wheelchair by a friend. \\u2018She thought a lot of the church and attended very regularly. Church members were also very good to her,\\u2019 said secretary Rona Edwards. Travelled Two years ago, Mrs Edwards, who preferred her first name Grace to Mattie, travelled to Israel with fellow church members. \\u2018It had always been her ambition to go to the Holy Land and so when I arranged the trip I told her \\u2018Right, now you're going\\u2019. She was a committed churchgoer,\\u2019 said the Rev Godfrey Caine Jones, former rector of Llanfwrog, who is now vicar of Ruabon. For some time, Mrs Edwards worked in the Denbigh office of solicitors Kerfoot Owen and Company but for many years had to care for her elderly mother with whom she lived. She had no children and her only brother, John, died some years ago. \\u2018She didn't mix an awful lot but friends were always popping in and out because the door was open. It's a terrible shock for something like this to happen,\\u2019 said one neighbour. \\u2018She was a delightful person,\\u2019 said Betty Turley, also of Mwrog Street. Mrs Edwards's former next-door neighbour, Ruth Duncan, called to see her every day and spent some time with her on Monday evening, leaving about 9pm. Mrs Duncan, who now lives in Bryn Rhydd, Ruthin, was too upset to talk yesterday. Mattie Edwards: \\u2018a delightful person\\u2019 Derek tells world and 100 tourists of his love\\u2026 A COMPUTER expert gave his girlfriend an olde worlde surprise when he enlisted the help of a town crier to ask her to marry him. Two weeks ago Sharon Edwards began teasing Darren Johnson over his \\u2018lack of romance\\u2019. But yesterday, after 25-year-old Derek from Huntington, Chester, popped the question, Sharon, 22, admitted she was stunned. Mr Johnson secretly arranged with deputy crier David Mitchell to propose during one of his ear-splitting announcements. So, while out on a shopping trip, Darren stepped forward as a volunteer to help the crier with a proclamation of his own. In town crier fashion he bellowed: \\u2018I call upon these persons here present to witness that I, Darren John Johnson, being of sound mind, do ask my beloved Sharon Samantha Edwards, if she will plight her troth unto me.\\u2019 And in front of more than 100 cheering tourists, Sharon accepted. Mr Mitchell then took up his cry of \\u2018The lady hath accepted.\\u2019 Sharon, who works at a miniature models factory in Wrexham, said: \\u2018I have been teasing him for about two weeks for not being romantic but he has shown me I was wrong. \\u2018I was not suspicious at all and did not know anything about it. It was a big shock and when I said yes there were about 100 Australian tourists cheering and photographing us.\\u2019 Darren said: \\u2018We are both history lovers so enlisting the town crier's help seemed the ideal way to propose. \\u2018I was glad she accepted because otherwise I would have looked a right banana in front of all those tourists.\\u2019 Mr Mitchell said Darren's announcement was \\u2018quite authentic\\u2019. Easy rider's stolen bike A MOTORCYCLIST on a stolen bike was stopped by police for not wearing a crash helmet, Colwyn Bay magistrates heard yesterday. Graham Mayers, 25, of Pensarn, was fined \\u00a372 and \\u00a320 costs. He admitted receiving stolen property and breach of a conditional discharge. Builders battle in the sand for beach bonanza WIRRAL Housing Department scooped a major public relations windfall last night all for the cost of a few sticks of rock. Hundreds of people descended on Wallasey beach in the bright evening sunshine to see a dozen teams vie for honours in a novelty sand-building competition. Teams representing a cross-section of housing interests were set the task of building a sandy estate incorporating a housing mix of family and old folks' homes. The venture \\u2014 to spotlight National Housing Week \\u2014 was such a success that hopes are high it will develop into an annual competition. The event realised \\u00a3600 to provide smoke alarms for the homes of elderly people. Top prize, and a special trophy, went to Beechwood Community Association, with minor prizes going to Forum Housing Association and Hanks Builders. All 48 people who took an active part in last night's exercise were given a New Brighton stick of rock. Wirral housing director John Agass commented: \\u2018The residents\\u2019 groups in particular concentrated mainly on traditional housing designs, which probably reflects what they are looking for in housing. Their views should be taken into account.\\u2019 Beechwood add finishing touches to their winning sand houses, aided by radio personality Billy Butler Picture: FRAZER BIRD New future dawns for historic school A HISTORIC Wirral landmark, rescued from dereliction by a local company, is to be officially opened by Baroness Chalker. The former Laird School of Art in Birkenhead the first purpose-built art school in Britain has been transformed into prestigious offices by Stanton Marine, with the help of grants from the City Lands scheme. Stanton Marine are international marine surveyors and consultants. Director Bill MacDonald said: \\u2018I am delighted that this beautiful Victorian building has been rescued and restored to its former glory. \\u2018The directors of the company decided that the building would not only serve as its headquarters, but also be renamed the John Laird Centre to acknowledge the contribution of the Laird family to the area.\\u2019 The interior of the building will be furnished with Laird artefacts with the help of Wirral Council historian David Hillhouse. The opening ceremony is scheduled for Friday. Baroness Chalker Thieving trio use baby to con elderly woman By Richard Elias Daily Post Staff A WOMAN clutching a baby stole an elderly woman's purse after conning her way into the pensioner's home. The thief called at the house on east Merseyside with another woman and a man, and asked if she could use the toilet. But, minutes later, when the trio had left, the 89-year-old discovered that her purse had been taken from a bedroom of her terraced home in Albany Road, Prescot. Last night, a detective investigating the theft said that although this type of crime was becoming increasingly prevalent, it was the first time he had heard of a baby being used as a decoy. Det Con Steve Roberts added: \\u2018It is unusual to say the least, the fact that one of these women was holding a baby at the time.\\u2019 The three called on the victim who lives alone shortly before 9pm on Monday night. The woman who was holding the baby is described as being white, in her 30s and had brown, tidy, collar-length hair. Her female accomplice was in her 20s, with long, fair hair. The man was around 5ft 4ins and had fair hair. The gang left in a blue car. Anyone who has any information about the incident is asked to contact Prescot CID on  ext 4285. Ex-trade unionist jailed for theft By Lynda Roughley Daily Post Correspondent FORMER Liverpool City Council trade unionist Tony Gavin, who stole welfare funds including death benefits, was yesterday jailed for three months. Gavin, 35, who was a fulltime Nalgo official, admitted stealing cash belonging to the City Council Life Insurance Welfare Scheme over 22 months. Liverpool Crown Court judge David Lynch, sentencing Gavin, said that he had used the fund's bank account as his own and had stolen between \\u00a33,500 to \\u00a34,200. He had taken the money to pay off debts and had continued to do so even when bereaved relatives were desperate for cash to pay undertakers' bills. \\u2018That is unforgivable,\\u2019 said the judge. Gavin, of Briar Drive, Huyton, pleaded guilty to eight offences of theft between January 1990 and October 1991. He denied a further 10 theft and deception offences and not guilty verdicts were recorded. Prosecuting counsel Antonis Georges said Gavin had been treasurer of the Welfare Scheme since 1985. Each week 800 council employees voluntarily contributed 50p from their wages of which 31p was paid to an insurance company which paid out \\u00a32,750 upon death. The balance of the contribution was paid into the Welfare Fund, which had a bank account, and was used to provide interest-free hardship loans. \\u2018Gavin used the Welfare account as if it was his own money,\\u2019 Mr Georges said. He wrote out cheques from the account to pay his credit card debts, rent arrears and he also used it to clear phone bills and part of \\u00a3500 taxi bill. The taxi bill arose after he opened an account for Nalgo with Mersey Cabs without authorisation and used it for his own personal use as well as official business. Mr Georges said that mobile phone calls Gavin made included many to race lines. Matters came to a head after relatives of the deceased employees did not receive the expected death benefits even though the insurance company had paid out the cheques to the fund. Gavin repeatedly tried to fob them off and one family had still not been paid. \\u00a3231 fine for car tax fraud A WOMAN was fined \\u00a3231 with \\u00a330 costs yesterday after she admitted fraudulent use of a car tax disc. Suzanne Gratton, 22, of Warwick Close, Birkenhead, was accused after it was noticed that the licence on her car had been taken out for another vehicle. Appearing with her before Wirral magistrates was Craig Blackwell, 23, of the same address, who admitted allowing fraudulent use of the licence. He told the magistrates the licence was for a car which had not been on the road for nine months. He took the blame for Miss Gratton's appearance. He was fined \\u00a384 with \\u00a330 costs. Youthful TV judges A YOUNG panel of judges will tour the Merseyside Maritime Museum this morning. The six will give their views as part of the first ever children's museum of the year competition. Organised by BBC TV's Blue Peter programme, the Albert Dock attraction is one of three shortlisted museums nominated by viewers. Maria Hogan, 12, of Rock Ferry, the pupil of Plessington School who nominated the museum, will meet the show's presenters. Public urged to come to rescue of swimming pool By Geoff Barnes Daily Post Staff LABOUR councillors have called for a massive public demonstration to save Woodchurch swimming pool, amid fears it could be lost \\u2018by stealth.\\u2019 The pool has been closed after being condemned as a health hazard because of structural faults. Councillors have been told repairs will cost about \\u00a31m. Wirral Council has earmarked \\u00a3150,000 in its capital programme for refurbishment work. But there are fears a further cash squeeze by Whitehall could jeopardise its completion. Labour councillor Hugh Lloyd, who represents Upton, said: \\u2018It all depends on what the Government say and what we get from land sales. \\u2018If Whitehall clamps down on capital expenditure there will be real problems for whole areas of capital spending not just Woodchurch pool. \\u2018With money so tight and nothing is heard from local communities the facility could be lost by stealth. \\u2018I am desperately anxious to avoid this happening. \\u2018It is important for the saving of the pool to be at the forefront of everyone's minds it should be treated as a number one priority.\\u2019 Labour Coun George Davies, a qualified swimming instructor, said Woodchurch's closure deprived a huge area of swimming facilities. He pointed out that since 1974, Wirral had lost five pools New Brighton, Derby Pool, Wallasey, New Ferry open air pool, Livingstone Street, Birkenhead, and Hoylake. He said: \\u2018The Labour group is committed to retaining Woodchurch pool. \\u2018It is a service we can't afford to do without.\\u2019 Labour councillors are planning to rally action at a public meeting at Woodchurch leisure centre on June 22. They also plan to launch a petition. Quiz of couple goes on over murder of OAP A COUPLE were still being questioned by detectives last night in connection with the murder of pensioner John Goult. The man and woman from Liverpool were arrested on Monday afternoon after a public appeal for witnesses to the killing of 80-year-old Mr Goult last Friday night. Mr Goult was found dead in an armchair at his ground floor flat in Woolfall Heath Avenue, Huyton, on Saturday afternoon. A post mortem revealed he had been stabbed repeatedly in the chest and died about 7pm on Friday night. Mr Goult's pet terrier Champ was found lying by his side and is now being cared for at Huyton police station until a suitable home is found for him. Anyone with any information is asked to ring the incident hotline on  in confidence. \\u00a3270,000 \\u2018slap in face\\u2019 for pit town By Peter McBride Daily Post Correspondent A MINING town devastated by the closure of a nearby colliery just days ago was yesterday given a Government cash boost. However, news of the \\u00a3270,000 package sparked anger from workers and the St Helens town council leader who described it as \\u2018a slap in the face.\\u2019 The gates of Parkside Colliery, at Newton le Willows, closed last Friday. Around 700 pit workers were made redundant, just two years after the colliery was praised by the Government for breaking production records. Amid angry calls from union leaders for the Government to change its mind, Inner Cities Minister Sir George Young yesterday confirmed the Department of Environment's stand. \\u2018British Coal has now indicated that, following the recent High Court judgment, they will be proceeding with the closure of Parkside Colliery. \\u2018I feel that now is an appropriate time to complete the announcement of May 13 of the full extent of support from the Government to those areas where the affected pits are situated. \\u2018The cash will provide significant benefits to the areas and communities affected by possible pit closures.\\u2019 But last night St Helens council leader Dave Watts attacked the Government's announcement. \\u2018The timing is beautiful. On Friday they close us down. Today they give us a meagre amount of the cash which they had previously taken off us in the form of grant cutbacks,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018It is a pittance and it will not help us deal with the huge problems caused by the closure of Parkside. \\u2018It is a slap in the face, a sweetener, a paltry gesture which indicates the help they intend to give us.\\u2019 Anglers net 2,000 fish to save club ANGLERS are celebrating after landing a huge catch of fish which has ensured their club's survival. Fishing tackle manufacturers Daiwa Sports Ltd has donated around \\u00a310,000 worth of freshwater fish to the Broughton Hall Angling Club, West Derby just 12 months after all their fish were wiped out in a oil spill. The private club faced closure before the Japanese firm stepped in with the 2,000-fish donation. \\u2018Fish in lakes and rivers are at the mercy of environmental factors as Broughton Hall anglers know only too well,\\u2019 said Daiwa managing director Sam Aoki yesterday. \\u2018Fish are in short supply in many fisheries. We plan to plant the seeds to improve a number of fisheries every year.\\u2019 A combination of oil being dumped in the lake and excessive algae killed the fish last year. Delighted club secretary Paul McCoy said yesterday: \\u2018Talk about our luck changing! We are absolutely thrilled that Daiwa will be helping us in such an effective way. Concern for missing patient POLICE are becoming increasingly concerned about the welfare of a 30-year-old woman who has not been seen since she walked out of Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, two weeks ago. Diane Wright, of The Greenway, Dovecote, Liverpool, was being treated at the hospital for anorexia. A police spokesman said last night: \\u2018Miss Wright simply walked out of the hospital at 2pm on May 23 and has not been seen since.\\u2019 Twitchers' eagle error BLUNDERING birdwatchers may be to blame for the failure of England's only breeding pair of Golden Eagles to produce chicks for the first time in four years. The pair produced two eggs in their eyrie in Haweswater, Cumbria, but experts fear twitchers may have breached an exclusion zone set up by the RSPB. EX-UNION BOSS SENT TO PRISON Three-month sentence for official who stole \\u00a33,000 By Harry Dean FORMER Liverpool City Council union official Tony Gavin was jailed for three months at Liverpool Crown Court for theft this afternoon. Gavin, 35, stole more than \\u00a33,000 from a fund set up to help grieving families, the court had been told. And in passing sentence Judge David Lynch told him: \\u2018You caused a great deal of distress and anger.\\u2019 The court was told that Gavin, full-time city council union official at the time of the offences, handed over some of the cash as hardship payments to striking bin men. Gavin, of Briar Drive, Huyton, admitted eight charges of stealing cash from the council's Life Insurance Welfare Scheme. Gavin, since been dismissed by local government union Nalgo, was a full-time union official representing thousands of council employees. Antonis Georges, prosecuting, told an earlier hearing that Gavin admitted to the police he wrote out cheques for amounts ranging from \\u00a359 to \\u00a3711 which he claimed he intended to repay. But in some cases two years had elapsed without the money being refunded by him. One of the offences to which Gavin pleaded guilty was a specimen charge of \\u00a3100, an amount he admitted taking from the account once or twice a month between March and October 1991. Gavin denied 10 charges of theft and three of deception, and he was found not guilty on these 13 charges. Judge Lynch told Gavin: \\u2018Over two years you used the fund as an extra bank account of your own. Trust \\u2019 You did not lead a particularly high life style and the money went to pay of credit cards, rent arrears, phone bills and taxi fares. \\u2018It was a very serious breach of trust. You were taking money out of this fund when relatives of the dead were hoping to be paid funeral expenses, and this caused a great deal of distress and anger.\\u2019 Anthony Carus, defending, said Gavin was the treasurer of the fund. The administration was always poor and in 1991 it became chaotic. He said that the Treasurers department at Liverpool City Council was responsible for deducting contributions to the fund from employees, but errors regularly cropped up. All the work eventually fell on Gavin shoulders. He did not receive any payment for his work with the fund. Mr Carus said there was strike action and Gavin was hounded by refuse collectors to make on-the-spot hardship payments in pubs and clubs. Gavin was called on to act as press liaison officer. He was under tremendous pressure and on the go for more than 12 hours a day. He said Gavin had used the money to pay off debts. Council boost for registry offices By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff COUNCILLORS asked to save money by closing seven offices used for registering births, deaths and marriages have decided to spend money promoting them. Some outstations were so far out of the way, the public did not know they were there, said Prestatyn Coun Richard Edwards. He told Clwyd's environment and protection committee he was angry about proposals to the end the grass-roots service. Officials wanted consultation on the future of Caergwrle, Buckley, Connah's Quay, Denbigh, Prestatyn, Chirk and Ruabon. Caergwrle and Buckley have had only six callers between them in six months. Problems But Coun Edwards said: \\u2018It's like British Rail, you reduce the service bit by bit then you shut it. We have, in Prestatyn, a facility which is very central and well used, despite the fact that the signs advertising it have been changed three times in five years.\\u2019 Prestatyn Coun Rhiannon Hughes said the alternative of going to Bodelwyddan would pose huge problems for those without transport. Coun David Messham said the money which was going to be used on the consultation process would be better spent advertising and promoting the outstations. Councillors agreed to try to promote the outstations for 12 months to see if the public make more use of them. Hospice hopes receive vital cash boost FUNDS of a home care unit to be opened in September at the Hospice of the Good Shepherd, Backford, will be boosted with a grant of \\u00a35,000 from a medical insurance agency. Building of the new unit, at a cost of \\u00a3120,000, is almost complete. A fund-raising fun run is being held on Sunday. Friends talk about gardens ORGANIC gardening will be explained this evening at a meeting of Halton Friends of the Earth. Guest speaker at the meeting, in Waterloo Community Centre, Runcorn Old Town, is Jim Hay (7.45pm). Memorial EXTENSIONS to the Pavilion in Barrow in memory of the late Coun Walter Mapes will be opened today by his widow Annie (6.30pm). Curry attack too hot for knife men By Daily Post Correspondent STAFF at an Indian restaurant forced two angry knife-wielding customers to flee by bombarding them with curry powder, a court was told. Paul Sharp, 27, and David Sweeney, 28, argued with the manager of the Step In Indian restaurant in Foregate Street, Chester, and then followed him into the kitchen, Chester Crown Court heard yesterday. Sharp allegedly picked up a 12-inch knife and threatened to kill manager Jason Ali, but was overpowered by staff and covered in chilli and curry powder by the chef, said Philip Hughes, prosecuting. Sharp, of Rhuddlan Road, Blacon and Sweeney, of Hatton Road, Blacon, both deny two charges of assault causing actual bodily harm and affray. Mr Hughes told the jury: \\u2018The defendants complained that their table cloth was dirty and were generally noisy and offensive. \\u2018When Mr Ali asked them to leave, Sharp became aggressive and Mr Ali went into the kitchen. \\u2018Sharp followed him in and picked up a 12-inch knife and threatened to kill him and other staff. \\u2018Staff disarmed him but then he head-butted Mr Ali quite deliberately with such force he fell backwards.\\u2019 Mr Hughes said Sweeney picked up a knife from a table and stabbed the restaurant's owner with it in the back of the hand. He added: \\u2018Sharp then started to chase Mr Ali around. The staff tried to subdue the defendants by throwing curry and chilli powder at them.\\u2019 The court was told that when arrested, the pair complained to police they were injured by having curry powder thrown at them. The trial continues. Girl, 8 \\u2018no angel\\u2019 says sex case judge A SEX offender escaped jail yesterday after a judge said the eight-year-old girl he abused was \\u2018not entirely an angel\\u2019. Judge Ian Starforth Hill, QC, gave Karl Gambrill two years probation at Winchester Crown Court for attempted unlawful intercourse. He told Gambrill he would have faced a prison sentence but for mitigating circumstances. \\u2018The law in this country protects little girls because they do not know what is right and what is wrong. \\u2018They would take part in sexual activities because they would think that was right. \\u2018However, I have been provided with information which leads me to think she was not entirely an angel herself, which is no excuse for you. \\u2018And you were only 18 at the time as opposed to being a grown man.\\u2019 Gambrill, now 21, of Southampton, Hants, pleaded guilty. He was ordered to attend a programme of treatment for his sexual problems and pay \\u00a3100 costs. Crash victim named A WOMAN killed in a road accident at Little Neston on Monday has been named as Audrey Wells, 66, of West Kirby. Mrs Wells was killed when a Nissan Sunny, in which she was a passenger, was in collision with a Ford Transit van on Marshlands Road. Her husband, Edwin, who was driving, has serious injuries. The driver of the Transit was not badly hurt in the accident. League's \\u00a32m ground plan A MOVE that would generate around \\u00a32million to help pay for improvements at Football League grounds is set to go ahead this week. The cash will be raised by a five per cent levy on all transfer fees received by the clubs and a 10 per cent cut of their end-of-season prize-money from the League. The proposal goes before chairmen at the League's annual meeting on Friday and seems certain to be endorsed. League spokesman Ian Cotton said: \\u2018It will show that League football is doing something to help itself fulfil the requirements of the Lord Justice Taylor report. \\u2018If we apply the levies to the last full financial year, they would have raised almost \\u00a32million\\u00a31.6m generated by transfers and \\u00a3360,000 from prize money.\\u2019 The cash generated will not be held in a central pool but in individual accounts for each club. The money each club generates is held for that club to use for improvements, alterations and safety measures. Friday's meeting, to be held at Walsall's Bescot stadium, will also discuss a number of changes to League rules. The League is anxious to protect its lucrative link-up with the pools' companies and the growing number of teams moving from the normal Saturday date has seen the day's fixture list shrunk. The League proposes that games can only be switched from Saturday on police instructions or because of television commitments. Proposals include both teams taking to the field together before kick-off and permitting three substitutes instead of the current two, with the third being a \\u2018recognised goalkeeper\\u2019, as in the Premier League. Clubs also look set to be given the option of having players' names on the back of their shirts. Princess meets charity \\u2018heroine\\u2019 By Sherai Raif Daily Post Correspondent THE PRINCESS of Wales met one of her heroines when Mother Teresa of Calcutta visited her at Kensington Palace. Mother Teresa was driven there from one of her missions in Kensal Rise, west London. After returning to the three-storey house in Bravington Road, she said: \\u2018It was a brief visit. There was no discussion.\\u2019 Asked if the Princess had changed since their last meeting at the mission in September 1991, Mother Teresa said: \\u2018She was as I know her.\\u2019 The elderly founder of the charity helping children in the back streets of Calcutta is making a brief visit to Britain after a visit to Ireland. The Princess and Mother Teresa first met in Rome. Mother Teresa's invitation to Kensington Palace confirms the admiration and respect the Princess of Wales has for the 82-year-old aid worker. Mother Teresa, who last week spoke out about the evil of divorce, made an anguished comment in the wake of the announcement of the Royal marriage split. She told The Universe, the Catholic weekly: \\u2018I am praying for the family and I feel very sorry for them. \\u2018Love begins at home and the family that prays together stays together.\\u2019 Yesterday's meeting is likely to fuel further speculation about the Princess's interest in Catholicism. Yesterday, the Princess also turned down an invitation to try out a hospital treadmill saying she was much too fit already. She was visiting Glasgow's Western Infirmary to learn about pioneering work to find new ways to treat asthma. Earlier the Princess, who is the patron of the International Spinal Research Trust, visited Scotland's national spinal-injury unit in the city. Afterwards, she visited the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons and was told surgeons there will soon be able to practise their skills using virtual-reality equipment. Police warning on gun suspect A MAN on the run from the French Foreign Legion and branded \\u2018Psycho\\u2019 by his former comrades is still being hunted by murder squad detectives. Justin Martin-Clarke is wanted in connection with the drugs-related shooting of a businessman in April. Last night a nationwide alert was issued for the former foreign embassy bodyguard, who has Merseyside connections, and the public was warned not to approach him under any circumstances. Hertfordshire Police are leading the hunt for Clarke following the murder of Paul Milburn on April 26 in St Albans. The 43-year-old victim was discovered in his Saab car with a single gunshot wound to the chest. Clarke, 38, has not been seen since. Detectives believe he was killed after a drugs deal went wrong. Det Sgt Greg Cooper, who is heading the murder inquiry, said: \\u2018Clarke is extremely dangerous and is considered armed. On no account should he be approached.\\u2019 He added: \\u2018Clarke has long-standing links with north london and Merseyside and has a slight Liverpool accent. He is not known to have a wide circle of friends, in fact people tend to steer clear of him. \\u2018However, he is extremely plausible and a good talker. People should be on their guard.\\u2019 Clarke is a former nightclub bouncer who joined the Foreign Legion in 1980 but went absent without leave just nine months later. He is described as being white, around 6ft tall with broad shoulders and dark, curly hair. Anyone who can help Hertfordshire Police is asked to contact  or Merseyside Police on . \\u2018War at sea\\u2019 launched By David Greenwood Daily Post Staff IRISH Sea ferry operators B&I and Stena Sealink are ready to battle it out for passengers this summer. The opening shots have been fired by Dublin-based B&I with the introduction of the first\\u2019 super ferry\\u2019out of the Anglesey port of Holyhead. And next month the port's owners, Sealink, will hit back by launching its fast Sealynx service. But yesterday, as B&I showed off its 20,000 tonne vessel, the Isle of Innisfree, to travel agents, local civic leaders and the media, company officials said they were not worried by the opposition's planned move. B&I's UK passenger manager Victor Williams said it was just the start of the company getting into the \\u2018super phase mould.\\u2019 \\u2018Competition is fierce but we believe we have, in this ferry, a product of the highest quality,\\u2019 he said. Mr Williams said the Isle of Innisfree, capable of carrying 1,800 passengers and 411 cars, was the first of its class to come into Holyhead. \\u2018And we are delighted that we are the ones to bring it here,\\u2019 he added. Mr Williams predicted that everyone would be happy with the service provided on the ship which has been upgraded as part of a \\u00a36m investment throughout the line's car ferry fleet. \\u2018Car passengers from all over the country arriving at Holyhead want a relaxed journey to Dublin. This ferry is the way to do it it just oozes luxury.\\u2019 He explained that an innovation on the ship, bought a year ago from a Danish company, was the introduction of a \\u2018club class\\u2019 ideal for the businessman who wanted to get away from the crowd. Facilities include phones and fax machines. There are also new lounges for motorists, service restaurants, a play area, casino and cinemas. The Isle of Innisfree berthed at Holyhead yesterday Council bid to save energy HOUSING chiefs in Warrington have approved a programme of pilot initiatives to improve energy efficiency in council houses. The work will include cavity wall insulation, roof insulation, double glazing and installation of energy efficient heating systems. Housing director Tom Roberts said energy efficiency would benefit the tenants by reducing fuel bills, and the council by reducing maintenance costs due to condensation problems and increasing the value of the dwellings. It would also increase rent revenue as tenants would be better off and more satisfied, and could also increase the authority's chances of winning more money from the Government. Crime figures rise again LATEST figures show Cheshire's police force is still fighting a losing battle against a rising tide of crime. The force has come in for criticism in the past two months after figures released on the constabulary's \\u2018crime-free day\\u2019 in April showed Cheshire had suffered the highest rise in crime in the country. Figures released yesterday for the first four months of the year show total crime in the county is up 12pc on this time last year, with the detection rate down by 3pc. Chief Constable David Graham expressed concern about robberies which are up by 23pc with 130 offences in the first four months of the year. He said: \\u2018I am concerned but these figures may have something to do with the fact that as a direct result of the Warrington bombing and shooting the serious crime squad has been completely centred at Warrington, which has left the rest of the county without adequate cover. \\u2018But I am hoping with normality returning, we might see a falling of these figures.\\u2019 Sexual offences are down on the same period last year by 31pc. Fear for future o f special hospital FAMILIES who fear that a special hospital is to close have accused health service managers of snubbing their request for consultation. More than 30 patients at the Manor Bungalows, in Little Sutton, Ellesmere Port, could be moved elsewhere under an option being considered by Chester Health Authority. The authority wants to revamp the site to meet new social services guidelines limiting the number of people in each bungalow from eight to six. They have confirmed that one option under consideration is to close down the site. But Chief Executive Ralph Murray has promised that no hasty decision will be taken and that full consultation will be held with the carers before any action is taken. But the families say they have still not been told anything by the health authority. Coun Peter Sheppard, who is representing the families, said: \\u2018They are very angry that after the initial assurance of consultation they have still not heard anything. \\u2018They are very worried about the place and the effect of the uncertainty. \\u2018They want to hear what is going on and what the future holds for the Manor bungalows.\\u2019 The Manor bungalows are run for the authority by private firm McIntyre. They families say that people with severe learning difficulties do not adapt well to sudden changes of environment. Mr Murray was not available for comment last night. LABRADOR bitch, 9 years old, OAP owner gone into care; free to good home. Jilted man's suicide A MAN hanged himself in his bedroom after he became depressed about a break-up with his girlfriend. An inquest in Liverpool heard that unemployed printer Philip Banks, 31, moved back in with his aunt, Hilda Barrett, after his girlfriend left him and returned to her husband. Mrs Barrett said she found her nephew hanging in the bedroom of his home in Oakhill Road, Oak Vale Park, Liverpool, on the evening of February 11. She released him from the leather strap then ran next door to call the police. Merseyside Coroner Roy Barter heard that Mr Banks returned to England in 1985 after his family emigrated to Zambia then moved to South Africa. After living with his aunt for four years, Mr Banks moved in with his girlfriend, but he moved back home last September after the couple split up a few weeks later and became very depressed. He was diagnosed anti-depressants by his doctor but failed to take them and did not return for a check up two weeks later. Mr Barter recorded a suicide verdict and expressed his sympathy to Mr Banks' family. Man's nose bitten off A MAN of 28 who bit of the tip of another man's nose during a fight has been jailed for 18 months. Michael Connolly, of Wellington Road, Toxteth, had pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to wounding Brian Daly, 24, with intent. David Owen, prosecuting, said the men were fighting outside the Volunteer pub in Park Road, Toxteth. Daly was taken to hospital where surgeons sewed the nose back on. Defence counsel Brendan Carville said Connolly was not a violent man. Blackmail of firm denied A MAN set up a protection racket and demanded thousands of pounds from a building firm, it was alleged yesterday. Gary Grugel, 40, of East Millwood Road, Speke, Liverpool, has pleaded not guilty to 10 offences involving blackmail, attempting to pervert the course of justice, wounding with intent and assault. Prosecuting counsel Mark Brown claimed at Liverpool Crown Court: \\u2018Grugel, by the use of intimidation and threats of serious physical violence, sought to operate a protection racket.\\u2019 He told the jury that Joseph Marland owned a building company. He bought a site in Ramsfield Road and development work began in the winter of 1990. The following September, while Mr Marland was on holiday, Grugel spoke to Marland's son-in-law, who had been left in charge. He claimed Mr Marland had agreed he should look after the site and demanded money. Mr Johns said he knew nothing of this but the next day Grugel again asked for money and became aggressive. Mr Brown alleged that Grugel twice asked plasterer Peter McCabe for some plaster boards and when he threatened to tell the police Grugel assaulted him, causing a laceration above his eyebrow which needed hospital treatment. Grugel threatened he would break Mr McCabe's legs. That evening, Grugel spoke to Mr Johns saying that if the police were informed \\u2018his brother-in-law would come looking for Mr Johns\\u2019. Mr Johns spoke to McCabe and stopped him reporting it, It was claimed that there were further threats and assaults and Grugel was given money. The case continues. Rockers digit PETE Townshend played air guitar on his shovel and Chuck Berry flashed his famous footwork as they helped break ground for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, yesterday. The \\u00a355m project is scheduled for completion in June 1995. Fire bird gone A BUDGERIGAR is missing this morning after fire destroyed his cage. The blaze broke out in the house in Ashurst, Skemersdale, Lancashire, shortly after 3pm yesterday. The rest of the property was slightly damaged. A fire brigade spokesman said: \\u2018We could find no trace of the bird.\\u2019 Foster-son tells of island farmhouse \\u2018whipping ordeal\\u2019 By Daily Post Correspondent A TEENAGER yesterday claimed he was beaten with a horsewhip sometimes while dangling upside down from a rope by his foster father. Paul Llewelyn Jones told a jury at Mold Crown Court he was beaten with a cane or a whip three or four times a week and was forced to scour bins for food. When he was hungry, he went to eat the left-overs thrown to the dogs outside the Anglesey farmhouse where he was staying with foster parents. And when he was caught he was given a bowl of Winalot dog food, he alleged. \\u2018I ate it. I had no choice because I was starving. I felt sick after that,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018They used to make me look a fool and leave a bowl outside for me.\\u2019 Norman Roberts, 59, of Ysgubor Escob at Gwalchmai, Anglesey, denies cruelty by wilful ill treatment and assault. His wife, Evelyn, 59, of the same address, denies wilful neglect and their son, Ian Roberts, 34, denies common assault. All the alleged incidents are said to have taken place between 1980 when he was fostered at the age of six by the family and 1985. The court was also told that Gwynedd Social Services department left the boy with the family, despite his allegations of mistreatment. David Hale, prosecuting, said photographs of the boy's injuries were taken by a doctor in Ysbyty Gwynedd in 1985 and he was placed on an at risk register. But social services decided they did not have sufficient information to justify removing him from the Roberts' care. The matter only came to light when police, conducting an inquiry into the running of children's homes in North Wales, interviewed the boy last year. Jones, now 19, and living in Holyhead, said Roberts and son, Ian, would hold him upside down, tie his feet with rope or string, and tie it to an overhead pole. It was then he was whipped, he said, which happened three or four times. Roberts would whip him, and his son would watch. But he alleged Ian hit him once or twice. But there were other times that he was whipped while standing up. \\u2018I used to be in agony all the time,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I have still got pains in my back now, and my legs and hands.\\u2019 Defending barrister Thomas Teague accused Paul Jones of making up \\u2018wicked inventions.\\u2019 He said at no time was Paul Jones ever hit with a cane or whip, at no time was he tied upside down and hit, he was never forced to get up early to feed the animals, or ill-treated in any way whatsoever. He would sometimes be slapped with a hand on the bottom, and very occasionally would be given a clip around the ear by Mr Roberts. The case continues. Boy in roof plunge A SCHOOLBOY escaped severe injury last night when he plunged through a skylight and crashed on to a bed. Although the child suffered serious gashes to his hands and arms, emergency services say his injuries could have been a lot worse. The accident occurred last night in the Toxteth district of Liverpool as he and his friends played football. When their ball ended up on the roof of the Bentley Road Health Centre, the 12 year-old clambered up to try to get it. But as the boy scrambled about, he stood on a skylight and fell about 12ft into the room below. The alarm was raised by the boy's friends who called the fire brigade. Station Officer Alan Bridle, from Canning Place's Green Watch, said: \\u2018When we arrived I got up on to the roof and then lowered myself down into the centre. \\u2018The boy was a little shocked and had quite deep gashes but landing on the bed as he did certainly saved him. \\u2018I calmed him down and checked him over and then the ambulance took over.\\u2019 Peru fears revenge of Blackburn vampire A TOWN in Peru is in an uproar over a legend that a Blackburn woman buried there is a vampire who has vowed to return to life tomorrow to seek revenge. Windows, doors and chimneys in the town of Pisco, 125 miles south of Lima, have been festooned with garlic. Radio stations have promised live transmission from the tiny graveyard at midnight, and local police have been mobilised to keep order among sightseers. The focus of the uproar is the tomb of Sarah Helen Roberts from Blackburn, Lancs, who was buried in the local cemetery. Legend has it that Sarah Helen, who died on June 9, 1913, was shut alive inside a lead coffin by British authorities for practising witchcraft, but swore to rise in 80 years to take revenge. For the next four years her relatives reportedly tried to find a country that would receive her body for burial, but were turned away until they reached Peru. Carlos Castro, head of Pisco's main hospital, said pregnant women fear the vampire will reincarnate in their babies. Looking on the bright side, Mayor Edgar Nunez said tourism had jumped by 60pc. Protest over job fears DAVID Hunt was lobbied by trade unionists yesterday when he visited offices where they claim 1,000 jobs are under threat. Union representatives at Castle View House in Runcorn handed a letter to Mr Hunt when he officially opened the new \\u00a315m building. The letter from CPSA secretary Dave Jones called on Mr Hunt to review the \\u2018market testing\\u2019 programme, a form of competitive tendering, which the unions claim is threatening 1,000 of the 1,500 workforce. Mr Jones said: \\u2018He did make reference to the letter in the speech that he made and he did make positive noises but whether they will translate into positive actions we'll have to wait and see.\\u2019 The unions are concerned because they fear that even if the in-house bids for the Civil Service work are successful, jobs could still be lost. The unions involved, the Civil and Public Servants Association and the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, claim that the in-house bids involve jobs losses of up to 50pc as well. The Department of Employment has said that the market testing programme aims to provide the best value for money for the taxpayer. Groom-to-be tells the world By Richard Williams Daily Post Staff A COMPUTER expert gave his girlfriend an olde worlde surprise yesterday when he enlisted the help of a town crier to ask her to marry him. Two weeks ago, Sharon Edwards began teasing Darren Johnson over his lack of romance. But after her 25-year-old boyfriend from Huntington, Chester, popped the question Sharon, 22, admitted she was stunned. Mr Johnson secretly arranged with David Mitchell to ask the crucial question during one of his announcements. So, while out on a shopping trip, Darren stepped forward as a volunteer to help the crier with a proclamation of his own. He bellowed: \\u2018I call upon these persons here present to witness that I, Darren John Johnson, being of sound mind, do ask my beloved Sharon Samantha Edwards, if she will plight her troth unto me?\\u2019 And in front of a crowd of more than 100 cheering tourists, Sharon agreed to his proposal. Deputy town crier Mr Mitchell then announced: \\u2018The lady hath accepted.\\u2019 Sharon, who works at a miniature models factory in Wrexham, said: \\u2018I have been teasing him for about two weeks for not being romantic but he has shown me I was wrong. \\u2018It was a big shock and when I said yes there were about 100 Australian tourists cheering and photographing us.\\u2019 Darren said: \\u2018We are both history lovers so enlisting the town crier's help seemed the ideal way to propose. \\u2018I was glad she accepted because otherwise I would have looked like a right banana in front of all those tourists.\\u2019 Heroin man jailed A KIRKBY man caught with \\u00a3300 worth of heroin has been jailed for two years. Ian Potter, 21, unemployed, of Ascot Drive, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday to possessing the drug with intent to supply. David Owen, prosecuting, told how police officers called at Potter's home on March 16. They were allowed in by his father but then had to break down the locked bedroom door. As well as a bag containing the drug, officers found plastic bags and a knife blade. Potter admitted to police that he had intended selling the drug. John Maxwell, defending, said that Potter, who has no previous drugs convictions, accepted that he would have to go to jail. Probe into OAP death ordered A CORONER yesterday ordered a police investigation after a pensioner died following a car crash near a junction with faulty traffic lights. Alec Lewis, 84, died from a stroke two days after his car was in collision with a bus on Muirhead Avenue, Norris Green, Liverpool. He was rushed to hospital on the day of the crash with his wife Ethel and young granddaughter, both passengers in the car, was released later the same day after receiving three stitches to a head wound. Mrs Lewis told the opening of an inquest at Liverpool Coroners Court that she found her husband hanging half out of bed, frothing at the mouth, two days after the crash. He was rushed from his home in Whinfell Avenue, West Derby, to Broadgreen Hospital where he later died. Merseyside Coroner Roy Barter said he would be holding an inquest after a post mortem revealed head injuries played a part in Mr Lewis's death. And he said he had ordered a police investigation after reports that a set of traffic lights near the scene of the accident were not working. Pigeon rifleman triggers scare By Richard Elias Daily Post Staff ARMED police officers surrounded an office block and sealed off surrounding streets after a man was seen pointing an air rifle from the roof. Evening rush-hour traffic in Liverpool city centre was halted during the alert, in which the gunman was spotted looking through the sights at potential targets. But after noticing all the activity in the streets below, he telephoned Merseyside Police headquarters and sheepishly announced: \\u2018Sorry, I am security guard here and I was just shooting pigeons.\\u2019 The man rang off but was soon contacted by officers from the force's Firearms Unit who ordered him out of the building on Crosshall Street. Last night, a police spokesman said: \\u2018We received reports of a man on the roof aiming a rifle and looking through its sights. \\u2018The Armed Response Vehicles were sent, the place surrounded and the area sealed off.\\u2019 The spokesman added: \\u2018The weapon was being discharged, but he must have noticed what was going on because he rang up saying who he was and apologised. \\u2018He was told to leave his weapon behind and to walk out his hands clearly visible in the air.\\u2019 An air rifle was later recovered from the scene and a man has been reported for summons at a later date. Police probe mill blaze POLICE are investigating the cause of a fire which badly damaged a large mill last night.

Unrestrained folly MANY parents are flouting the rear seat belt law and leaving their children unrestrained in cars, according to the RAC. It is the driver's legal responsibility to ensure that children under 14 are strapped in but spot checks by the RAC showed nearly seven in ten did not comply. Richard Waterhouse, who runs the RAC's Child Safety Campaign, said: \\u2018It only takes a minute to ensure a child is safely strapped in. That minute could literally save a child's life.\\u2019 \\u2018Where belts are fitted they must be used yet I have seen parents taking four or five children on a school run with none restrained.\\u2019 Gunman admits Nazi killing A LONE gunman killed a French Nazi collaborator yesterday, and then went on television to claim responsibility. Christian Didier said he killed Vichy police chief Rene Bousquet with four bullets fired at pointblank range at his Paris home. Hours later Didier summoned television crews to a hotel before being arrested. He said he pretended to be carrying court documents. A court was due to decide whether to send Bousquet for trial. Jewish leaders said the assassination deprived France of a chance to establish the truth about Bousquet's past. UN flies bodies home THE BODIES of 23 peacekeepers shot in weekend battles with Somali gunmen were flown home to Pakistan yesterday as the UN honed plans to hit back at the killers \\u2018within days\\u2019.

Chateau porn fury THE French count who is to marry the Princess of Wales' stepmother, Raine, Countess of Spencer, said yesterday he felt \\u2018totally abused\\u2019 by people who rented his chateau then used it for a porn film. Comte Jean-Francois de Chambrun issued a Press statement after learning of the story when he and his fiancee returned to the Countess's London home. A Sunday newspaper reported that the film team moved into the Chateau Garibondi at Cannes as the Comte and his bride-to-be ended a weekend there, and carried photographs of models cavorting in various parts of the property. Banned driver in car chase with police A BANNED drink-driver led police on a chase around housing estates at speeds of up to 50mph, Warrington magistrates heard yesterday. Christopher Millman then stopped his car and tried to run away, but was soon caught. He was later found to be more than twice the legal drink-drive limit. Millman, 41, of Poplars Avenue, Orford, Warrington pleaded guilty to driving dangerously; with excess alcohol; while disqualified; and without insurance. He was remanded on bail until July 6 for reports. Dennis Tighe, prosecuting said police spotted Millman driving a BMW at about 11.30pm and tried to stop him. Millman accelerated and led police through 30mph housing estates at speeds of up to 50mph. He eventually stopped the car and tried to escape, but was caught by police after a short chase. Frank Howard, defending, said Millman had been drinking to celebrate his birthday and expected his girlfriend to drive him home at the end of the night. He said: \\u2018Mr Millman waited for some time but she failed to arrive and he stupidly decided to drive home himself.\\u2019 Baby freed by firemen after cot ordeal FIREMEN had to release a baby yesterday after her leg became trapped in the bars of her cot. Alexandria Gaunt, aged seven months, was trapped in the cot for more than half an hour as her worried family tried to release her. Firemen eventually managed to untangle the frightened child from the bars by prising them apart. Frantic mother Ashleigh Gaunt had dialled 999 after trying in vain to free her baby herself. But last night Alexandria was safe and sound asleep at home in Holes Lane, Woolston, Warrington. Her mother said: \\u2018My son, who is two and a half, has slept in the cot before with no problems and she has always been alright in it. \\u2018We can't understand how she got stuck. But she was not injured and I'm really grateful to the firemen. \\u2018She is asleep now and has forgotten all about it.\\u2019 Sub officer Jim Clark said: \\u2018It was quite a simple job for us. We were just happy to be able to help.\\u2019 Marquess behind bars after four days on run By Keith Manning and Gavin Cordon THE Marquess of Blandford was behind bars last night after four days on the run from police. As he started a 112-day sentence in London's Pentonville prison for failing to pay more than \\u00a310,000 in maintenance to his estranged wife Becky, the 37-year-old aristocrat also faced new charges of attacking police sent to arrest him. His arrest came just hours after he taunted police, ringing up a national newspaper to say he was the \\u2018new Lord Lucan\\u2019 and would never be caught. The Marquess is heir to the Duke of Marlborough's \\u00a3100m Blenheim estate and the family motto is \\u2018Faithful though Unfortunate\\u2019. He was tracked down early yesterday to a flat in Cathcart Road, Kensington, west London. This is just next door to his old address at No 76, where he managed to evade a High Court Deputy Tipstaff last week after a tip-off from the landlord, apparently by climbing through a back window and shinning down a drainpipe. In the struggle to arrest him yesterday, two policemen were hurt and extra officers had to be called. Neighbour Brian Dean, a 55-year-old chauffeur, said: \\u2018I was woken up by the police cars lining up in the middle of the street. \\u2018I could hear all the banging and screaming and then about seven or eight minutes later they dragged him out. \\u2018He was screaming and shouting abuse.\\u2019 The two officers who went in to arrest the Marquess, Sgt Michael Tate and PC Patrick Murphy, were involved in \\u2018quite a violent struggle\\u2019 with him, said a Metropolitan Police spokesman. The peer, whose ancestors include Sir Winston Churchill and the first Duke of Marlborough, victor of the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, was taken to Kensington police station. After being charged with assaulting the officers, he emerged bruised and dishevelled to be transferred to Pentonville. A police spokesman said Blandford had also been charged with four offences of making off without payment to taxi drivers for amounts ranging between \\u00a311 and \\u00a370.

A police spokesman said: \\u2018As I understand it, he will serve 112 days unless he pays the \\u00a310,000 maintenance.\\u2019 The Marquess, known to friends as Jamie Blandford, married 28-year-old kindergarten teacher and friend of the Duchess of York, Becky Few Brown, in February 1990.

Raiders prey on blind man, 80 By Richard Williams Daily Post Staff A PARTIALLY blind elderly man was tricked by two youths who stole his wallet. Detectives in Northwich yesterday appealed for public help in catching the pair. They said one of the youths kept the frail 80 year old man talking while another sneaked into his house in Forest Street, Weaverham. He searched through the premises with the victim completely unaware that he had slipped inside. The blind man called the police when he realised they had stolen his brown leather wallet. Det Insp Graham Lee, of Northwich CID, said: \\u2018He was a confused old man who was partially sighted. \\u2018It was a cruel crime to carry out and they escaped with \\u00a320. \\u2018This is a timely reminder to people that they should be careful with strangers and if they are leaving their doors open. It is an invitation to thieves.\\u2019 The man has only been able to provide police with sketchy details of the youths but they spoke with Liverpool accents. Det Insp Lee said: \\u2018Despite that they could still be local or from Winsford.\\u2019 He appealed for anyone with information to contact him on . Fears on bedsit fire standards FEARS that city bedsits could become death-traps have been raised, amid reports that the Government is to scrap laws governing them. Chester city councillor, Christine Russell, has slammed the Government after reports that it was planning to abandon laws governing safety in bedsits. After a campaign by councillors, a registration scheme was set up in the Cheyney Road, Garden Lane and Ermine Road areas of the city. Coun Russell said: \\u2018I am horrified that the Government may be planning to scrap the legislation that empowers authorities to inspect register bedsits. \\u2018This scheme has proved extremely useful in putting pressure on private landlords to improve the safety and fitness of their properties.\\u2019 Coun Russell said there had been at least two deaths in bedsit fires in Chester in recent years. \\u2018For the Government to consider scrapping this form of protection for tenants against landlords is a backward step.\\u2019 A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment, said: \\u2018We have been having discussions with the local authority associations.\\u2019 Under the Chester scheme, landlords pay \\u00a350 to register, but if they fail to do so and their houses contain more than the permitted number of occupants, they face fines of up to \\u00a31,000. Holly Park targeted for park-and-ride By Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs Correspondent A FORMER Merseyside football ground, which has been vandalised, could become a railway park and ride site. Holly Park, once the home of South Liverpool FC, has been empty since the club gave up the battle against vandals in 1990. Now the derelict ground is being viewed by Merseytravel as a potential park and ride site. A spokesman for Merseytravel last night confirmed its interest in Holly Park, which is immediately adjacent to Allerton Station. But he stressed that no formal approach had been made for the former football ground. \\u2018It is just one of a number of sites which we are looking at to formulate an extended park and ride system,\\u2019 he said. Liverpool City Council owns the freehold of Holly Park. South Liverpool, formerly in the HFS Loans League, abandoned the ground after 50 years there. Since then the future of Holly Park has been surrounded in controversy. Last year, German-owned Aldi supermarkets withdrew from purchase negotiations after failing to get assurances on its plans for a food store. Care group to discuss problems NESTON Care Group has organised a public meeting on June 15 to look at community problems in the area and to see what positive steps can be taken to help eliminate them. Chairman of the voluntary group, Linda Davies, says she hopes the meeting will not only highlight particular difficulties but also encourage more people to offer help and ideas. The meeting, at Neston Town Hall, will be attended by Police Chief Inspector Vivienne Mills. Training sessions VOLUNTEERS are needed to act as advocates for people with mental health problems. Two training days are planned for June 23 and 30. Anyone interested should contact Kevin McNerney, recently appointed full time advocate with Advocacy in Wirral, on . Site move REDEVELOPMENT plans for the site of the former Orbro store at Bidston Moss will be studied by Wirral plan sub committee tomorrow night. The scheme involves demolition of existing warehouses and replacement with one unit, car parking, a garden centre and service yard. Trust plans WIRRAL Hospital Trust plans alterations and an extension at Clatterbridge Hospital to create a new outpatients department. Man bailed WIRRAL Magistrates bailed Andrew Ashman 24, of Waterpark Close in Prenton for 4 weeks for reports after he admitted entering the locker room at Prenton golf club and stealing a sports bag and contents in May. Car ban JOHN SHACKMAN 44, of Shrewsbury Road, Birkenhead was fined \\u00a3100 and banned from driving for 20 months by Wirral Magistrates when he admitted a drink driving offence. Man guilty after police find stolen bicycles STOLEN cycles were found at the rear of a house when police executed a search warrant, Wirral magistrates heard. Martin Butler, 25, of Woodward Road, Rock Ferry, denied attempting to dishonestly receive the two bikes, which he claims he bought for \\u00a320 from a caller at his door. He was convicted and fined \\u00a340 plus \\u00a365 costs, with 28 days imprisonment if the money was not produced forthwith. Butler also faced the court for non-payment of fines totalling over \\u00a3500. He was told he had been given every opportunity to pay, and was jailed for 32 days. Pipeline hinders work on show By David Banks and David Lloyd A GAS pipeline which cuts across the Cheshire Show field has hindered preparations for the event. Organisers have been forced to cut down on competitors and rent extra land after the British Gas pipeline interfered with their plans. The laying of the pipeline has meant some land at the showground in Tabley, near Knutsford, cannot be used this year. Seven acres of land has been rented to make up for the lost space. There will be no donkeys or coloured and part-bred Welsh ponies at this year's show, which takes place on June 22 and 23. \\u2018The pipeline running from Carrington to Audlem carved a swathe through the northern end of our showground,\\u2019 show vice-chairman Geoff Morris said. \\u2018It was re-seeded but the seed was drowned out last autumn and difficult weather conditions in the spring means that it has to remain fenced off and unusable for this year's show.\\u2019 Joint show secretary Margaret Hollinshead said work on the pipeline had forced them to drop two judging rings for the donkeys and ponies. British Gas would not comment on the matter yesterday. The cost of this year's show has been put at \\u00a3350,000, but admission prices have been kept at \\u00a36 for adults, \\u00a35 for senior citizens and \\u00a33 for children. Almost 60,000 people attended last year's event. Medical centre to open A NEW medical centre which will cater for south Liverpool will be officially opened later this month. The centre in Belle Vale Road, Gateacre, is part of an on-going improvement programme organised by Liverpool Family Health Service Association. The centre will be opened on Saturday, June 26 by Rosemary Hawley, who is chairman of the FHSA. Jewellery theft sparks warning to householders POLICE are urging householders not to leave their front doors open in hot weather after a thief walked into a family home and stole \\u00a31,000 worth of jewellery. The sneak thief walked into the house through an open front door in Rawson Road, Seaforth, Sefton, stealing nine rings. The incident occurred at about noon on Monday. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: \\u2018People should be careful about leaving their doors open in warm weather while they are busy elsewhere in their homes. \\u2018The rings stolen were of great sentimental value to the female owner, included in the haul were wedding and engagement rings.\\u2019 Assault at scene of crash TWO police officers were punched and kicked when they went to investigate a minor road accident, a court heard yesterday. A police car was also damaged during the incident, Warrington Crown Court was told. Darren Grannell, 28, of Lord Street, Latchford, Warrington and Lee Day, 22, formerly of Warrington but now living in Weston-super-Mare, denied assaulting PC Roy Aspinall but changed their pleas to guilty after a trial had started. Grannell also changed his pleas in respect of charges of assaulting PC Eric Moss and damaging a police car. Both were remanded on bail for reports. Sarah Leigh, prosecuting, said the two men were in a car which drove into the rear of a parked car in Reaper Close, Great Sankey. A neighbour saw what happened and notified the car's owner who called the police. PC Aspinall arrived on the scene and saw the two men pushing a car. He started to question them but Grannell \\u2018flew off the handle\\u2019 and attacked him, punching and kicking the officer who fell to the ground. Day also attacked him. PC Moss arrived on the scene and was also punched by Grannell. Grannell was placed in a police car but kicked out the rear window causing \\u00a3150 damage. Both men were taken to the police station where Grannell said he had been drinking and had no recollection of what had happened. Disabled angry at county's plan for means test By Daily Post Correspondent DISABLED people who fail a means test will have to start paying for facilities they have enjoyed free of charge. Users of the Dallam Centre, Warrington, are outraged by proposals to charge up to \\u00a35 a day for use of the facility. Questionnaires issued by Cheshire County Council's social services department asking for financial details of those suffering with physical disabilities, mental illness and learning difficulties will also take away a person's privacy, it is claimed. Wheelchair-bound Ethlyn Whittaker, aged 56, from Great Sankey, Warrington, has started a campaign against the means test forms, and has hit out at the charges set to be introduced in October. \\u2018I don't mind paying for use of the centre, but \\u00a35 for each visit is a bit steep. \\u2018The means testing forms that have been sent out will also take away my privacy. The only thing they don't ask is what time I get up in the morning and what time I go to bed at night. \\u2018I have been told the forms are private and confidential, but by the time you finish filling them in, your whole life is there for someone to see.\\u2019 Mrs Whittaker said she would have to pay up to \\u00a320 a week to continue visiting the centre, as well as \\u00a35 an hour for her own carers. \\u2018I cannot afford these charges,\\u2019 she said. A spokesman for Cheshire County Council's social services department said: \\u2018At present there are many people who do not pay, so they need to be asked to make a contribution to cater for those care needs. \\u2018The means testing forms have to be in such detail so we can work out how much people can afford. \\u2018The system is unfair at the moment, because only a handful are charged.\\u2019 A spokesman for the Warrington Disabled Information Group, based at the Dallam Centre, said: \\u2018People only need to give details they feel comfortable about.\\u2019 People with any queries about means testing can contact the information group on  between 10am-3pm. Father tells of murder girl's last goodbye kiss By Richard Elias Daily Post Staff THE father of murder victim Jean Larkin told of how he kissed her goodnight during their last moments together. And yesterday, Kevin Larkin revealed how he and his family are attempting to cope with their loss. Speaking at a news conference at Merseyside Police headquarters in Liverpool, he said: \\u2018Unfortunately at this time all I can feel is angry. My stomach has been turning over ever since this began. It is like a nightmare that will never end. \\u2018I am desperate to find out exactly what happened to her and Garry. We thought Jean might have been with Garry in the fire but there is no evidence to suggest that she is there now.\\u2019 Mr Larkin, 54, added: \\u2018Really now, I am wondering whether she has been buried somewhere. But I really just do not know.\\u2019 He told how she and Garry used to call round to his house ever Sunday for lunch. Mr Larkin said: \\u2018When she was leaving she always used to come and kiss both me and her mother goodbye although she was 24 years old. That was the type of girl she was.\\u2019 The last time Mr Larkin saw his daughter was as she talked to her mother, Kay, about knitting and crochet at Mr Larkin's home in Alderfield Road, Speke. He said: \\u2018I asked her to drop me off at the nearby Woodcutters Club. Although it was late she did this, kissed me goodnight and that was the last I saw of ever her.\\u2019 One of the detectives in charge of the inquiry, Det Insp Ray Wareham said the hunt had now moved to a new location. He said: \\u2018We are looking at Yarrow Country Park between Chorley and Coppull where underwater search unit officers have been brought in to help. \\u2018We are also searching the adjoining land and the car park in the area for any trace of Jean.\\u2019 The remains of Jean's boyfriend, Garry Pettitt have been discovered near Coppull, Chorley. The results of DNA tests have not been received yet. Detectives believe the pair were murdered when a drugs deal which Mr Pettitt was involved in went tragically wrong. The couple from south Liverpool disappeared on April 27. Gary Pettitt and Jean Larkin Kevin Larkin a nightmare that will never end \\u2018Air route will ruin peaceful park\\u2019 NOISE from aircraft using a proposed new flightpath over Tatton Park may drive up to 80pc of visitors away and leave it financially crippled, it was claimed yesterday. At a meeting on Friday, park managers will meet Cheshire councillors to discuss the implications of the proposed new route into Manchester Airport. They want compensation from Manchester Airport for money they predict will be lost from visitor revenue. They want the flightpath moved one mile to the west. Tatton Park director Mike Beaufoy said: \\u2018Income comes to the estate from visitor admissions, open air events, concerts and filming in the open air these are all affected by aircraft flying over the estate. \\u2018Great numbers of visitors come to Tatton from urban areas. They see Tatton as their nearest open space for recreation. \\u2018Reduction in the perceived peace and tranquillity will reduce the attractiveness at Tatton to 80pc of its visitors, thus having a major effect on visitor income and support for the estate.\\u2019 Tranquil Tatton but will a new airport flightpath shatter this idyllic rural scene and drive tourists away? Light at end of the tunnel By Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs Correspondent MERSEY Tunnel officials were last night welcoming increased business and faster traffic flows. Following a year when toll increases from 60p to \\u00a31 and the recession slashed use of both tunnels by a million vehicles, business has begun to boom. Traffic through the Mersey tunnels was down 4.9pc in the year ending in April but a spokesman said indications were that it had regained 3pc of that business in the first few months of this year. Officials are particularly pleased at the success of the new Fast-tag electronic payment system. \\u2018We are expecting to record our millionth Fast-tag customer within the next few weeks,\\u2019 said Jeremy Herbert for Merseytravel. Figures out yesterday show that the tunnels were now breaking even. It had been feared that if the impact of the recession and resistance to the toll increase had exceeded 10pc motorists faced another price rise. Merseytravel finance director John Wilkinson said he did not now expect another toll increase to be even considered for another 12 months. The company needs to raise \\u00a324m \\u00a38m to cover running costs and \\u00a316m to finance the \\u00a3110m debt. Mr Wilkinsion said he was pleasantly surprised that the loss of traffic had not been as bad as feared. \\u2018It does appear traffic is still returning to the tunnels,\\u2019 he added. Merseytravel is convinced that increased use of the Fast-tag system will mean more efficient traffic flows. Arsonists escape school inferno FIRE-FIGHTERS risked their lives yesterday searching for two suspected young arsonists believed to be trapped inside a blazing school building. The blaze caused extensive damage at the disused English Martyrs High School at Orford, Warrington scene of numerous fires and acts of vandalism in recent months. Firemen wearing breathing apparatus searched the buildings for more than hour But two youths, believed to have started the fire, had disappeared. A Fire Service spokesman said: \\u2018We were told from a reliable source the youths were still likely to be in the building so we conducted a thorough search. But they must have got out somehow. \\u2018They were very lucky not to have been hurt.\\u2019 Local residents are campaigning for urgent action to stop the repeated fires at the semi-derelict school which closed only about two years ago. Treaty enemies firm in debate THE Maastricht Treaty Bill was set to gain its second reading in the Lords early today after a marathon two day debate which saw Margaret Thatcher lead a head on clash with Mr Major over her call for a referendum. Baroness Thatcher's demand was to be reinforced by her former Cabinet lieutenant, Lord Tebbit, as the debate drew to a close. The bitterness of Maastricht opponents who also included Tory ex-minister Lord Parkinson and former Commons Speaker Viscount Tonypandy signalled that the European Communities (Amendment) Bill is set for a gruelling passage, despite it being given an unopposed second reading. Lady Thatcher told peers yesterday that it would be \\u2018disgraceful\\u2019 if British voters were denied a say on Maastricht. The former Prime Minister added: \\u2018I personally could never have signed this treaty.\\u2019 Not to allow voters a referendum in Britain would be to \\u2018betray the trust\\u2026they have placed in us\\u2019. Lords Leader Lord Wakeham said: \\u2018Those who find the arguments attractive in this case might\\u2026contribute to undermining the very system of parliamentary democracy it is their professed aim to protect.\\u2019 Labour ex-Cabinet minister Lord Healey warned: \\u2018Lady Thatcher's type of nationalism is the greatest single danger to peace in the modern world, and Mr Major's failure to confront it head-on as such a danger has made a civil war in the government party a danger to Britain and to Europe as whole.\\u2019 Lord Tebbit Cash plea to fight lung cancer Surgeon tries to stop mass killer By Jane Gallagher LEADING lung cancer specialist Ray Donnelly has called for more cash to wipe out the disease which kills 1,600 Merseysiders every year. Mr Donnelly, consultant surgeon at Liverpool's Cardiothoracic Centre, has told of his hopes for a three-year study to find out why Merseyside has become the lung cancer capital of the world. Speaking at the launch of the Southport and Formby Lung Cancer Support Group last night, Mr Donelly said: \\u2018In Liverpool, lung cancer in women is 125% above the national average. \\u2018I don't believe people here smoke 125% more cigarettes and in fact two in 10 people who contract lung cancer do not smoke. \\u2018Maybe the influencing factors are genetic, occupational, stress, environmental, we need to examine these more closely.\\u2019 The study, to be carried out by Liverpool University, will cost more than \\u00a3300,000. Mr Donnelly added: \\u2018We need cash to fund this research and develop screening and better treatments. \\u2018The treatments for lung cancer today are no better that they were when King George VI died of the disease 40 years ago. \\u2018Lung cancer does not respect person or class. \\u2018We need money to eradicate this scourge from our society so that our children and our grandchildren are not presented with the awful statistics we are presented with today.\\u2019 Colin and Pam Lawrence, parents of air hostess Nicola Lawrence who died of the disease in February, aged 25, endorsed Mr Donnelly's appeal. Mr Lawrence, of Aughton, near Ormskirk, said: \\u2018Our daughter never smoked a cigarette in her life yet she contracted the disease. \\u2018We would like to lend our support to the appeal because we would like to help prevent this happening to other families in the future.\\u2019 Lung cancer survivor Bernard Maxwell, from Blundellsands, stressed the importance of support groups. Bernard, 51, said: \\u2018When you are told you have lung cancer, it is shattering. \\u2018I survived but I have joined the group because I want to put something back raising money and proving to others that you can survive.\\u2019 Ray Donnelly \\u2026cash plea P. 1 lead EXCLUSIVE by Caroline Storah, crime reporter THE heartbroken father of Liverpool girl Jean Larkin killed in a gruesome double murder said today: \\u2018How could they do this to our beautiful daughter?\\u2019 Speaking for the first time since the tragedy Kevin Larkin told the Echo: \\u2018Jean was young and innocent. Even members of the underworld who have been in contact with me are outraged at her murder.\\u2019 Jean, 24, was killed with her boyfriend Gary Pettitt, 25, after they disappeared from their home in Aigburth. Their bodies were burned in a desolate Lancashire beauty spot near Chorley. Police believe Gary may have been caught up in the world of drugs and met his death as a result. But Jean, say detectives, was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mr Larkin said: \\u2018We have learned that even among criminals there are rules and in this case, by killing Jean, they have broken them. \\u2018Even hardened criminals do not harm wives and girlfriends, so we have been told. \\u2018That is why they have blown the gaffe and been tipping off the police. \\u2018They say if Jean had stayed in that night and washed her hair then she would be alive today.\\u2019 Mr Larkin was opening his heart after making a trip to the woodlands in Coppull, near Chorley, where the couple met their deaths. Mr Larkin said: \\u2018Jean's was a young, innocent life taken away in a horrible way. She led a good life. \\u2018She would never have been caught up in anything to do with drugs. Dream \\u2018She and Gary had everything to live for and were working to get married for a life together. \\u2018Now that dream has gone and our lives are in tatters. \\u2018I doubt we shall ever be the same again.\\u2019 Mr Larkin says his suffering is worse for knowing that Gary had only agreed to go to Chorley at the last minute after two people, a man and a woman, had spoken separately to him on the phone. Persuaded He said: \\u2018The police have told us he was very reluctant to go at first. \\u2018But they say a woman finally persuaded him and he took Jean with him. \\u2018We keep thinking \\u2018If only they hadn't\\u2019. \\u2018It would have been just like Jean to have gone along for the journey.\\u2019 Mr Larkin is haunted by memories of a visit he made to the secluded woods at along with Marie Pettitt, Gary's mother. Mr Larkin's wife Kay was unable to make the journey on medical grounds. She has hardly slept since the couple vanished six weeks ago. Secret Mr Larkin said: \\u2018I wanted to the see the place for myself. I thought it might help, but it hasn't. \\u2018It is a terrible place with a terrible secret.\\u2019 Forensic tests have revealed teeth found in the debris of a massive fire were Gary's and murder squad detectives are still waiting for scientists to formally identify Jean's remains. Detectives have seized 7,000 ecstasy tablets from a flat in the North-East and are linking that to the couple' disappearance. They say they have only tenuous evidence Gary might have been involved in drugs. Gary and Jean left their flat in Jericho Farm Walk, Aigburth, on April 27. Their van was found at Manchester Airport the following day and the couple were never seen again. Support Both families are staying close, supporting each other through their ordeal. Mr Larkin added: \\u2018Jean would never have got mixed up in anything criminal and I can't believe Gary was involved either. \\u2018I believe if he was into drugs it was the first time. \\u2018They never had any money. They were always borrowing money, even for cigarettes. \\u2018Everything they did was for their business. \\u2018He worked all hours trying to build it up. He started early and finished late. \\u2018We thought the world of him and just can't believe he was involved. Gary was a hard-working lad just trying to make ends meet.\\u2019 Mr Larkin says he has learned from the criminal underworld about the events on the night of April 27. Beautiful \\u2018I just don't know how anyone can do this to anyone else. People sometimes say they bear no malice but I do not know how they can say that. \\u2018Jean was beautiful. Whoever killed her will be sent to prison. But at the end of the day they have a life. \\u2018My daughter's has gone forever.\\u2019 From Page One. Turn to Page 44.

Carpet mogul is back in business SIR Phil Harris, one of the stock market stars of the 1980s, makes a dramatic comeback this month, having increased the value of his stake in his new venture Carpetright from \\u00a33m to about \\u00a330m. It is the second fortune he has made from the carpet-retailing business, after being forced out of his Harris Queensway chain nearly five years ago. Carpetright is to float with a price tag of \\u00a3113.6m at 148p a share in a move which will enable another major investor, the MFI furniture group, to raise a total of \\u00a321.7m which will be used to cut debt. Some 35% of Carpetright is for sale, of which 10% is being reserved for employees and directors. Sir Phil, who walked away with about \\u00a370m from the takeover of Harris Queensway, has built Carpetright into one of Britain's leading carpet retailers. He has nearly 29% of the company, but that will be reduced to just under 21% on flotation. Loser\\u2026shrug of defeat as Woody Allen faces the press Mia Farrow\\u2026savouring victory Foster care boy \\u2018beaten and starved\\u2019 FOSTER father Norman Roberts took a horse whip and bamboo stick to a boy placed in his care by a council's social services department, it was alleged today. The boy was tied with a rope by his feet, hauled over a beam in a barn at the North Wales farm where they lived, then beaten, it was claimed at Mold Crown Court. Roberts\\u2019 son Ian would also join in the beatings, it was alleged. The boy, Paul Llewelyn Jones, was also starved of food by Roberts' wife Evelyn and given dog biscuits as a punishment, the jury heard. He would beg food from other children in school, eat their apple cores and even scoured bins for food, prosecuting barrister David Hale told the jury. Police were not aware of the allegations for six years. But photographs found by police in the files of Gwynedd County Council's social services department last year showed the child had been beaten, it was alleged. Internal investigations were made by social services and Paul Llewelyn Jones was put on the \\u2018at risk\\u2019 register. A special case conference was held in 1986 because he was not thriving as he should have done. But he was left with the Roberts family, the social services department considering there was insufficient justification to remove him. Norman Roberts, 59, of Ysgubor Esgob, Gwalchmai on Anglesey, denies cruelty. His wife Evelyn, 59, of the same address, denies wilful neglect by allegedly failing to provide the boy with sufficient nourishment. Norman Roberts is also charged with assaulting the child. All allegations are between 1980 and 1985. Their son Ian Roberts, 34, is charged with common assault on the boy in September 1985. Their alleged victim, now 19, of Holyhead, was fostered by the Roberts from six to 12. (Proceeding). Mersey Ferries probe urged By Vic Gibson A TOP-LEVEL inquiry was demanded today into claims that the world-famous Mersey Ferries are heading for closure. The call came from trade union leaders representing the ferries' 103-strong workforce. The renewed concern follows a \\u00a36 million investment by Merseytravel to revamp the loss-making ferries in 1990. Mersey Ferries general manager Ian Thompson said: \\u2018I would welcome an inquiry in the interests of both Mersey Ferries and Merseytravel. \\u2018My deepest concern is that the future of the ferry service itself may be in jeopardy, particularly as a result of the way in which \\u00a36 million was invested in the operation in 1990.\\u2019 Half the sum was spent improving the Mountwood and Woodchurch vessels. The other \\u00a33 million was spent on the three ferry terminals. Merseytravel, which operates the boats, strongly denies that it is steering them towards closure. But Wallasey MP Angela Eagle said today that she is to raise the matter in Parliament. Merseytravel has already announced plans to close the Seacombe terminal. Campaigners, backed by Ms Eagle, say the landing stage could be repaired for as little as \\u00a31.5 million instead of the \\u00a310 million being quoted by Merseytravel. They also complain that bus services to the closure-threatened terminal have deliberately been diminished. The ferries' board of directors meets tomorrow. A Merseytravel spokesman said: \\u2018We are determined to retain the ferries as part of Merseytravel's future. We have nothing more to add before Wednesday's meeting.\\u2019 Patten attack on teachers By Maria McGeoghan EDUCATION Secretary John Patten launched another attack on teachers today, hours after the start of massive boycott of tests for 14-year-olds. Mr Patten was speaking at a Newspapers In Education conference in Bristol, which is looking at ways of getting children involved with their local paper at an early age. He told the ECHO that he thought the teachers' action which has left thousands of exam papers unopened, was a \\u2018great tragedy\\u2019. He said: \\u2018It is very sad indeed that there is any industrial action in any of our schools. \\u2018I don't think it is a professional approach. It is a tragedy that many children have been denied the chance to take these tests. \\u2018Professionals don't take such action. It is a great pity that they feel this is the right course of action to take.\\u2019 It was revealed today that the tests included a passage by Liverpool writer Helen Forrester on a Mersey ferry trip aimed at spending a day away from the city's \\u2018heavily polluted air\\u2019. The exam was sent out to thousands of schools as part of the government's testing scheme for youngsters. But the test was sat by only a handful of pupils because of a boycott by teaching unions. The piece, from her book \\u2018Liverpool Miss\\u2019, was used for a test of reading and writing. The passage includes a section with the words: \\u2018The floating pier was always packed with people, anxious to spend a day away from Liverpool's heavily polluted air.\\u2019 A Merseytravel spokesman said: \\u2018This sounds like a work of fiction and should be treated as such.\\u2019 \\u2018Ecstasy worth \\u00a31m in city flat\\u2019 DETECTIVES found more than \\u00a31m worth of ecstasy in a Liverpool flat, a court was told. Ian Ainsworth, 24, of Acrefield Road, Woolton, denies possessing the drug with intent to supply. Christopher Cornwall, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that police went to Ainsworth's ground floor flat last October. In the cellar, which could be reached only from his flat, they found five holdalls containing plastic bags with 118,000 ecstasy tablets, it was alleged. They also found a piece of paper with the radio frequencies used by police locally and nationally, said Mr Cornwall. Water costs level out ANGLIAN Water says market research has shown its customers would be willing to pay more in return for improved standards.

Man dies, 14 injured, in attack on tourist bus BRITONS IN BOMB RAID AT PYRAMIDS By Echo reporter AT LEAST one man was killed and five British tourists were among 14 people injured when a man threw a bomb at a tour bus on the road to the Pyramids in Cairo today. The attack was blamed on Muslim militants who have waged a campaign of violence for more than a year to overthrow the government and turn Egypt into a purist Islamic state. Windows Witnesses said the bus, carrying 49 Britons on a day trip from Cyprus, was driving through an underpass on the main road leading to the Pyramids of Giza when a man dropped the bomb from a bridge above. It wrecked a Mercedes-Benz car driving in front of the bus and blew out the windows of the bus, which then crashed into the back of the Mercedes. Four other cars and a motorcycle were caught in the mayhem. Cairo's interior ministry said an Egyptian man had been killed and nine Egyptians and five British tourists had been injured. Two Egyptians, including the tour bus guide, were in a serious condition. Doctors at a nearby hospital said four of the five Britons had only slight wounds but one man had an operation to remove a nail embedded in his chest. Another report said one of the holidaymakers suffered a serious eye injury caused by flying glass. More than 130 people, mostly Egyptian militants and police, have died in political violence in Egypt over the last 14 months. A British nurse, Sharon Hill from Gloucester, a Swede and a Turk were killed in previous terror attacks on tourists. But a massive security campaign pushed militants deeper underground and until today appeared to have stopped attacks on foreigners. John Cook, 45, said after being treated for a cut on the head: \\u2018We heard an explosion. The bus moved quickly. \\u2018We don't know what happened afterwards. We came to the hospital and got medical treatment and you can see that we are all right.\\u2019 A taxi driver driving behind the bus said: \\u2018I heard a big explosion just as the tourist bus was passing. \\u2018I saw grey smoke and then the tourist bus moved away fast.\\u2019 Tourist attraction\\u2026the Sphinx and pyramids at Giza P.2 Ferries Probe is demanded over ferries \\u2018closure\\u2019 By Vic Gibson A TOP-LEVEL inquiry was demanded today into claims that the world-famous Mersey Ferries are heading for closure. The call came from trade union leaders representing the ferries\\u2019 103-strong workforce. The renewed concern follows a \\u00a36m investment by Merseytravel to revamp the loss-making ferries in 1990. Mersey Ferries general manager Ian Thompson said: \\u2018I would welcome an inquiry in the interests of both Mersey Ferries and Merseytravel. \\u2018My deepest concern is that the future of the ferry service itself may be in jeopardy, particularly as a result of the way in which \\u00a36 million was invested in the operation in 1990.\\u2019 Half was spent improving the Mountwood and Woodchurch vessels. The other \\u00a33m was used on the three ferry terminals. Merseytravel, which operates the boats, strongly denies that it is steering them towards closure. But Wallasey MP Angela Eagle said today that she is to raise the matter in Parliament. Merseytravel has already announced plans to close the Seacombe terminal. Campaigners, backed by Ms Eagle, say the landing stage could be repaired for \\u00a31.5m instead of the \\u00a310m quoted by Merseytravel. A Merseytravel spokesman insisted: \\u2018We are determined to retain the ferries as part of Merseytravel's future.\\u2019 A former Liverpool union official was jailed today for stealing \\u00a33,000 from a fund to help grieving families.

Down 0.7 at 2223.7 SE-100 up 0.5 at 2845.3 Down to 1.5150 dollars Down to 2.4607 marks Clinton fears affecting drug companies' shares WHY are shares lagging behind in Britain? The Footsie 100 Index of the Top 100 shares has more or less stood still this year. Yet on Wall Street shares are up by 7pc, Japanese shares have gone up 19pc and in Europe the share index has risen by 9pc. The truth is that the Footsie is proving to be a misleading guide to what is really happening in the market. Beneath the surface of the index there is much turmoil, with some shares zooming ahead. For example British Aerospace has more than doubled to 375p this year. There has also been a huge recovery of confidence in construction material shares as RMC and Redland, although my favourite remains Blue Circle at 250p because of its involvement in the home improvement business through Armitage Shanks. Fears On the other hand what is holding the Index back is the drug companies. These now comprise 10pc of the total index but are under a cloud because of fears about US President's wife Hillary Clinton, who is expected to stamp on their profits hard when her review of the US health scene comes out later this year. So Glaxo shares are down from \\u00a38 to under \\u00a36 and Wellcome down from \\u00a310 to \\u00a37.50. Other drug shares have also fallen, so the Footsie Index is giving a misleading impression as to the underlying strength of the market. One share that comes out of this situation well is \\u2018born-again' ICI at 690p. Not only has it hived-off its drug side into Zeneca but also, unlike most chemical companies, it is coming out of the recession with no cash worries as the rights issue for the Zeneca shares will pay off most of its debt. Old and new join forces in print By David Hope Business Staff ONE of Merseyside's oldest printing firms has joined forces with one of the region's newest. Four-year-old Final Film of Birkenhead and the long established north west market leader Rockcliffe Printing Group at Aintree, bring together the former's high tech colour production service and the latter's high volume capability to service large corporate bodies. Final Film's managing director, Peter Stevens predicts that by bringing together their allied skills, technology, advice and consultancy they will offer a service, \\u2018second to none\\u2019. \\u2018I am tremendously excited about the whole project, I can see a rewarding and profitable future. It has a multimillion pound potential, it will rattle the industry,\\u2019 said Mr Stevens. Managing Director of Rockcliffe, Graham Campbell said,\\u2019 We are not just going with the trend, we are about to overtake it.\\u2019 Both firms have invested heavily in hi-tech applications and are running a double shift. Mr Stevens forecasts success will lead to a treble shift round the clock working and the creation of six or seven new jobs for both companies. Final Film are to the fore in the conversion of Apple Mac graphics to colour film for brochure work and run a fully integrated Crosfield colour reproduction installation, which now complements Rockcliffe' high volume Hiedelberg presses. In addition Final Film are introducing BT's International System Digital Network, a hi-speed data transfer system which allows design work to be sent from the computer screen down a landline. Both already boast a prestige client list,\\u2019 a whole raft of serious clients\\u2019, said Mr Stevens. Rockcliffe does work for Pilkingtons, National Giro, the Alliance and Leicester, Paramount and produces Liverpool Football Club programmes. Final Film have contracts with the Cheshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire Life magazine group and produce catalogues for many top firms, including Gault Toys, Matthews Office Furniture, international Arabian oil giants Aramco and the International Marine Business law magazine. At the beginning of June the companies began marketing themselves as a \\u2018total service\\u2019 to corporate clients, a one-stop-shop for print buyers from desk top to finished brochure. Murder protest to envoy By Daily Post Correspondent THE parents of murdered schoolteacher Fiona Jones want to meet the French Ambassador to tell him about their dissatisfaction with the result of the recent trial. Rod Richards, Tory MP for Clwyd North West, yesterday wrote to the Ambassador requesting the meeting, at which he also wishes to be present. Bruce and Pat Cottrill, of Colwyn Bay, are furious that killer Frederic Blancke has been jailed for only 15 years, which means he could be free before the end of the century. They want to tell the Ambassador they are unhappy about the trial, the fact that the jury found there was no premeditation, and their fear that the court could have been influenced because their daughter was not of French nationality. They also want to know whether the French Government will take any action. Mr Richards has also met Foreign Office minister Mark Lennox-Boyd to discuss the case. The MP said yesterday: \\u2018I agree with the family entirely that the punishment does not fit the crime. Had it happened in Britain there would have been uproar if the judge hadn't recommended a minimum of 20 years in jail for such a case.\\u2019 Mrs Cottrill, 56, said:\\u2019 We wonder whether the verdict would have been the same had Fiona been French.\\u2019 \\u2018Human fireball\\u2019 man died in Bosnia protest By Daily Post Correspondent A MAN turned himself into a human fireball as a protest against Western inaction in Bosnia, an inquest heard yesterday. Graham Bamford, 48, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, emptied a can of petrol over himself, flicked a lighter and exploded in flames in London's Parliament Square as MPs in the nearby House of Commons debated the Bosnia crisis on April 29. Horrified witnesses watched helplessly as the blazing man staggered around the square before collapsing. He was taken by air ambulance to the Queen Mary's Hospital burns unit in Roehampton, London, but died later from burns to 80pc of his body. Police found a book beside the empty petrol can containing the word \\u2018Sarajevo\\u2019 and a message from Mr Bamford expressing frustration with events in Bosnia and lack of action by politicians. Coroner Dr Paul Knapman said at Westminster Coroner's Court: \\u2018He was concerned about the events in Bosnia and the lack of action by politicians in the West. \\u2018He has taken his own life in a dramatic gesture which some have described as futile.\\u2019 The coroner's verdict was that Mr Bamford killed himself and died from shock due to burns. The inquest heard that Mr Bamford taught English in Japan where he met his wife, Tumiko. The couple married when they returned to England and Mr Bamford started a new business as a haulage contractor. But his business folded, and his wife went back to Japan. His father, George Bamford, a retired architect, told the inquest: \\u2018He felt strongly about the events in Bosnia.\\u2019 Despite unemployment and money worries, he made two donations of \\u00a3250 and \\u00a3100 to Christian Aid and sympathised with victims of Serbian cruelty in Bosnia. PM defends national curriculum tests NATIONAL curriculum tests were \\u2018very much in the interests\\u2019 of schoolchildren, the Prime Minister told MPs yesterday. John Major was speaking in the Commons in the wake of Monday's boycott, which left the Government's English reading and writing test for 14-year-olds in tatters. And teachers were poised to resume their attack with a boycott of today's English literature and essay papers. Almost all schools are expected to abandon the tests in the face of the boycott by members of the National Association of Schoolmasters-Union of Women Teachers, National Union of Teachers and Association of Teachers and Lecturers. Mr Major spoke out during Prime Minister's question time when MP John Carlisle (C Luton N) raised the case of a headteacher who, after being awarded a salary increase, had written to Education Secretary John Patten \\u2018telling him he could stuff his pay rise\\u2019. The Prime Minister replied: \\u2018It is an unusual position to take about pay rises. I do regret very much that there is difficulty in carrying these tests forward. \\u2018They are very much in the interests of the children.\\u2019 Peer faces 15 hours a day \\u2018banged up\\u2019 in cell By Gavin Cordon Daily Post Correspondent THE Marquess of Blandford can expect little in the way of special treatment at Pentonville Prison. His sentence is for a civil matter, so he is entitled to certain privileges denied to inmates convicted of criminal offences. But he will still probably spend 15 hours a day or more \\u2018banged up\\u2019 in his cell in the 150-year-old Victorian jail. His first taste of his new regime came yesterday morning at \\u2018reception\\u2019 when his warrant was checked and his clothes and possessions logged and stored. After a short shower, he was given a fresh set of prison clothes and marched off to his cell. His first two days are likely to be spent on the induction wing while he is assessed by prison staff, before being allocated a permanent cell. The prison population at Pentonville has been cut sharply in recent years, from more than 1,000 to about 600, and most inmates now have their own cells. Because the 37-year-old peer is a civil prisoner, there is also a good chance he will be allocated to the jail's C wing, where the cells have their own lavatories and wash basins, saving him the indignity of \\u2018slopping out\\u2019. His civil status also means he can choose whether or not he wants to work during his sentence. The jobs on offer cleaning, gardening, helping in the kitchen or the tailoring workshop seem unlikely to appeal to his aristocratic tastes. The alternative, however, is to spend most of his time in his cell. The Marquess's treatment at the hands of his fellow inmates will depend very much on his own attitude. \\u2018He is coming in here as a well-known figure. There's no way they're not going to have heard of him so it all depends on how he reacts to the other prisoners,\\u2019 one prison source said. Pentonville Prison no special treatment for the Marquess by KEN MATTHEWS in Llandudno CHRIS LILLYWHITE of the British professional Banana team recovered from a crash to regain the yellow jersey of race leader as the Milk Race ended its longest stage of 125 miles from Birmingham to Llandudno yesterday. Lillywhite's team-mate Brian Smith moved up to second place overall, 38 seconds behind, and Irishman Conor Henry, who was a shock winner last year, is in third spot overall at 41 seconds. Escaped The winner of stage eight was the Australian, Patrick Jonker, who escaped from the leading break of 13 riders with a mile to go and came in 12 seconds ahead in a time of 4 hours 40 minutes 45 seconds for the 125 miles. The leading bunch was led in for second place by Jacek Mickiewicz of Poland with another Australian, Grant Rice, third. Lillywhite was fourth and Smith ninth but in the same time as the second placed man, ensuring them the top two places overall. Lillywhite recovered after crashing just after the Horseshoe Pass climb at Llangollen at 73 miles though it had not been all plain sailing for the Banana team. Ben Luckwell, previously third overall behind Belgian amateur Nico Mattan and Lillywhite, finished among the last group of riders along with team-mate Shane Sutton, the 1990 Milk Race winner who suffered badly bruised ribs in a crash at Milton Keynes last week. Break Mattan, who had taken over the yellow jersey from Lillywhite in Leicester on Saturday, started yesterday 33 seconds ahead of Lillywhite but had dropped to fourth place overall by the end of the day. The main field was led in by Miles Erzen of Slovenia one minute and 30 seconds behind the leading pack, with another 42 riders in the same time. Early in the day there was a break of eleven riders who were joined by another five and the group gained an advantage of nearly four minutes. In that early break was Rob Holden of the Neilson-Tivoli professional team (GB). When they got to the Horseshoe Pass, where most of the Merseyside fans chose to watch, the break fell apart but Holden went on to win the special prime (SIC) 30 seconds ahead of the rest. By that point the leading group contained 22 riders with an advantage of 2 mins 20 sec over the main field. Holden was caught at Ruthin. A total of 94 riders remain in the race with four stages to go.Two dropped out yesterday, Australian Rob McLachlan submitting to flu and South African Steven Wolhuter being admitted to Shrewsbury Hospital for a check-up though he was released later. Today's stage nine is 120 miles from Wrexham to Rotherham and the Milk Race comes to Liverpool city centre tomorrow, the first riders set to arrive at around 2.30pm. finishing line for the stage is situated at the top of the cobbled William Brown Street. HOT PURSUIT: The Milk Race speeds into Llandudno with Patrick Jonker the jubilant stage winner Lib-Dems split on abortion is healed LIBERAL Democrat leaders have healed a party rift over abortion which threatened the desertion of hundreds of members and the walk out of one MP. To the relief of leader Paddy Ashdown, Liverpool Mossley Hill MP, David Alton, said yesterday there was now no obstacle to his standing again at the next General Election. Last autumn, Mr Alton threatened to quit or even stand as an independent after the party's Harrogate conference endorsed a strong pro-abortion line. But two weeks ago the Liberal Democrats reversed their policy at their spring conference in Nottingham, making clear that abortion was a matter for the individual conscience. Hundreds of members of the 100,000-strong party backed Mr Alton and threatened to sever their links with the party. Mr Alton, a Catholic and a leading campaigner for reforming the abortion law, told the Daily Post: \\u2018The way is open for me to stand. My constituency association supported me 100pc.\\u2019 Mr Ashdown said: \\u2018I am delighted with the sensible decision taken by our spring conference and David's statement.\\u2019 Fears for missing woman POLICE are becoming increasingly concerned about the welfare of a 30-year-old woman who walked out of a hospital two weeks ago and has not been seen since. And they believe Diane Wright may be in the Aberystwyth area. Dyfed Powys police have been alerted. Miss Wright, of The Greenway, Dovecote, Liverpool, was being treated for anorexia at Broadgreen Hospital, and a Merseyside police spokesman said last night the family were concerned about her safety. Walked out \\u2019 Miss Wright simply walked out of the hospital at 2pm on Sunday, May 23, and has not been seen since. But we believe she could be in the Aberystwyth area,\\u2019 said the spokesman. Miss Wright is described as 5ft 1ins tall, of very slight build with short dark-brown hair and blue eyes. She was wearing grey jogging bottoms, a lilac floral sweatshirt, white trainers and a long navy-blue overcoat when last seen in hospital. \\u2018She spent a lot of time in her younger days in Aberystwyth. She has said more than once it was her favourite haunt,\\u2019 said the spokesman. Diane Wright Fit Princess rejects run-of-mill offer By Joe Quinn and John Clarke THE Princess of Wales yesterday turned down an invitation to try out a hospital treadmill saying she was much too fit already. She was visiting Glasgow's Western Infirmary to learn about pioneering work to find new ways to treat asthma. During a tour, the Princess watched patients exercising on treadmills to measure their lung functions. But she declined an offer to go on the treadmill herself, telling patients: \\u2018No thank you. I would embarrass you I do it regularly at home.\\u2019 Earlier the Princess, who is the patron of the International Spinal Research Trust, visited Scotland's national spinal-injury unit in the city, where exercise also has key role in treating patients. Alan Murphy, 25, from Alexandria, Strathclyde, told the Princess he was exercising to put on weight as he had lost six stones after breaking his back in a car crash. She watched him working out on an exercise bike and said: \\u2018There's nothing wrong with slim people.\\u2019 The Princess was at the unit to launch a new leaflet aimed at raising cash to pay for research into cures for paralysis. Afterwards she visited the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons and was told surgeons there will soon be able to practise their skills using virtual-reality equipment. She opened a conference centre named after her and was given a glimpse into the future with a demonstration of the latest keyhole surgery. Later she received a good luck token when she went on a walkabout in Glasgow's George Square. A Mary Queen of Scots coin was given to her by well-wisher Jessie Brown, 40, of South Carntyne, Glasgow. \\u2018I gave the coin to the princess as a memento,\\u2019 said Ms Brown. \\u2018It brought me a lot of luck and I hope it brings her just as much.\\u2019 Princess Diana tells patient Alan Murphy; \\u2018There's nothing wrong with slim people\\u2019 Threatened grant aid creates jobs Clwyd factory beats off foreign rivals to expansion package By David Jones Daily Post Staff A CLWYD company is to expand with the creation of 38 new jobs. But the project could have been lost to overseas had it not been for grant aid from the Welsh Office. The \\u00a32.8m expansion at Wrexham Wire Company will involve the construction of a 45,000 sq ft factory close to the firm's existing plant which employs 92 people on the town's industrial estate. Six new wire-drawing machines and a new cleaning line will be added to the present six machines. The company, a subsidiary of the Caparo Group, produces high-quality steel wire for fasteners and for the furniture industry. Work on the project will start shortly and the company expects to start production at the new facility early next year. Most of the new product will be exported. A Wrexham Maelor Council spokeswoman said the importance of grant aid in securing the project underlined how crucial it was that the borough retain its assisted-area status, now under review by the Government. Harry Lister, group managing director, paid tribute to the support received from both the Welsh Office and the Welsh Development Agency. He said: \\u2018It has been the critical factor in deciding to make our investment here in Wrexham rather than elsewhere.\\u2019 Swraj Paul, Caparo Group chairman, said: \\u2018I have great faith in British manufacturing capability. The group is keen to expand its manufacturing base in the UK with a view to exporting products to Europe and the rest of the world.\\u2019 Foster son tells court of \\u2018whippings ordeal\\u2019 at home Norman and Evelyn Roberts all charges denied Paul Llewelyn Jones \\u2018forced to eat left-overs\\u2019 By Daily Post Correspondent A TEENAGER yesterday claimed he was beaten with a horsewhip sometimes while dangling upside down from a rope by his foster father. Paul Llewelyn Jones told a jury at Mold Crown Court he was beaten with a cane or a whip three or four times a week and was forced to scour bins for food. When he was hungry, he went to eat the left-overs thrown to the dogs outside the Anglesey farmhouse where he was staying with foster parents. And when he was caught he was given a bowl of Winalot dog food, he alleged. \\u2018I ate it. I had no choice because I was starving. I felt sick after that. \\u2018They used to make me look a fool and leave a bowl outside for me.\\u2019 Mistreatment Norman Roberts, 59, of Ysgubor Escob at Gwalchmai, Anglesey, denies cruelty by wilful ill treatment and assault. His wife, Evelyn, 59, of the same address, denies wilful neglect and their son, Ian Roberts, 34, denies common assault. All the alleged incidents are said to have taken place between 1980 when he was fostered at the age of six by the family and 1985. The court was also told that Gwynedd Social Services department left the boy with the family, despite his allegations of mistreatment. David Hale, prosecuting, said photographs of the boy's injuries were taken by a doctor in Ysbyty Gwynedd in 1985 and he was placed on an at risk register. But social services decided they did not have sufficient information to justify removing him from the Roberts' care. The matter only came to light when police, conducting an inquiry into the running of children's homes in North Continued on Page 5 Continued from Page 1 Wales, interviewed the boy last year. He made no allegations concerning his time in homes at the age of four, but complained about his time at the smallholding in Anglesey. Jones, now 19, and living in Holyhead, also told the court he ate apple cores from the toilet in school, and took cake and other items from a bucket outside the school canteen. He spoke to a cook and used to be given second helpings. Jones said Roberts and son Ian would hold him upside down, tie his feet with rope or string, and tie it to an overhead pole. It was then he was whipped, he said, which happened three or four times. Mr Roberts would whip him, and his son would watch. But he alleged Ian hit him once or twice. But there were other times that he was whipped while standing up. He would be told to take down his trousers and underpants and would be whipped by his foster father, he alleged. \\u2018I used to be in agony all the time,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I have still got pains in my back now, and my legs and hands.\\u2019 He said he was scared of showing the marks to anyone, in case he got another good hiding. But a boy at Bodedern Secondary School had seen them and told a teacher, and Paul Jones said he showed the marks to three teachers at Gwalchmai school in 1985 and they telephoned the social services. Defending barrister Mr Thomas Teague accused Paul Jones of making up \\u2018wicked inventions.\\u2019 Mr Teague said that at no time was Paul Jones ever hit with a cane or whip, at no time was he tied upside down and hit, he was never forced to get up early to feed the animals, or ill-treated in any way whatsoever. He would sometimes be slapped with a hand on the bottom, and very occasionally would be given a clip around the ear by Mr Roberts. The case continues. Ian Roberts NAIL BOMB TRAGEDY BAe worker hurt in tour blast terror A NORTH Wales man was recovering last night after being pierced in the chest by a nail in a bomb blast which killed an Egyptian car driver. His wife also received medical attention after the nail bomb was dropped from a bridge on to their tour bus and other nearby vehicles in Cairo. British Aerospace worker Leonard Phillips, 61, had an operation to remove a nail embedded in his chest. His wife, Agnes, was last night at his bedside as four other slightly-injured Britons were flying to Cyprus. The couple, from Penyffordd, near Mostyn, were on a sightseeing tour to the Pyramids at Giza. It was the latest in a spate of attacks by Muslim extremists and blew out windows on the bus, packed with 49 British holidaymakers, and gutted a Mercedes. Father-of-two Mr Phillips is a quality manager at BAe's Broughton plant in Clwyd, and often travelled abroad as part of his work. Full story Page 22 Chaos in a crowded Cairo street after yesterday's nail bomb blast tragedy Picture: NORBERT SCHILLER Toft race with Park in a spin Cricket round-up ANOTHER excellent performance saw Toft progress to the fourth round of the Cheshire Cup with an emphatic win over Liverpool Competition side Birkenhead Park. Opener Chris Sheldon (48) dropped anchor and allowed the middle and later order batsmen to attack the bowling, Toft reaching 181 for seven in their 40 overs. Birkenhead Park were in trouble from the start against the spinners Paul Burtonshaw and Ronnie Locke. Their line and length was immaculate and after 16 overs Park were still in first gear on 28 for one. Forced into a run chase, Park lost wickets quickly, Brian Coutts finishing them off in the 39th over with three for 19. Bredbury took 12 points from the drawn game to take the lead at the top to 29 points. Beating Ashley in a low scoring game at home gave second-placed Mobberley 16 valuable points.

Hale Barns were bowled at home for 111 by Knutsford, Willie Hannan doing the damage with five for 37 but Knutsford's reply was shattered by aggressive fast bowling from Dave Molloy, seven for 47. Only Craig Stubbs with 33 not out looked comfortable as Hale Barns bowled Knutsford out for 101. Putting on the pounds HOSPITAL staff in Chester have raised almost \\u00a35,000 towards new equipment. In the last six months, \\u00a34,662 was raised through a lottery at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The Priority Care Unit benefitted to the tune of \\u00a32,300 with the purchase of outward bound equipment for the young people's unit, mirrors for the occupational therapy unit at Ellesmere Port and equipment for the physiotherapy gym, plus televisions, videos and pictures for wards. The accident and emergency department received \\u00a32,157 and other money has been given to the ambulance service. John Ross, chairman of Chester Health Authority, said: \\u2018I'm always amazed at the generosity of the staff on this site.\\u2019 John Ross: Amazed Sneak thief stole bag from toilet A SNEAK thief snatched a handbag while the owner was in a public toilet cubicle, magistrates were told at Warrington yesterday. On another occasion Pauline Jordan cashed a Giro cheque for \\u00a3330 after stealing it from her mother's house, the court heard. Jordan, 24, of Heather Close, Birchwood, Warrington, pleaded guilty to stealing a Giro cheque belonging to Brian Bennett, attempting to obtain \\u00a3330 by deception and stealing a handbag and contents belonging to Jean Baker. Jordan also asked for two offences of attempting to obtain money by deception to be taken into consideration. Mr Dennis Tighe, prosecuting, said Jordan acted as a \\u2018sneak thief\\u2019 when she stole the bag after reaching under a partition separating two cubicles in a public toilet. Jordan was remanded on bail until July 6 for presentence reports. Women's minister hits at \\u2018bigotry\\u2019 By Amanda Williamson Daily Post Staff MINISTER for Women's Affairs, David Hunt, claims he is a victim of prejudice. He defended his role on his visit to Merseyside yesterday. Responding to criticism that the job should automatically be given to a woman, Mr Hunt said: \\u2018I think that's an appalling statement. \\u2018It reflects the very bigotry which women have had to fight against. Nobody would dream of suggesting that only a man can understand male issues.\\u2019 The announcement that Mr Hunt, as current Employment Secretary, would take over responsibility for women's affairs was made at last week's Tory Women's Conference and sparked outrage from Labour MPs and women's lobby groups. Mayor who can stand the heat MAYOR Brian Lloyd aims to put some fire into his new job and yesterday joined Frodsham firefighters to show he means business. The town's new Mayor, only the second since it gained the town title, spent the day at the fire station to learn about their work. He said: \\u2018I feel that when you live in a town, you take the services for granted. \\u2018If you just ring them up you cannot understand the problems they face so I thought this would be a good way that I could use myself as a focus on their work.\\u2019 Before yesterday's behind-the-scenes look, Coun Lloyd experienced another, less glamorous, side of the fireman's work. For the past week the Mayor has suffered with the men as they respond to early morning calls. He had a bleeper in his house which wakes him up for every call though for insurance reasons he cannot join the men. Yesterday, Coun Lloyd, who retired from ICI last August, took part in a training operation with special cutting equipment. He also joined the men in a gym session and with a physiotherapist. He now plans a series of other hands-on visits including a day with the town's police officers and bin men. Mayor Brian Lloyd prepares to spend a day with Frodsham's firefighters NAIL BOMB TRAGEDY BAe worker hurt in tour blast terror A BROUGHTON British Aerospace executive was recovering last night after being pierced in the chest by a nail in a bomb blast which killed an Egyptian car driver. His wife also received medical attention after the nail bomb was dropped from a bridge on to their tour bus and other nearby vehicles in Cairo. BAe worker Leonard Phillips, 61, had an operation to remove a nail embedded in his chest. His wife, Agnes, was last night at his bedside as four other slightly-injured Britons were flying to Cyprus. The couple, from Penyffordd, near Mostyn, were on a sightseeing tour to the Pyramids at Giza. It was the latest in a spate of attacks by Muslim extremists and blew out windows on the bus, packed with 49 British holidaymakers, and gutted a Mercedes. Father-of-two Mr Phillips is a quality manager at BAe's Broughton plant, near Chester, and often travelled abroad as part of his work.

The sentence came under immediate attack, with the girl's mother saying she wanted the case reviewed, and child care experts saying the judge's remarks were \\u2018totally unacceptable.\\u2019 The judge told Gambrill he would have faced a prison sentence, but for mitigating circumstances. Information \\u2018The law in this country protects little girls because they do not know what is right and what is wrong. \\u2018They would take part in sexual activities because they would think that was right. \\u2018However, I have been provided with information which leads me to think she was not entirely an angel herself, which is no excuse for you. \\u2018And you were only 18 at the time as opposed to being a grown man.\\u2019 Gambrill, now 21, of Southampton, Hants, pleaded guilty. He was ordered to attend a programme of treatment for his sexual problems and pay \\u00a3100 costs. The court was told that Gambrill had climbed into the girl's bunk bed while babysitting and tried to have sex with her. The girl was said to have already \\u2018fallen prey\\u2019 to a sex gang, while Gambrill was sexually inexperienced. But the girl's parents, and police officers, said after the case that the so-called \\u2018sex gang\\u2019 was no more than Continued on Page 2 Continued from Page 1 playing doctors and nurses with other children in a garden shed. Valerie Howarth, executive director of ChildLine, said: \\u2018It is totally unacceptable that a judge should suggest that a child is responsible for sexual abuse perpetrated upon her.\\u2019 The girl's mother said she wanted the case to be brought back before court, as she said that motoring offenders were given sterner sentences than people who abused children. In 1976, as a county court judge, Judge Hill refused to give a wife suing for divorce a court order that her husband's mistress should be evicted from the marital home. His refusal on condition that the husband and mistress put themselves in sexual \\u2018quarantine\\u2019 was overturned in the Appeal Court, where one judge described the decision as \\u2018indefensible.\\u2019 In 1978, he told five youths who tied up a 14-year-old boy as a target for their catapults: \\u2018What is the best sentence for you really would be to have you tied to a tree and everybody throw stones at you. \\u2018But unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately I ought to say because the Press is here, that sort of sentence is not open to me.\\u2019 In 1988, he told an Iranian living on social security, found guilty of using a forged rent book and inflicting grievous bodily harm, that in his own country he would have had an arm chopped off \\u2018or something similarly spectacular.\\u2019 Unigate celebrates double profits SHAKE-UP SUCCESS A PROGRAMME of sell-offs and acquisitions enabled food and distribution group Unigate to boost profits by more than 50%. The group, known for the St Ivel brand, spent \\u00a3152m in the 18 months to May and raised \\u00a373m from disposals, figures show today. That enabled it to boost pre-tax profits to March 31 to \\u00a3101.4m from \\u00a365.7m in the previous 12 months. The sell-offs had a dramatic effect because some of the businesses were loss-makers which dragged down profits last time. Excluding the losses and other one-off charges, profits rose to \\u00a397.9m from \\u00a392m. The latest result was boosted by a \\u00a34m pension fund surplus. Businesses sold included US Cheese and Giltspur International. Unigate's car hire business is also being run down. On the group's shopping list was Sussex Dairies, bought from the Co-op, Clifford Foods and Glass Glover. The final dividend is raised to 10.4p from 9.6p, taking the total to 16.1p from 15.3p. Earnings per share rose to 31.3p from 23.4p. Tebbit warns of \\u2018tears\\u2019 on EC treaty THE Maastricht Treaty will end in tears, Lord Tebbit warned early today towards the end of a marathon two day Lords debate on the ratification Bill. The Tory former Cabinet minister, summing up the case of those opposed to European union, demanded a referendum. Shortly before the European Communities (Amendment) Bill was due to gain its second reading, he told the House that the referendum question could be perfectly simple unless the job of formulating it was given to the Department of Education officials who framed the current controversial tests for 14-year-olds. It should state: \\u2018Do you want this treaty to be brought into effect or not?\\u2019 Lord Tebbit claimed that if Britain said \\u2018no\\u2019, the Community would go on just the same as it did yesterday. He asked why it was said that if Denmark and Britain rejected the treaty they would have to leave the EC, when this had not been said of France or Germany. He forecast: \\u2018This Treaty will end in tears it is better that it ends in tears now than it ends in very bitter tears in five, ten or 15 years.\\u2019 Earlier in the day's debate, Viscount Whitelaw, former Tory Deputy Prime Minister under Margaret Thatcher, accused treaty opponents of \\u2018taking a narrow-minded view.\\u2019 Labour ex-Prime Minister Lord Callaghan said: \\u2018The imperative that impels this treaty is the overriding necessity of preserving the peace and security of the European mainland and hence the British Isles themselves.\\u2019 Thieving trio use baby decoy to con woman, 89 By Richard Elias Daily Post Staff A WOMAN clutching a baby stole an elderly lady's purse after conning her way into the pensioner's home. The thief called at the house on east Merseyside with another woman and a man, and asked if she could use the toilet. But minutes later, when the trio had left, the 89 year old lady discovered that her purse had been taken from a bedroom of her terraced home in Albany Road, Prescot. Last night a detective investigating the theft said that, although this type of crime was becoming increasingly prevalent, it was the first time he had heard of a baby being used as a decoy. Det Con Steve Roberts added: \\u2018It is unusual to say the least, the fact that one of these women was holding a baby at the time.\\u2019 The three called on the victim who lives alone shortly before 9pm on Monday night. They claimed their car, which they parked outside the house, had broken down. Whilst the man and one of the women stayed talking to the householder, the other woman, holding the child, was directed to the toilet. Added Det Con Roberts: \\u2018It was only later that the lady realised that her purse, containing around \\u00a3220 in cash, had been taken.\\u2019 The woman who was holding the baby is white, in her 30s, with brown, tidy collar length hair. Her female accomplice was younger, possibly in her 20s, with long, very fair hair. The man was around 5ft 4ins tall and had fair coloured hair. The gang told the woman they were heading towards Widnes, and they then set off in a blue car. Anyone who has any information about the incident is asked to contact Prescot CID on , ex 4285. Union official is jailed for theft of welfare cash By Lynda Roughley Daily Post Correspondent FORMER Liverpool City Council trade unionist Tony Gavin, who stole welfare funds, has been jailed for three months. Gavin, 35, who was a full-time Nalgo official, admitted stealing money belonging to the City Council Life Insurance Welfare Scheme. Jailing Gavin yesterday, Liverpool Crown Court judge David Lynch said he had used the fund's bank account as his own and had stolen between \\u00a33,500 and \\u00a34,200. He had taken the money to pay off debts and had continued to do so even when bereaved relatives were desperate for cash to pay undertakers' bills. \\u2018That is unforgivable,\\u2019 said the judge. Gavin, of Briar Drive, Huyton, admitted eight thefts between January 1990 and October 1991. He denied a further 10 theft and deception offences and not guilty verdicts were recorded. Prosecuting counsel Antonis Georges said Gavin had been treasurer of the Welfare Scheme since 1985. Each week 800 council employees voluntarily contributed 50p from their wages of which 31p was paid to an insurance company which paid out \\u00a32,750 upon death. The balance of the contribution was paid into the welfare fund, which was used to provide interest free hardship loans. As well as writing cheques from the account to pay his credit card debts and rent arrears, he also paid phone bills and part of \\u00a3500 taxi bill. Matters came to light after relatives of the deceased employees did not receive the expected death benefits even though the insurance company had paid out the cheques to the fund. Gavin repeatedly tried to fob them off and one family has still not been paid. Defence counsel Roderick Carus, QC, said proper records had never been kept by the Welfare Scheme. During the 1991 bin men's strike, the situation became chaotic as Gavin was hounded for hardship payments. The fund's other trustees had left and he was under an intolerable strain, working more than 12 hours a day. He received no pay for being the treasurer and his own debt continued to escalate, so he used the fund account to ease his financial situation. He has since been sacked by Nalgo and has debts of \\u00a310,000. Mr Carus said father-of-three Gavin had housebound parents. His wife was in poor health and would suffer if he was jailed. Alton's acceptance of party's abortion stance welcomed by Ashdown By David Rose Daily Post Political Editor LIBERAL Democrat leaders have healed a party rift which threatened the desertion of hundreds of rank-and-file members, and the walk-out of one MP. To the relief of Paddy Ashdown, Liverpool Mossley Hill MP David Alton said yesterday there was now no obstacle to his standing again at the next general election. Last autumn Mr Alton threatened to stand down after the party's Harrogate conference endorsed a strong pro-abortion line. But two weeks ago the Liberal Democrats quietly reversed their policy at their Spring conference in Nottingham, making clear that abortion was a matter for the conscience of individuals. Hundreds of rank-and-file members in the 100,000 strong Liberal Democrats backed Mr Alton in protesting over the Harrogate decision, and threatened to sever their links with the party. Mr Alton, a Catholic and a leading campaigner for reforming the abortion law, told the Daily Post: \\u2018The way is open for me to stand. My constituency association supported me 100 per cent.\\u2019 Mr Ashdown welcomed the decision by Mr Alton, an MP since winning a by-election in 1979. The Liberal Democrat leader told the Daily Post: \\u2018I am delighted with the sensible decision taken by our Spring conference, and David's statement. \\u2018David is a valued MP, a superb campaigner for Liberal Democracy, and will always be a welcome member of our team at Westminster.\\u2019 David Alton Paddy Ashdown Masseuse murder riddle detectives chase new leads By Cath Steward Daily Post Staff DETECTIVES were last night following up two new leads in their hunt for the killer of masseuse Lynne Trenholme. They say it is too soon to say if either will produce any results, but Chief Inspector Steve Cross of Cheshire's Serious Crime Squad confirmed: \\u2018We have been given some new names which we are following up at the moment. \\u2018We are still investigating them at present and have not ruled them out.\\u2019 Today marks the second anniversary of Miss Trenholme's death. Her bloodstained body was found at Pinky's massage parlour, Boughton, where she worked. Miss Trenholme, 29, and originally from Failsworth, Manchester, had been working at Pinky's unbeknown to her family, who thought she was employed as a secretary. She used the name Blondie to hide her identity. It is believed the motive for the killing was robbery as the \\u00a3170 that Miss Trenholme earned that day has never been traced. Police believe the man responsible for the murder is a client known only as John who signed his name in the book at the massage parlour on the day Miss Trenholme was murdered. They believe he may be the same man who made a number of violent attacks on prostitutes in Warrington and Crewe. They are still trying to trace the owner of a metallic blue Vauxhall Carlton which was parked near Pinky's on the day of Lynne's death. The driver is described as in his early 40s, 5ft 10ins to 6ft tall. Police are expecting to pick up more new leads later this year as forces throughout the country join a national fingerprint computer system, which will enable them to check unidentified prints from Pinky's. \\u2018We are also in contact with other forces every time a prostitute-related offence comes up,\\u2019 said Chief Insp Cross. \\u2018This case has certainly not been forgotten and we still want to hear from anyone with information. \\u2018We still believe that there is someone who knows who this man is.\\u2019 Lynne Trenholme Short, sharp shock for raiders at cricket club By Geoff Barnes Daily Post Staff A CRICKET club is biting back at persistent raiders and vandals by covering the roof of its pavilion with razor-sharp security wire. Norman Costain, secretary of Parkfield Cricket Club in Wallasey Central Park, said: \\u2018We were under siege. \\u2018But since we installed the razor wire we have had no problems.\\u2019 The action, however, has met with the disapproval of Wirral planning authority, which views the wire as visually intrusive in the park environment. The clubhouse is prominently placed close to the park boundary and nearby homes. Planners have condemned the wire as \\u2018unsympathetic and alien\\u2019 to the design of the building. Mr Costain explained: \\u2018We have told the council this is only a temporary measure until we get an extension built at the club and strengthen the roofing. \\u2018We are asking for a temporary reprieve.\\u2019 The club's original wooden pavilion was burned down in 1977. Said Mr Costain: \\u2018We would have liked to build a replacement with a wooden verandah and steps, but it can't be done in this day and age, so we had to build a concrete one like Fort Knox.\\u2019 Three break-ins in five months forced club officials to adopt the razor-wire option to deter raiders. Club members gave up their sleep to spend the night guarding the pavilion. The club's application to retain the wire will be considered tomorrow night. Planners have recommended enforcement action compelling the club to remove the wire with 12 months lee-way. Police cash crisis over bombs probe is \\u2018solved\\u2019 By Cath Steward Daily Post Staff A POLICE cash crisis caused by the \\u00a3650,000 cost of investigating the Warrington bombings seems to have been resolved. Cheshire's Chief Constable, David Graham, had warned that manpower would be reduced and cuts made in police station opening hours if the money was not found. The results could have been disastrous for the force which has already had to freeze recruitment of officers during 1993 to keep within a tight budget. But at a meeting of Cheshire's Police Committee yesterday, councillors made a unanimous decision to find half of the money out of the county council's reserves. The decision still has to be ratified by the Finance and Management Services Committee. It is expected that the Home Office will come up with the rest of the money. The investigations into the two IRA attacks on February 26 and March 20 involved the setting up of two major incident rooms within Warrington Police Station as well as the setting up of a special HQ for CID costing \\u00a335,000. Councillors may visit the Home Secretary later in the year to ask him to consider funding a greater proportion of the cost of the investigations, but chairman of the Police Committee, John Collins, warned they were unlikely to receive more than half of the sum. \\u2018The \\u00a3665,000 is not a sum that I believe would gain a positive response from the Government in respect of national assistance. But we would not want to miss an opportunity or to court a refusal,\\u2019 he said. The decision whether to ask for more money from the Home Office will be made by a special panel who meet on June 25 to discuss the issue, as well as deciding how to fund new security cameras for Warrington and police pay rises. David Graham: Warning Ambitious barrage plans \\u2018suspended but not dead\\u2019 By Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs Correspondent PLANS for one of the most ambitious civil engineering projects envisaged for the North West are to be left gathering dust. Studies for the \\u00a31bn Mersey Barrage scheme have Ironically, the project has reached the end of the road as its counterpart in Cardiff Bay begins its final stages through the House of Commons. When first launched, the Mersey Barrage scheme was projected to create 5,000 construction jobs and numerous leisure spin-offs. Mersey Barrage Company bosses say the scheme has proved too bold for the funding it needed. General Manager James McCormack said: \\u2018Rather than plough on regardless, we have decided to suspend the project.\\u2019 Mr McCormack said this did not mean the barrage project was dead and buried. He added: \\u2018I am still absolutely convinced the barrage will be built. \\u2018We are convinced by the former Chancellor's Autumn Statement proposing support for joint ventures between public and private cash. This would be an excellent opportunity to prove such plans could work.\\u2019 John Major's government has refused to provide cash for phase four of the project, despite being told it would now cost substantially less than first thought. Mossley Hill MP David Alton, who chairs the all-party Mersey Barrage Group, said: \\u2018Things are unlikely to happen until there is a political will and a more interventionist approach.\\u2019 The scheme, with its first three survey phases now complete, has cost \\u00a36.3m over the past six years. MBC shareholders include Barclays Bank and Littlewoods. An artist's impression of the proposed Mersey Barrage, which has been shelved Major raps Mates over gift to Nadir By David Rose Political Editor NORTHERN Ireland Minister Michael Mates was placed on probation last night after John Major publicly slapped him down in front of MPs. The Prime Minister said Mr Mates had been \\u2018unwise\\u2019 to present runaway tycoon Asil Nadir, under investigation by the Serious Fraud Squad, with a watch inscribed \\u2018Don't let the buggers get you down.\\u2019 But he made clear it was not a sacking offence and he regarded the matter as closed. \\u2018It was a misjudgment, but it is not a hanging offence,\\u2019 Mr Major said. Before signalling that he could keep his job, Mr Mates, however, was quizzed by Downing Street about any links he had with Mr Nadir. Mr Major instructed his Principal Private Secretary, Alex Allen, to demand answers from the minister before facing MPs in the Commons. \\u2018I am assured by Mr Mates that he has had no financial involvement with Mr Nadir, nor with any of his companies or with his advisers, either before he became a minister or since,\\u2019 said Mr Major. Mr Mates had approached the Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, over the handling of the case by the Serious Fraud Squad at the request of one of Mr Nadir's advisers, who was a constituent of his. Comment Page 18 PM Unity plea to party rebels Embattled Major acts to head off Tory mutiny By David Hope Political Editor JOHN Major will move today to head off a threatened mutiny by the Tory Right to sink his premiership. He will use the platform provided by the Tory Women's Conference to try to reassure the Tory Right that the Left has not taken over the Government. And other Cabinet ministers are lined up to pledge their full loyalty to Mr Major, and plead with the Tories to pull together. Top Tories will act to counter the threat of guerrilla warfare from the Tory Right, issued yesterday by Edward Leigh, sacked as junior Industry Minister in last week's reshuffle. He voiced the fear of other Right-wingers that the sacking of Norman Lamont had left Left-wingers in key jobs. And he added to the problems confronting new Welsh Secretary John Redwood by referring to Wales as one of the \\u2018isolated fortresses\\u2019 held by the Tory Right in the Government. Since taking over from Left-winger David Hunt, former Thatcherite Mr Redwood has been trying to reassure the Welsh that there will be no dramatic change in Welsh Office policy. Mr Leigh said: \\u2018The Left of the Tory party has now achieved its ambition to control economic, foreign and industrial policy. \\u2018The Right sits beleaguered in isolated fortresses in the Home Office, Social Security and Wales. \\u2018But we on the Right must fight back.\\u2019 Mr Leigh also highlighted the tensions in Government by revealing that as a minister he had organised other meetings of junior ministers in opposition to the Maastricht Bill paving the way for closer European ties. After one meeting, attended by 14 ministers, he went to see Mr Major as their spokesman. \\u2018I was sacked for speaking my mind too loudly,\\u2019 he said. And he turned on Mr Major to accuse him of running \\u2018a regime unwilling to tolerate dissent and afraid of views different from its own\\u2019. He later said there was a need to build up an alternative force on the backbenches to put forward \\u2018tough, positive, coherent\\u2019 policies. More worrying for Mr Major, however, are growing signs that Mr Lamont is also planning his revenge. He has already allowed friends to put it around that he only stayed as Chancellor after Black Wednesday because Mr Major begged him to. Right-wing rumblings of rebellion over the reshuffle have raised the prospect of them mounting a challenger to Mr Major's leadership. Yesterday, one Right-winger who did well in the reshuffle, Home Secretary Michael Howard, followed Scottish Secretary Ian Lang in defending Mr Major. He said there would always be some voices of dissent. But the overwhelming majority of the party was fully prepared to give Mr Major full credit for winning the general election and driving the Maastricht Bill through \\u2018and back him 100 per cent\\u2019. Mr Major, meanwhile, cancelled a scheduled visit to Manchester to watch the Test match and worked on his speech instead. John Major John Redwood Five Britons injured as bomb wrecks Egypt bus By Shenai Raif and Roger Williams FIVE British tourists to Egypt, including one from Mold, were injured when a bomb was dropped from a bridge in Cairo as their tour bus headed out to see the pyramids at Giza. An Egyptian man in a car was killed and nine other people injured in the latest of a spate of attacks by Muslim militants. Forty-nine Britons on an excursion from Cyprus were on the bus going through an underpass when a man dropped a nail bomb from above. It blew out the windows of the bus, which crashed into the back of the Mercedes. At least four other cars and a motorcyle were caught in the mayhem. One of the injured Britons, Leonard Philips, from Mold, had to undergo an operation to remove a nail which embedded in his chest. The other four British tourists affected had only slight wounds and were on their way back to Cyprus tonight. Mr Philips remained in hospital near Cairo, and his wife Agnes stayed behind to comfort him. Hospital manager Ibrahim Fouad said his condition was very good. \\u2018Fortunately, the nail had only gone into his chest wall and did not enter his lungs, we shall keep him here for a day or two under observation.\\u2019 Cecil and Margaret Sharp, from Grampian, and John and Carol Cook, from Essex, rejoined the 43 other Britons from the coach on the Romantica cruise ship last night. The attack is being blamed on Muslim militants who have waged a campaign of violence for more than a year trying to undermine the country's lucrative tourist industry. Their aim is overthrow the government and turn Egypt into a purist Islamic state. The Foreign Office in London is considering a report from British Consul Anita Sheldon, who visited the scene and the injured. A spokesman said: \\u2018We are considering whether to change advice to Britons. It could take some time.\\u2019 Advice to visitors issued in March was to be vigilant at all times, avoid Dairut and Assiut where the most serious attacks have occurred unless carrying out essential business, and dress and behave discreetly. While the highest priority was given to protecting visitors, further incidents \\u2018must be expected\\u2019. Shattered the Cairo tour bus after the bomb attack Blue-print for streets of need Cheshire Show is hit by gas pipeline work By David Banks and David Lloyd A GAS pipeline which cuts across the Cheshire Show field has hindered preparations for the event. Organisers have been forced cut down on competitors and rent extra land after the British Gas pipeline interfered with their plans. The laying of the pipeline has meant some land at the showground in Tabley, near Knutsford, cannot be used this year. Seven acres of land has been rented to make up for the lost space. There will be no donkeys or coloured and part-bred Welsh ponies at this year's show, which takes place on June 22 and 23. \\u2018The pipeline running from Carrington to Audlem carved a swathe through the northern end of our showground,\\u2019 show vice-chairman Geoff Morris said. \\u2018It was re-seeded but the seed was drowned out last autumn and difficult weather conditions in the spring means that it has to remain fenced off and unusable for this year's show.\\u2019 Joint show secretary Margaret Hollinshead said work on the pipeline had forced them to drop two judging rings for the donkeys and ponies. British Gas would not comment on the matter yesterday. The cost of this year's show has been put at \\u00a3350,000, but admission prices have been kept at \\u00a36 for adults, \\u00a35 for senior citizens and \\u00a33 for children. Almost 60,000 people attended last year's event. Despite the cancellation of some of the sections the overall entry for light horses at this year's show is close to 3,000. The ever-popular shire horse entry has an increased turnout of 140, making the show the second most important shop window for the one-time farm workhorse. A prize of nearly \\u00a32,000 for top dairy cattle has encouraged a huge entry of 777 animals, bucking downward national trends. The showground will play host to more than 10,000 animals this year. Last year's show enjoyed perfect weather and organisers are hoping for a repeat to attract even bigger crowds. The shire horses, whose entry has increased to 140 this year Picture: STEPHEN SHAKESHAFT Margaret Hollinshead: British troops witness \\u2018cold-blooded\\u2019 massacre By Daily Post Correspondent BRITISH peacekeepers saw Muslim soldiers gun down Croat civilians yesterday, UN military sources said. \\u2018They saw people killed in cold blood,\\u2019 one said. \\u2018When they saw atrocities the British soldiers moved in to stop them.\\u2019 The sources said the incidents were in Croat villages seized by mainly Muslim Bosnian forces in an offensive near Travnik in central Bosnia. British troops managed to prevent about 30 Muslim fighters from gunning down some 170 civilians around Guca Gora, they said. \\u2018The British told the soldiers to lay down their arms and gathered the civilians into a church and contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to evacuate them,\\u2019 a source said. Elsewhere troops saw civilians shot as Muslim soldiers fought their way from house to house. At least five Croat villages had been \\u2018cleansed\\u2019 of Croats by the advancing Muslims. The fierce battle for Travnik was now over, the sources said. Fighting between the former allies yesterday sent more terrified Croat refugees fleeing from the city as desperate Croat defenders pounded positions occupied by Muslim troops. The battle for Travnik has turned into a rout for the Croats who at the start of the Bosnian war were allied with the Muslims against the Serbs. Now the allies are tearing at each other in a savage grab for territory. The Bosnian Serb news agency said the number of beaten Croat soldiers and civilians seeking shelter with the Serbs in the nearby Mount Vlasic area had doubled overnight to 8,000. A spokesman for the Croatian Defence Force, the HVO, admitted that around 1,000 of its soldiers had disobeyed orders and surrendered to nearby Serb forces on Monday. THE DEATH OF TWO NORTH WEST INSTITUTIONS HAS CAUSED SADNESS WITH A PIT SHUTTING AND A FAMOUS STORE'S TILLS RINGING FOR THE LAST TIME FOR about 70 years, the giant department store of Owen Owen was as well-known a part of the Liverpool scene as the Pier Head. But today it closes its doors for the last time. ANDREW FORGRAVE was there yesterday for some sad farewells City shoppers say farewell to an old friend AN ERA ends today when the shutters come down for the last time at the Owen Owen store in Liverpool. Shoppers throughout the North West will be left to mourn a once great department store which dominated Liverpool's city centre shopping for almost seven decades. Its only legacy will be the widespread attraction the store held for millions of day-trippers who based a visit to Liverpool around a trip to Owen Owen's. In the past few days shoppers have been paying one last visit to the store, many angered by a trend which has seen Liverpool stripped of many of its landmark shops. Alongside Owen Owen is a list which also includes such well-known names as Blacklers, Binns, Coopers and Woolworths. Inside the store in Clayton Square yesterday, bargain hunters picked over sale items while others wandered around saying silent farewells to an old friend. Shelves were bare, displays empty, areas sectioned off and cheap jewellery was 50pc sale price or less. Everywhere there was a deep sense of sadness. Margaret and Jack Carolan, from Huyton, had sneaked a camera inside and were snapping off shots as keepsakes. Mrs Carolan said: \\u2018It's very sad another chunk of the old Liverpool gone. Shopping will never be the same again.\\u2019 Nostalgia combined with a sense of loss prompted Patricia Gosling to visit the store yesterday. \\u2018I think it's such a shame. I have shopped here for as long as I can remember. They're taking the real feeling of Liverpool away,\\u2019 she said. For Margaret Williams, of Everton, Owen Owen was a family tradition: \\u2018I used to come here with my mum and now I bring my children.\\u2019 Catherine Kirkham, of Netherton, said it was the end of an era: \\u2018I can never remember Liverpool without Owen Owen. \\u2018What's going to happen now? Are they to close Liverpool altogether? I came here today to have a look but I didn't think it would affect me the way it has. It's all very sad.\\u2019 Joan Andrews, of Pensby, Wirral, added: \\u2018I don't go shopping in Liverpool all that often, but I do try and visit Owen Owen. It's a very sad day for the city.\\u2019 Three-quarters of the store's 164 staff, half of them full time, will lose their jobs. Many have gone already. The rest will be transferred to the Owen Owen group's other Liverpool store, Lewis's, where much of the Clayton Square activity will now be concentrated. Food chain Tescos is thought to be interested in taking over the imposing building. But, for now, shoppers will be left to reflect on a bygone era when the Owen Owen store was the heart of Liverpool retailing. Joan Andrews Catherine Kirkham Patricia Gosling Owen Owen's store today is its last day of business Aid delay to disabled in trouble WIRRAL social services, smarting from an Ombudsman's rap, claimed last night it had been the victim of its own generous policies. Ombudsman Pat Thomas investigated eight complaints in connection with the provision of equipment and adaptations to the homes of disabled people. Maladministration was proved in all but one of the cases. But a social services spokesman said last night: \\u2018The council is unhappy at the situation and feels it is being penalised because of its generous policies.\\u2019 He claimed that the delays were caused by the volume of demand and the shortage of staff and money. And he warned that any compensation paid to satisfy the Ombudman's requirements, would squeeze funds set aside to help people with disabilities. He said: \\u2018Wirral Council spent over \\u00a33m last year in assisting people with physical disability. \\u2018It has above national average figures for the employment of occupational therapists. \\u2018Each month approximately 300 new requests are made for an occupational therapist assessment and this level of demand far outstrips the borough's available resources.\\u2019 Tom Curran, deputy director of Wirral social services department, said: \\u2018If, in the first place, we had said to people they did not meet the criteria and did not put their names on the waiting list, we would be in less trouble.\\u2019 In future, he said, there would be strict adherence to criteria, which would mean less people going onto the waiting list. He added: \\u2018It seems a bit of a nonsense to struggle to provide a good service and then for compensation awarded by the Ombudsman to come out of the money provided for the work in the first place.\\u2019 By Geoff Barnes Daily Post Staff Such a relief! Windfall from landsale boosts schools budget By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff MAJOR school building work can go ahead this year thanks to a financial windfall from Clwyd's oil and gas finds. Services in Clwyd are reaping the benefits of the county council's sale of land at Point of Ayr to Hamilton Oil for its oil and gas terminal. Without it, the county education authority would only have had \\u00a3650,000 to spend on building work this year. Instead, the authority has an extra \\u00a32.78m taking its 1993\\u201394 total to \\u00a33.43m. If councillors approve the spending list at the meeting on Wednesday, a number of schools will benefit. Castell Alun High, at Hope, near Wrexham, will get \\u00a3500,000 to start on new buildings to replace portable classrooms, part of a \\u00a31.75m scheme. Wrexham Acton junior school is in line for \\u00a3600,000 to begin a \\u00a3900,000 improvement. Llay Junior gets \\u00a3500,000 to start its \\u00a3700,000 improvement, while Ruabon High will get \\u00a360,000 towards its \\u00a3700,000 scheme. Meanwhile, Hawarden High is getting \\u00a370,000 towards its \\u00a31.55m scheme and Flint Cornist primary also gets \\u00a370,000 towards a \\u00a31.17m scheme. Up to \\u00a31.3m is being allocated for minor work at Prestatyn, Ruthin Brynhyfryd and Saltney high schools and primaries at Cefn Mawr, Denbigh Twm or Nant, Denbigh Ysgol y Parc, Ewloe Green, Flint Cornist, Garth, Gwernaffield, Hawarden Penarlag, Johnstown Infants, Leeswood, Llansannan, Llantysilio, Old Colwyn T Gwynn Jones, Prestatyn Penmorfa, Rhyl Brynhedydd, Rhyl Emmanuel, Rhyl Dewi Sant, Shotton Edward Morgan, Trelawnyd, Llangernyw, Wrexham Wats Dyke. Children face tests in TB alert By Cath Steward Daily Post Staff PARENTS are facing an agonizing six-week wait after it was revealed that a hospital paediatrician is suffering from tuberculosis. Tests will be carried out on up to 500 children across the North West who have been treated by the doctor. Health officials at the Countess of Chester Hospital, where the man works, have set up an emergency clinic to carry out skin tests on the youngsters and 500 staff who are known to have come into contact with the man. Counsellors have also been drafted in to provide reassurance and advice for the hundreds of worried parents who are expected to contact the hospital. Sixty per cent of the children come from Chester and Ellesmere Port with the others coming from Clwyd or Wirral. The tests are due to be carried out over the next fortnight but parents will face a six-week wait for the results. Doctors were first alerted on May 21, when the man, a junior paediatrician, began to cough up blood. Dr Ian Keeping, who diagnosed TB and has since been treating the doctor, said: \\u2018The man stopped work immediately and we set about investigations to establish a diagnosis. \\u2018This was finalised on May 27. We don't believe he was infectious before May 21 and we expect him to make a complete recovery. \\u2018We don't know where he contracted the disease but the likelihood is it was from a patient.\\u2019 Personal details about the doctor are not Continued on Page 2 Continued from Page 1 being released but he is undergoing treatment and is expected to be back at work soon. Paul Barrow, chief executive of the hospital trust said the chances of someone catching the disease from him were \\u2018a million to one.\\u2019 \\u2018The chance of any child having been infected is extremely remote,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Tuberculosis is contracted through prolonged contact with someone with symptoms of the disease. \\u2018In this case the doctor stopped work immediately he displayed any symptoms and has remained off work.\\u2019 Even if someone does catch the disease, experts say it is extremely treatable and nearly all patients make a full recovery. \\u2018These days TB is easily cured by antibiotics. Patients cease to be infectious within two weeks of starting treatment,\\u2019 said Dr Philip Mannion from the Public Health Laboratory Service. All the children called in have been treated by the man in the past two months. A small number of children who attended community clinics held by the man will also be seen. The symptoms of TB are a persistent cough, a feeling of general ill-health, listlessness and weight loss. A helpline has been set up for anxious parents. The telephone numbers are  and . Angry bikers left stranded at pier By Andrew Forgrave Daily Post Staff BIKERS, who had travelled from all over the world for the Isle of Man TT motorcycle races, were left stranded at Liverpool's Pier Head yesterday. Hundreds of motorcycle racing enthusiasts remained stuck on the mainland after the Lady of Man ferry was damaged in a crash at Douglas Harbour. And many of them were angered at what they said was a lack of information from the ferry company on replacement sailings. Ted Pratt, 48, from Boston, and Wolfgang Heinrich, from Berlin, were among those who complained of long delays and lack of information. But TT race organisers are confident the world's most famous motorbike event will get under way on schedule despite transport hitches. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, which owns the ferry, said the vessel struck a quayside just above the waterline, crushing the hull inwards, in the accident on Wednesday. No-one was hurt and engineers immediately set to work making temporary repairs to the hull. The boat is expected to be operational by this afternoon. A BAe 146 plane was chartered by the company to fly 80 motorcycle enthusiasts from Speke Airport. But that too ran into difficulties when thick fog on the runway at Ronaldsway Airport, Douglas, delayed the flight for more than an hour. Last night 400 bikers were drifting away from Pier Head to other ports after being told extra boats would be chartered from alternative ports today. Steam Packet managers have organised relief sailings from Stranraer, Gourock, and Heysham. A spokesman said: \\u2018The company wishes to thank all those affected by the delays for their tolerance in these trying circumstances.\\u2019 TT race organisers said the ferry crash was only a minor setback because the first race does not start until tomorrow afternoon. Most competitors had already arrived. Isle of Man TT motorcycle race fans stranded at Pier Head, Liverpool, yesterday Parents to face ballot re-run on opting out A SECOND ballot on the future of one of Merseyside's largest Catholic schools is to be held, following an invalid vote by parents. Parents of pupils at St Mary's College, Wallasey, voted to reject proposals to opt out of local authority control by 552 to 211. But the vote has been declared invalid because fewer than half the parents took part in the ballot. Another ballot will now be held to determine whether the 1,000-pupil comprehensive will obtain grant-maintained status or stay within Wirral local authority. A spokesman for Wirral's education department said: \\u2018We are pleased that so many parents voted against opting out, but regret that the ballot has to be re-run. \\u2018St Mary's is a good school providing quality education. We want to see our partnership continue.\\u2019 Only 48pc of the ballot papers sent out were returned to the Electoral Reform Society and, despite a 72pc vote against independence, the law requires at least half of all parents to take part before the result can stand. Had forty more parents voted, the vote would have been valid. The second ballot will take place over the next fortnight, and the result will stand no matter how many parents vote. Calday Grange Grammar School also faced a second ballot over opting out after it applied for grant-maintained status last year. There were just two more votes for opting out than against, and Education Secretary John Patten decided the vote was unsafe because of\\u2018errors in the distribution of ballot papers.\\u2019 The only Wirral opt-out votes preceding St Mary's College have been at grammar schools. Calday Grange School voted to leave local authority control in June last year, and Wirral School for Boys went along the same path one week later. In both cases, opting out was perceived as a means of ensuring the survival of grammar school status. By Chris Parker Daily Post Staff Man kills girlfriend then shoots himself Jilted boyfriend in avenging bloodbath By Daily Post Correspondent JILTED boyfriend Alan Graham killed his lover with a sawn-off shotgun yesterday before turning the weapon on himself. Graham, 29, went to confront 19-year-old Samantha Gibson after she walked out on him. He took his gun and marched to the house of his best friend, Phil Lowe, where Miss Gibson was staying, and demanded to see her. Then he forced his way inside and confronted her as Mr Lowe's grandfather George Norris, 73, tried to halt the violence, telling the gunman: \\u2018Don't shoot the girl.\\u2019 But he shot Mr Morris in the leg in front of his five-year-old granddaughter, Amy, then bundled Amy and Mr Lowe's wife Jeanette, 26, into a bedroom. As the wounded grandfather pleaded with him to leave Miss Gibson alone, Graham shot her in the chest at point blank range, killing her instantly. He then walked into a bedroom and shot himself in the chest. Graham and Miss Gibson had been living at his house on the Riddings Estate in Scunthorpe but split up after a row on Monday night. After the shootings in Somerby Road, just 200 yards from Graham's home, neighbours rushed into the house to find Mr Norris lying in agony on the landing. Pamela Meikle, 50, said: \\u2018I heard a loud bang and then some more. Then all hell broke loose. Phil came running in to the street saying: \\u2018He shot my granddad\\u2019. \\u2018I ran into Phil's house and saw the granddad lying on the floor with a hole in his leg. There was blood everywhere and he was screaming for help. \\u2018Right behind him, about two foot away, was Samantha. She was lying on her back with blood on her chest. \\u2018I knew Alan was in the house somewhere but I didn't know where. I opened the bedroom door and there he was lying on the floor dead. The gun was lying next to him.\\u2019 Mrs Meikle said just two days ago Graham had been seen in a local pub. She said: \\u2018He was telling everyone that if his girlfriend ever left him he would kill her. Nobody took him seriously.\\u2019 Mrs Meikle's daughter, Jane Waudby, 29, who also lives next door, put towels on Mr Norris's leg to try to stop the blood. She said: \\u2018It was carnage.\\u2019 Mr Norris was taken to Scunthorpe General Hospital but later transferred to Hull Royal Infirmary where he underwent surgery on his right thigh. He is in a stable condition. Lifetime of service earns head reward A LIFETIME'S work for the Urdd brought a North Wales head teacher the most prestigious \\u2018thankyou\\u2019 the Urdd can give. The John and Ceridwen Hughes Uwchaled award is given annually to individuals in recognition of outstanding service through the Welsh language, to young people over the age of 11 outside formal education. The winner, Llew Williams, of Llangernyw, retires from his post as head of Ysgol Bod Alaw, Colwyn Bay, in September. His record for the Urdd and the community generally spans four decades, from being the secretary of Llangwm Aelwyd, where he grew up, to founding and leading two senior branches at Capel Garmon and Bro Cernyw. He is still the leader of the latter, but with three assistants, now after 18 years. He was the warden of the village's education centre for nine years, has served as a member of the Urdd Council and was the movement's vice-president for three years. Bro Cernyw Aelwyd has over the years won in almost all sections of the Urdd's activities, from Eisteddfod competitions to darts, pool, five-a-side football and twice runners up in the national quiz competition. Llew Williams\\u2026four decades of Urdd devotion TURNING THE KNIFE BA yesterday revealed it is one of the financial institutions backing former British Aerospace executive Richard Hooke in his bid for BAe's Corporate Jet business. There was another piece of good news yesterday with the announcement that BAe plans to take on apprentices again. The Corporate Jet business is being sold to American conglomerate Raytheon for \\u00a3250m. But Mr Hooke says until the deal is closed he will continue to try to put his bid before BAe's board. Unity Trust, the trades union and co-operative financial institution, has discussed with Mr Hooke the possibility of an employee stake in the new company through an employee share ownership plan. Gordon Beesley, managing director, said: \\u2018The initiative has our support. The impact on jobs of a sale to a foreign bidder would be highly unfavourable. \\u2018We believe the buy-out team should be allowed to formulate proposals which would keep the control of this company in the UK.\\u2019 It is understood Mr Hooke has major institutions to act as equity and debt providers. BAe has argued Raytheon was the better deal for employees and shareholders. Mr Beesley said: \\u2018We shall be asking the Government to ensure that BAe supplies the necessary information to the buy-out team to enable a formal offer to be made.\\u2019 Amid all the gloom of redundancies and take-over deals, BAe has announced it wants to recruit apprentices at its Broughton factory for the first time in three years. The company is looking to hire between 20\\u201330 to work on Airbus wing production. George Marshall, head of human resources, said: \\u2018In spite of our current employment difficulties, but looking to the future of our business, I am announcing we will have an intake of 20\\u201330 first year apprentices in September. \\u2018We still have nearly 200 young people undergoing training on this site and although it continues to be less than in earlier years, because the business scene has changed, our overall commitment to training and development certainly has not.\\u2019 BAe made apprentices completing their training redundant a couple of years ago, but made every effort to find them alternative jobs within the group or with other companies. The move was welcomed by Airbus unions convenor at Broughton Mike Nesbitt. \\u2018We want to keep open the training school and this also helps local colleges. \\u2018Whether there will be any jobs for them at the end of the day is too early to say but at least they will be getting quality training which can be a kick-start in life.\\u2019 Jubilation as schools are saved from axe By Emyr Williams Daily Post Correspondent THERE was jubilation last night after Gwynedd councillors threw out controversial plans to close three village schools. Such was the opposition to the plan for closure of a school in the Bro Dysynni area of South Meirionydd, put forward by an education authority panel, that one senior councillor, Dr William George, described the vote in the county council chamber as the \\u2018most sweeping\\u2019 he had ever come across. More than 100 parents and children from Abergynolwyn, Llanegryn and Llwyngwril made the 100-mile round trip to Caernarfon to show their opposition to the plan to close their schools and establish a new area school at Bryncrug. The county's schools reorganisation panel chairman, Coun Dafydd Orwig, urged members of the county's education committee to accept the recommendation, which, he argued, would be for the benefit of the children's education. But the recommendation was thrown out by an overwhelming majority, with only Coun Orwig and education committee chairman, Coun Handel Morgan, voting to close the three schools. Coun Jim Knowles said: \\u2018We all knew that this proposal would not go through, and it is now clear that we should not be pursuing a policy of closing schools.\\u2019 Handing over a petition opposing the closures, signed by more than 1,200 local people, Coun John Tudor said: \\u2018The fact that people from these three villages have travelled here today in two buses and seven cars to voice their opposition is a clear message to us all how the people of Bro Dysynni feel on this issue.\\u2019 The committee also agreed, by 39 votes to 17, to defer for 12 months consideration of a proposal to close the village school at Abersoch. Pupils protest against the closure plans outside Gwynedd education offices \\u2018Cancer best thing that ever happened to me\\u2019 By Andrew Forgrave Daily Post Staff NEW Zealander Mary-Jane Hilton means every word when she says cancer was the best thing that ever happened to her. When many women would have been devastated, the 50-year-old took the news that she had a malignant breast tumour in her stride. She saw it as an opportunity to take control of her life and set about tackling the crisis with positive thinking. That was three years ago and Mrs Hilton is now relishing her new role as fundraiser for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society. Sitting in her office at the historic Philharmonic Hall, she contemplates her newfound lease of life. \\u2018I know it sounds terrible but I'm awfully glad I had cancer it was the best thing that ever happened to me,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I now have a completely different lifestyle, with different sets of values. I am more content and I feel a lot happier. \\u2018As a fund-raiser, you can never take no for an answer and no one was going to put me six feet under.\\u2019 Mrs Hilton was a successful public relations and fundraising consultant in New Zealand when she learned she had cancer. After having her breast removed, she was then told the malignancy had spread to the lymph nodes under her arm. Chemotherapy was prescribed but three months later she decided to fight the disease with her mind rather than chemicals. \\u2018I took control,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018I believe cancer is a state of mind and can be defeated by positive thinking.\\u2019 The treatment was stopped and Mrs Hilton prescribed her own course of healthy eating and holistic medicine. After controlling her needle phobia through hypnotherapy, she travelled to America to study clinical suggestion techniques. Now she uses the same techniques to teach other women cancer can be beaten. But it is the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall which is benefitting most from her zest and drive. Yesterday, the European Commission announced a \\u00a32.5m grant giving the green light to the restoration of the grade II-listed building. And next year she has set herself the personal goal of raising \\u00a3500,000. Mary-Jane Hilton \\u2018Backdoor bid \\u2018claims to close down fire stations By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff FIRE chiefs have been accused of \\u2018back-door\\u2019 tactics in an attempt to close two fire stations in a review of station boundaries. The review would take away large areas covered by Buckley and Prestatyn retained fire stations. Councillors have now called for a full investigation before any action is taken. Buckley Coun David Messham said the reorganisation was being proposed without local councillors being aware. Prestatyn Coun Richard Edwards said some of the proposed changes were \\u2018ludicrous\\u2019. Both stations, manned by part-timers, were under threat of closure some years ago but massive campaigns secured their future. Chief Fire Officer Ken Hayton told Clwyd's environment and protection committee yesterday that after a review of fire cover last year he reassured councillors there was \\u2018no question of closing fire stations\\u2019. But the service had looked at 18 areas and applied a Home Office computer to determine which fire station turns out first to a fire. Variable travel times were calculated, including the time it could take for part-timers to get to their station. Mr Hayton last year voiced concern that some part-time stations occasionally failed to get any response, particularly in the day time and the nearest full-time station had to cover. Because it is calculated that a retained crew might take four minutes to get to the station the computer calculated other stations could respond quicker. \\u2018Buckley fire station has a proud record of getting to all fires. Computer models are wonderful things but they do not put people on the ground,\\u2019 said an angry Coun Messham. The proposal would take away from Buckley, Penymynydd, Penyffordd, Mynydd Isa, Hope, Higher Kinnerton, and Drury, yet leave it Bryny-Baal. \\u2018You have to travel through Mynydd Isa to get to Bryn-y-Baal,\\u2019 Coun Messham said. It looked like another \\u2018back-door method\\u2019 of closing the stations. \\u2018Ludicrous\\u2019 \\u2018We now have this ludicrous situation where if a fire broke out in one end of a particular street in Prestatyn, Rhyl fire engines will go to it and if it breaks out in the other end of the street Prestatyn will go to it,\\u2019 added Coun Edwards. In one case changes were being proposed because the computer calculated a difference in response time of about five or six seconds, he claimed. Mr Hayton said he would be willing to make a presentation of the computer findings to councillors and if the results could be challenged, they would be re-examined. The committee called for a special report on the matter. Golf guidelines aim to conserve county farmland for future Policy to control rural development By Emyr Williams Daily Post Correspondent NEW GUIDELINES for the development of golf courses in Dyfed are set to be approved by county councillors this week, following a period of public consultation. The new guidelines aim to give added protection to the countryside while at the same time promoting In drawing up the guidelines, planners accept that golf can have a major impact on countryside amenities, which, they claim, must be weighed against considerable economic and recreational benefit. Drawn up by Dyfed County Council, with help from the district councils, the guidelines recognise the rapid growth of golf. County planning officer Dave Bown, said: \\u2018At the present time, Dyfed is witnessing a considerable increase in the number of golf development proposals.\\u2019 The guidelines make it clear it is council policy not to permit golf development if it involves new buildings or associated development in the open countryside, and is unrelated to existing settlements. Golf developments likely to adversely affect the landscape will be resisted. There will also be opposition to the use of high quality agricultural land for golf courses. Subject to certain conditions, particular encouragement will be given to proposals where development utilises degraded land, and where the development would result in demonstrable improvements to amenity, landscape, nature conservation or public access. Golf development will not normally be permitted if it causes unacceptable disruption to the public enjoyment of rights of way. \\u2018For many of us the natural beauty of much of Dyfed's countryside remains undisputed, though few people nowadays accept that this will always be so, regardless of economic or other pressures,\\u2019 said Mr Bown. \\u00a34m \\u2018windfall\\u2019 to be spent on town, village revamp By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff DELYN has nearly \\u00a34m to spend on improving its towns and villages in ambitious plans for 1993\\u201394. But councillors are urging officials to get on with spending because the authority could go out of business in two years' time if local government is reorganised. Most of the money will find its way into Flint which is looking forward to a major town centre redevelopment supermarket, DIY store, smaller shops, fast food restaurant and new car park. Delyn was going to spend \\u00a31.25m in 1993\\u201394, but finds it has more than \\u00a32.5m unspent capital which it can carry over from last year's budget. Chairman of Delyn's development environment committee, Coun Gwilym Roberts, said: \\u2018It is a very exciting and ambitious scheme.\\u2019 The bulk of the \\u00a33.8m will be split between three towns: \\u00a32.3m to Flint, \\u00a3312,000 to Holywell and \\u00a3315,000 for Mold. Greenfield Valley will get \\u00a3212,000 and village enhancement schemes will get \\u00a354,000. But not everyone has welcomed the news. Coun Tony Chilton told the Borough's development and environment committee yesterday: \\u2018The benefits which are going to the towns seem very unfair, very biased. \\u2018More than \\u00a33m is being spent on the towns and just \\u00a354,000 on the villages. \\u2018People in rural areas pay council tax just like everyone else.\\u2019 Labour leader Coun Chris Bithell said: \\u2018We underspent last year by about 38pc. \\u2018We are probably in the last days of this authority and we want to make sure our schemes and aspirations come to fruition.\\u2019 Spending on Flint includes massive environmental improvements, clearance of the former Courtaulds' Deeside Mill, re-siting the town's football club and car parking. In Holywell it will be spent on car parks, bus station toilets and other environmental schemes. In Mold there will be major environmental improvements, pedestrianisation, improvements to the trader's hall and car parks. Gwilym Roberts Widow's nightmare as her baby fights for life By Carmel Brown Daily Post Staff A MOTHER is living in a nightmare from which her only possible escape is that her tiny daughter may win her fight for life. For Angela Allen had to abandon her vigil at the bedside of 10-month-old Laura in a Birmingham hospital to return to her St Helens home where her husband had been found dead in bed. Rob Allen, 41, is thought to have suffered a heart attack which his wife believes was brought on by the strain of their daughter's condition. But just two weeks before his death, the couple had been celebrating after a last-ditch nationwide appeal found a donor liver to save the life of their baby. Mr and Mrs Allen had been trying for a child for 19 years and were overjoyed when Laura was born. Sadly, their world was shattered when, within days of her birth, doctors told them their child had acute liver failure. Laura was admitted to Birmingham Children's Hospital for specialist treatment where Mrs Allen maintained a 24-hour vigil during the 12 weeks they waited for a liver to become available. And Mr Allen, dividing his time between his job and the hospital, constantly made the return journey from their home in Provident Street, Parr. \\u2018Rob was always so fit. I can't believe what I am going through. I just don't know how to think,\\u2019 said a devastated Mrs Allen last night as she prepared to return to Birmingham following her husband's funeral. \\u2018It must have been the tremendous strain he had been under worrying about Laura and trying to keep his job up. \\u2018It was non-stop and a terrible, terrible strain for him. The emotional pressure was just tremendous. \\u2018We were both so delighted when Laura had the liver transplant. It was the answer to all our prayers. \\u2018We thought all our problems were behind us and were looking forward to a new life. \\u2018But Laura developed complications. Her new liver took straight away but she had to go on a ventilator because she was having problems with her lungs.\\u2019 Mrs Allen was with Laura when his mother discovered her husband dead in their bed last week. \\u2018She is all I have to live for now. Doctors have given her more than a fighting chance and I just have that to cling to.\\u2019 Rob and Angela Allen with baby Laura soon after she was born Bridgewater Four \\u2018proved innocent\\u2019 By Heather Tyrrell Daily Post Correspondent THE families and lawyer of three men convicted of killing newsboy Carl Bridgewater yesterday handed in \\u2018new evidence\\u2019 to Home Secretary Michael Howard which they said proved their innocence. They presented him with a thick dossier containing new information about the alleged confession that led to the convictions. Michael Hickey, his cousin Vincent Hickey and James Robinson were jailed in 1979 for the murder of 13-year-old Carl as he disturbed their burglary at a remote farmhouse in Stourbridge, West Midlands in September, 1978. Patrick Molloy was convicted of manslaughter and died in prison in 1981. Michael Hickey's mother, Ann Whelan, who was among a large crowd of protesters outside the Home Office, said: \\u2018Our message is simple that we are not going anywhere. We are not going away. \\u2018They may as well give us justice now and exonerate these men from this horrific crime.\\u2019 Solicitor Jim Nichol said the main new evidence, never considered before, was that the confession by Molloy at the centre of the case was not a word-for-word record of what he said but the recollections of police officers present. He added that a prime suspect in the investigation, who had told police that he had no gun at the time of the murder, is now known to have possessed a double-barrelled shotgun at the time. And he said there was now further evidence to discredit a principal witness in the case as a liar and a cheat. Relatives of the men were confident the new evidence would eventually secure their release. Carl Bridgewater Solicitor Jim Nichol with relatives of the jailed men, from left, Ann Whelan, Anne Skett and Theresa Robinson at the Home Office yesterday Married couples pension rights will have to be faced in future WE have just about got used to the framework for personal and company pensions introduced in 1986, with its incentives for \\u2018contracting out\\u2019 of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) and the freedom to transfer pension rights from company schemes to personal pensions. But now even bigger and more drastic changes are on the horizon. One stems directly from Europe: thanks to a European Court Judgement. Britain is required to equalise pension rights between men and women. the other concerns division of pension rights between husband and wife. The Government has delayed responding to the need to equalise pension rights because it means equalising State retirement ages. At present these are 65 for men and 60 for women. Equalising at 60 is far too expensive for the Government to contemplate. But equalising at 65 would be very unpopular with women  Compromise Sooner or later and if not sooner, further references to the European Court are likely a definite decision will have to be made. Retirement at 63 is the obvious compromise solution. But since the private sector will then bring its normal retirement ages into line, this will involve complex adjustment of pension rights for everyone in work. Potentially an even bigger bombshell is about to burst on the vexed question of pension rights. It has long been recognised that women who devote years of their lives to bringing up children lose out in the pension stakes. Their husbands earn pension rights while they do not. If divorce follows, the husband keeps the pension rights and the wife has none. At present, English law does not recognise pension rights as an asset in the context of divorce settlements. And even Scottish law, where pension rights are taken into account on divorce, has no mechanism for transferring them from one person to another. All the judges can do is award a greater proportion of non pension assets to the wife to make up for her lack of long term security and if these other assets are small, the husband is still the winner. Now a report from the Pensions Management Institute has suggested ways of changing the law to bring pension rights into play. The aim would be to give the courts the right to divide pension rights, even if earned by one of the divorcing parties, between them. This would be done on the basis of the facts, in particular the period of time the marriage had lasted and the extent to which the wife had foregone the opportunity to earn pension rights while bringing up the children. The legislation would not affect the flat-rate State pension. Nor, at present, does it look as though it will be practicable to bring SERPS within the scope of the Courts. But all other pension rights, whether through occupational or personal pension schemes, would in principle be divisible. Protecting the position of women who work hard at being mothers is obviously a worthy social objective, and with no political dispute likely, the report's changes could be legislated within a year or two. Implications The implications for the future (any changes will almost certainly not apply to pension rights earned before the date off legislation) are enormous. Married people will have to treat the pension rights they earn as partly conditional on their remaining married. And the possibility, particularly for husbands, of losing a significant part of their pension rights on divorce will focus their minds on the value of those rights. Anglican-Catholic plan for new primary school Estate's joint venture \\u2018exciting\\u2019 By Malcolm Handley Regional Affairs Correspondent A UNIQUE project could mark Liverpool as the country's leader in school building trends. The city's education officials and leaders of Liverpool's Catholic and Anglican churches are considering a new \\u2018joint Christian\\u2019 primary school for the Croxteth Park district. Although a small number of inter-denominational schools have been built in the UK, they are normally the result of neighbouring schools coming together from weakness and threat of closure. The project under discussion for Liverpool comes from the confidence of two religions prepared to work together to build a new primary school. Liverpool's education officials are viewing the project as an exciting and dynamic venture which could set the scene for future plans. But Clive Lawton, head of educational services, said there was still a long way to go, and he warned against being carried away with a good idea if it were to impoverish the rest of the scheme. \\u2018The proposals have been fully thought through by the local education authority, the Anglican Diocese of Liverpool and Roman Catholic Archdiocese. \\u2018Proposals for establishing a joint trust and practical provisions for pupil places have already been prepared,\\u2019 he added. The proposal for a joint Christian voluntary-aided primary school goes before this afternoon's education planning committee. If the plan gets the go-ahead it will be submitted to the Department for Education and if approval is given the school could begin soon after that decision. Mr Lawton said: \\u2018It is an exciting initiative which could provide a dynamic role model for future co-operation in other parts of the city. \\u2018This is not a barrier smashing initiative. The two religions already work close together. It is a very positive proposal. \\u2018It is an exciting idea to serve Croxteth Park, one of the largest housing estates in the country. The idea suits the age and the city of Liverpool,\\u2019 he added. There are still a number of potential stumbling blocks beginning with today's meeting before the project could get the go-ahead. The developer of the site, Ideal Homes Holdings, has undertaken to reserve the site and provide it free of charge to the school trustees in addition to a one-off payment of up to \\u00a3150,000. \\u00a3650,000 bill sparks crisis Bombs probe costs may force police to cut back By Cath Steward Daily Post Staff CHESHIRE Police Force may have to reduce its manpower and police station opening hours because of the cost of the Warrington bombings. The force estimates that \\u00a3650,000 has been spent on the investigations so far. And Chief Constable David Graham has warned that if the Government does not provide extra money, drastic steps will have to be taken. Cost cutting measures would include: Reduction in police overtime the force is already running at below the minimum levels it considers necessary. Reduction in training. Cuts to police station opening hours. Reduction in the operations of special departments, including community liaison, and crime prevention. Cuts in the use of vehicles. Reduction of civilian staff. In his report to tomorrow's police committee, Mr Graham warns the cost of the investigations, without additional funding, could have \\u2018enormous implications.\\u2019 He says: \\u2018Already, in order to achieve a balanced budget, it has been necessary to freeze recruitment during 1993 of all police officer posts as and when they come vacant. \\u2018As it is impossible to reduce police strength any further to offset the estimated cost of the two major investigations, the force will have to implement some or all of the measures mentioned.\\u2019 The IRA bombings, which took place on February 26 and March 20, necessitated the setting up of two major incident rooms within Warrington Police Station, financed by the Cheshire Constabulary. Three arrests have been made in relation to the first incident when a policeman was shot and injured shortly before an explosion at the gasworks. Their trial is likely to cost \\u00a390,000. A further \\u00a360,000 is needed for continuing investigations into the second incident. The force has already spent \\u00a3428,000 on extra officers to deal with the second incident in which two children died and 53 people were injured. The Police Committee is expected to request a grant from the Government to cover the extra expense. Mountain search is suspended Concern grows for lone climber \\u2018lost\\u2019 in Alaska By David Greenwood Daily Post Staff HOPES were fading last night for an Anglesey man who has been missing in an Alaskan wilderness for five days. Keen mountaineer Thomas Hargreaves, 39, left to go on a day's hiking in an area frequented by grizzly bears last Thursday, but friends only reported him missing at the weekend. As his parents, Alan and Sybil, of Llangoed, Anglesey, waited anxiously by their phone for news from Alaska, the man heading the search confirmed last night that it had been suspended. State Trooper Chuck Lamica in Juneau said: \\u2018We have now suspended the operation and it will not start again until we get a new lead.\\u2019 He said Mr Hargreaves's bicycle had been found chained to a sign at the start of a trail, which winds its way through thick forest to the vast Mendenall glacier, just north of Juneau in south east Alaska. State Trooper Lamica added: \\u2018He has gone into a very dangerous area. Every year we have several people going missing there. Unfortunately, some are never seen again.\\u2019 He said searchers have had to fight their way through areas of dense undergrowth which can edge on to sheer cliff faces. They have even \\u2018spooked\\u2019 a couple of grizzly bears. Mr Hargreaves was believed to have been carrying ice-climbing equipment. State Trooper Lamica concluded: \\u2018We just hope he hasn't gone onto the glacier.It is filled with 400 ft deep crevasses, and is extremely dangerous.\\u2019 Mr Hargreaves, single, a graduate of Bangor University and a fisheries expert, has been a regular visitor to Alaska for the last four years. Michelle Ridgeway, one of Mr Hargreaves's friends, said: \\u2018He is very composed and calm.

Sefton Council officers are considering proposals to introduce the fun figures in Southport in a bid to help rejuvenate the town's shabby seafront area. However the plans have been branded \\u2018ludicrous\\u2019 by Southport 2000, a group set up to help preserve the town's heritage and restore it to its Victorian splendour. The argument is one of many currently raging between Sefton Council and people living in the town once known as the Garden City of the North. \\u2018Southport's seafront area is in an appalling state, it is disgraceful, but a few plastic dummies won't put the problem right,\\u2019 said Southport 2000's Tony Quirke. \\u2018We held a Victorian Fair at the weekend and many people who previously lived in the town and were back visiting couldn't believe how much it has deteriorated.\\u2019 The group, which boasts 2000 members, expressed fears that Southport's popularity as a holiday resort is in decline. And they claim that a council scheme to construct a concrete sea defence wall along the coastline will worsen the appearance of the area. \\u2018People are unhappy at the way the town is looking,\\u2019 said Mr Quirke. \\u2018The seafront area is run-down with too much concrete, the sea defence wall will act as a Berlin Wall cutting people off from the beach and the sea. \\u2018It will be a monstrosity and we will witness the end of Southport as a resort. \\u2018We believe that the seafront area should feature continental-type cafes, with an emphasis on families. The road could be closed off and the beach opened up and made more accessible. \\u2018We fear that the construction of a sea defence wall will pave the way for road and business developments and will signal the end of Southport as a resort.\\u2019 Imaginative However, Sefton's Chief Planning Officer Tim Cox refuted the criticisms and said that the fun characters were just one aspect of environmental art being considered for the area. \\u2018There are one or two places including Manchester which feature some very imaginative art. \\u2018We hope to embrace that artistic approach to make Southport more interesting and special. \\u2018The Council is working on re-generated Southport's seafront area. We are very conscious of the problems on the seafront but these have been recognised. \\u2018Coast defence work is necessary because the area is flooded 50 days of the year, and we have more chance of attracting business investment by removing the threat of flooding. \\u2018In order to keep the sea out we have to build a wall, but a promenade will be constructed above road level and people will be able to look over the wave wall.\\u2019 Sefton's Chief Tourism Officer Phil King is attending a conference in Scarborough and was unavailable for comment.

That error is the belief that there are only two possibilities for any event: either it will happen or it won\\u2019t. This is wrong. In fact, every event has three possibilities: it can happen, not happen or happen with modifications. The problem with this belief lies in the fact that we always think about events as if they were things, when in reality they are processes. Events have duration, time is necessary for them to take place and what happens at one moment doesn\\u2019t necessarily continue without interruption. Therefore the same event can happen again (or not) in different moments of its process, i.e. the event can have different outcomes in different times.\\nWe are used to thinking about objects as solid, stable entities, but this way of thinking is wrong when applied to events. For example, let\\u2019s imagine that you are on holiday and you are visiting some beautiful city. You enter a building and walk through it looking at all the paintings and statues. Then suddenly you notice something strange: one of the statues seems to be moving! When you look closer, you see that the statue has moved to another position; and you realise that your eyes deceived you because now everything looks normal again. What happened was just an illusion caused by the passage of time: since you had been observing the statue for a few seconds, you noticed that it moved from one position to another. If you had stayed in front of it longer, you would never have seen anything unusual.\\nIt is precisely this kind of experience that many people use as evidence against the existence of God. They say \\u201cHow could God exist if he allows suffering? Why does God permit evil?\\u201d These are questions that can be answered only by someone who understands how the universe works. It\\u2019s like asking \\u201cWhy do planets go around the sun? How did life originate? Where does energy come from?\\u201d These are questions that science cannot answer because they require knowledge beyond human comprehension. But there are other questions about God\\u2019s existence that don\\u2019t require such answers\\u2014questions like \\u201cIs God good? Is God loving? Does God care about me?\\u201d\\nThese questions may seem silly at first glance, but once you start thinking about them seriously, you realize that they deserve serious consideration. And indeed they deserve serious consideration because they involve issues related to morality and ethics\\u2014two topics that concern everyone regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.\\nWhen we talk about God being good, we mean that he acts according to certain principles which define what is good and bad in our world. A good person would never kill another human being except under extreme circumstances where no other alternative exists. Likewise, a good person would never lie, steal, cheat, or harm others unless absolutely necessary to save his own life or the lives of others. So if God acts according to these principles then he must be good too.\\nThis brings us back full circle to the idea of free will: if God knows everything then he knows whether or not we will do something right away before we do it ourselves. But then why does he allow us to choose freely? Isn\\u2019t this simply a contradiction?\\nIn order to explain why God gives us freedom despite knowing ahead of time what choices we will make, we need to consider another important aspect of divine omniscience: temporal continuity. As I mentioned earlier, every event has three possible outcomes: success/failure, modification/non-modification, or repetition/non-repetition. Since God knows everything, including future events, he sees each outcome separately rather than seeing all possible outcomes simultaneously. Thus when he observes my choice to buy ice cream instead of pizza, he does not see both options happening simultaneously; instead he sees only one option happening at a given point in time (i.e., after making my decision). Because of this temporal separation between causes and effects, there are cases where God knows ahead of time that I am going to buy ice cream but still lets me decide whether or not I want to do so. He wants me to exercise my free will freely so that I feel responsible for my actions. By doing so, I gain valuable experience and learn important lessons about myself and others.\\nBut sometimes God intervenes directly into my life because he knows that I need help. For instance, suppose that I am driving down the highway late at night when suddenly I lose control over my car due to fatigue or distraction and end up crashing into another vehicle. At that exact moment\",\n          \"The head then commented on his social development. He said that he was a good boy and that there were no problems with him, although he did say that there were some things he needed to work on. In addition to his behavioral issues, the principal also noted that he was having trouble with academics in certain subjects as well as attendance.\\nSo what do you think?

And with the increase in car-on-pedestrian collisions over recent years there are many more stories out there than ever before.\\nInjuries range from minor to severe and can include anything from bruising and scratches to broken bones and concussions.\\nOne thing that everyone agrees on: injuries sustained through accidents are not always apparent at first glance.\\nIn fact, sometimes people don\\u2019t realize they have been injured until days later when symptoms start appearing or worsening; this is especially true for those with underlying health issues such as diabetes or heart disease.\\nSo how do you know if your injury needs medical attention? What should I do after getting hurt in an accident? These questions may seem simple enough on paper but in reality they can be very difficult to answer without some guidance from professionals who have experience dealing with these types of situations regularly (and safely).\\nYou\\u2019ll find plenty of information here about what steps should be taken after suffering any kind of accidental damage\\u2014whether it was caused by another person or yourself!\\nSuffering Injury Through An Accident? Here Are Some Things To Keep In Mind\\nIf you\\u2019re reading this, chances are good that you were involved in an accident. You may be feeling a little sore and confused, wondering what happened and what to do next.\\nHere are some tips for handling the situation:\\nCall 911 immediately if anyone has been seriously injured or killed in the crash. The police will take care of investigating the scene, while emergency responders can provide medical assistance if needed. If it turns out that no one was seriously harmed during the collision, make sure both drivers exchange contact information so insurance companies can follow up later on any damages or claims made against either party.\\nGet checked out by a doctor right away if there are signs of serious injury like bleeding from open cuts or broken bones; otherwise wait until tomorrow morning when most hospitals have extended hours available (but still check with yours first!)\\nYou should also take photos of the scene before leaving\\u2014this helps prove fault later down the road if necessary; however remember never touch anything near where blood might spill onto surfaces unless absolutely necessary because cleanup costs could easily exceed $50K+ depending upon location/cleanup company hired etcetera\\u2026\\nFinally get legal advice ASAP regarding possible lawsuits against other parties involved including passengers who weren\\u2019t wearing seatbelts properly etc..\\nWhat Do I Need To Know About Personal Injury Lawyers?\\nPersonal injury lawyers represent clients who have been injured due to negligence on behalf of another person or entity. They help their clients obtain compensation for their losses, which can include medical expenses, lost wages and pain and suffering.\\nWhile many attorneys specialize in personal injury cases, others may handle business disputes or criminal matters. There are two main types of personal injury lawyers: plaintiff\\u2019s counsel and defense attorneys.
