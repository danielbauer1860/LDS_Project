This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

Susanna's one  doesn't really work at all, but  my one's just like  lukewarm. Oh well, let's have a look. Let's have a look at this  So  then, this we did, we did try to pu well, as I say, with the trouble we had upstairs, we just thought it just wasn't worth our while to sort of mess  No. around and try and do any more. No, no. That's right. Cos we just got a real fright  when we couldn't stop the water pouring out. Oh. It's the little washer thing. Just turn the tap. Well I'll get cleaned. Come on, you take the stuff down and rather me just try and .   And then er, once I've done that I've gotta nip up the top and get a comb.

It's a sa kinda ratchet type thing. Oh. Just that I think Susanna wants  to spanner to work, her bike's not here otherwise I'd have  if she gets back in time, fair enough. Just  thingie that Still, do you think you better  bleed it completely and let all the water out? No, not let the water out, you let the air out. When you bleed  Oh I see. it you let the air out, that's what, that's the idea behind it. Oh I dunno, I don't know what we did at that Oh it's alright. but it just doesn't seem to be working very effectively. I mean, obviously it's off now but erm Is Angie's one is really like hot and will dry things  whereas this one takes a bit longer. Hello? That's got a  a key down there. Oh. Oh.

Or put bits on your plate and then  just like put  this is a, I think this is a lime one. Mm! They taste a bit different actually to the ones we had. They don't like, used to have a little  . That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting.

Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm.

Well it's a  It came at the right time. E each of them  approved. Yeah. Am I still covered under BUPA? I think so. Erm, I, I wa , when I get into work on Monday I'll have to find out. I'm not ill or anything  so don't worry at the moment . Er, but I , I, I, I think  erm  I think had it out up until Robert is baby. He, he's joined his own wo , he's joined his own. He joined his own, but I mean when he was at college. Yeah. I think he said he was covered actually. Well I don't know.

It's a very good thing  That's right. if you've got  the money, sort of, the means to do it Well I think  then do. the bank pays and it  Yeah. comes out from  from  Ye  from my tax. Yeah. I do , I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health  in this kind, but to  know that you're covered rather  Yeah. than er Oh yeah. er ha , have problems  er er er, er when, when you  Definitely  require something. It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm.

It's the Ah perhaps to the toilet. There's loads er like, in the window  when we, like  newspaper articles and  things where it's been recommended and stuff. Ah I see. For, you know, they all, all put them up. Well d'ya know what I haven't to your place yet, the, fireplace. I haven't put the  up. Oh yeah. Well you can do that before you go. I just hate lying, when you suddenly hear these things come down on, just have visions of like a  a  po pouring out. Yeah I, I, I think what it is, it probably needs a clean. Definitely. And er  I was gonna, er er, look up the thing. Don't, it doesn't work apparently. Cos Jim who was in there last year said it didn't work when he was there. Oh oh. So I don't, I don't know if it's  attached or  anything, I don't know. I'm not sure. I haven't been gassed yet anyway,so   I don't think any gas or anything's coming out. No. And you'll find your stuff's  staying there? No I kept a couple    of newspapers but er Well I've, I, I bought a stack with me in fact  It's . so, so, if I I know, I wondered why you brought the Gazette, I thought  strange!

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s \\u2014 one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs \\u2014 one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with \\u2018care in the community\\u2019 in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite \\u2018round the clock\\u2019 care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to \\u2018treat\\u2019 children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for \\u2018partially hearing\\u2019 children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough \\u2014 an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to \\u2018have a go\\u2019 and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him \\u2014 this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist \\u2018therapy\\u2019 time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of \\u2018special needs\\u2019 varied widely in the questionnaire responses \\u2014 some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: \\u2018A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had \\u2018specialist\\u2019 training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the \\u2018special needs\\u2019of a child rather than on \\u2018total needs\\u2019. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to \\u2018have a go\\u2019, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies \\u2014 for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities \\u2014 one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds \\u2014 an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be \\u2018practicable\\u2019; and that \\u2018segregation is a way to later integration\\u2019. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and \\u2018opting-out\\u2019 under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved \\u2018against the tide\\u2019. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources \\u2018in the interests of the child\\u2019: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference \\u2018A place For All Our Children\\u2019, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a \\u2018learning difficulty\\u2019. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts \\u2014 first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document \\u2014The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap \\u2014 an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their \\u2018referral schemes\\u2019 adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate \\u2014 health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county \\u2014 special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short \\u2018special needs\\u2019 courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration. LIFE AFTER SCHOOL An international perspective on transition John Fish In this chapter John Fish draws on his experience working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to provide an international perspective on the opportunities in work, training and education for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties. He discusses the need for improving education and training and the way the contexts for transition to adult life have changed in the United Kingdom. He argues for the coordination of agencies involved in supporting young people and considers the major issues these agencies need to address. A number of initiatives in Europe and the United States are described. Finally he considers the part education should play. INTRODUCTION Transition from school to adult and working life has been receiving increased attention in most developed countries over the last decade. At first this was because of high levels of youth unemployment and latterly because of demographic trends. These show a growing number of older people entering active retirement and much smaller youth age groups entering employment. As a result it is important to create as many wage-earners and taxpayers as possible. A smaller labour market creates a window of employment opportunity for minority groups, including those who are disabled. It presents a chance to establish employment as a natural conclusion to education and training for these groups. In many instances expectations have been too low. When decisions about employability are based on school performance rather than on work experience, training opportunities are often limited. Recent developments have shown that appropriate education, training and direct experience of work and living away from home, can enable a very significant proportion of those with severe disabilities to maintain themselves in employment and independent life. For more than ten years the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been studying aspects of integration and transition for young people who are disabled. A number of reports on issues and innovations have been published (OECD 1986, 1987, 1988). Although the cultural traditions and education and social systems in OECD member countries vary there has been wide agreement about the importance of transition and the nature of the process. The work has led to the development of a conceptual framework for a period which is both a phase and a process. It is a time-phase between childhood and adulthood and a process of changing from a pupil to an independent working adult. There is also agreement about many major issues which need to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of effective innovations which have been studied in detail. If the handicapping effects of disabilities are to be minimised, appropriate education, training and support been the early teens and the middle twenties is essential. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The educational achievements of nearly half of all those completing the compulsory school period in the United Kingdom leave a lot to be desired. In addition, the academic standards of those receiving special education in secondary and special schools are not always impressive. It is one of the inequalities of the education system that the more successful you are the longer you can remain in it and thus delay independence and entry to work. Higher and flexible skill levels are now required in the labour market \\u2014 an objective endorsed by both the CBI and TUC (CBI 1989). This is a major reason for attention to transition. But, as a recent OECD publication Labour Market Policies for the 1990s (OECD 1990a) has shown, the United Kingdom, of all member countries, had the second lowest percentage of young people in full- or part-time education at the age of 17 in 1986 \\u2014 7. Although there has been some improvement, comprehensive preparation for an adult life, which includes employment, is not readily available to all who might need it. In a European context there are many countries where a high proportion of the school population stay in school or technical education until after the age of 18. In Scandinavia and North America it is rare for young people with severe disabilities to be expected to enter employment and to live independently until after education and training up to the early twenties. THE CHANGING CONTEXTS There is new legislation affecting every aspect of transition in the United Kingdom. Those responsible for post-school education cannot ignore the changing context in which their work takes place. The Education Reform Act 1988 creates a new basis, the National Curriculum, from which to develop the further education contribution. It also creates a new framework for further and continuing education where marketing, effective performance and an appropriate response to community needs are increasingly important. Social and Health Services have the Disabled persons Act 1986. The parts  being implemented require that a life (transition) plan be prepared with individuals in collaboration with other agencies. Sections concerned with the representation of disabled persons' interests are not being implemented at present. The Children Act 1989 also requires greater cooperation between departments where the needs of children with disabilities are concerned. This will be particularly true in the final years of school and in the initial preparation of an individual transition plan. \\u2018Care in the community\\u2019, in whatever form it is introduced, will have a significant effect on transitions. The movement of individuals from institutional care to supporting arrangements in the community, the support of more people in their own homes, and the general management of disabilities by social services through individual care packages all create a new context to which a contribution from further education and training will be essential. Changes are also taking place in the benefit system which it is hoped may provide more flexible support for those who are disabled, and enhance their employment possibilities. Finally, new employment and training arrangements are being introduced through Training and Enterprise Councils. These will influence what education and training is available to support transition, how it is managed in an area, and who has access to it. Education can only contribute one element to successful transition. To be really effective, lecturers and tutors must be sensitive to the contexts in which their institutions function and work closely with other training partners towards common ends. COORDINATION AND CONTINUITY Although an individual makes many important transitions in a lifetime, that from school through adolescence to adult life is one of the most important. For a young person with a disability or learning difficulty this transition is crucial. Transition is a personal and confused process for the individual but for national, local and voluntary departments and agencies it is a period of divided responsibilities and fragmentation. During the compulsory school period there are usually only two centres, home and school, which coordinate services for children. After that period there are many independent contributors. The secondary school, the further education college and the adult education service, health, social and employment services, all have potential contributions to make as have voluntary agencies. This confusion between providers is compounded by the different definitions used by departments and agencies to identify their clients. For example, Education Acts use relative definitions of performance separating disability and performance but the 1986 Disabled persons Act uses 1948 social security definitions of disability. Some definitions may be administrative, others functional and some may encompass a wider group than others. After school, individuals can  move into and out of departmental definitions. There are also attempts by agencies to establish an ownership of clients. This is particularly evident where funding to agencies depends on clients served. This may involve developing life plans with the individuals for whom they are responsible in isolation from other agencies. With so many players, in addition to the most important one \\u2014 the young person \\u2014 it is not surprising that there are no clear aims for the transition process. Indeed, in many countries, one government department may be paying huge sums to enable those with disabilities to become employable and to live independently while another is paying out larger sums as long as they remain dependent and unemployable. Even if a coordinated approach to transition is difficult to achieve it should be possible for all concerned to agree a broad range of aims for transition. The OECD/CERI programme (OECD 1986) has identified four general areas in which detailed objectives should be developed: Employment, useful work and valued activity. Personal autonomy, independent living and adult status. Social interaction, community participation, leisure and recreation. Adult roles within the family including marriage. Progress towards the achievement of these aims requires inter-agency collaboration. To pursue one aim, such as employment, in isolation from the others, such as the ability to travel to and from work and get on with other people, is ineffective. Continuity is another significant ingredient in effective transition. OECD/ CERI work has identified three stages of the process \\u2014 the final school years, further education and training, and the early years of employment and independent living \\u2014 between which a continuity of approach is vital. MAJOR ISSUES IN TRANSITION A number of issues are common to national and international contexts. They provide a useful agenda for discussion: The starting point Consideration of the process of transition needs to begin in the early years of secondary education. The place of education is also important. Attendance at a special school may automatically limit the choices subsequently offered to individuals when expectations are low and stereotyped. The importance of further and continuing education is that valuable opportunities can be offered for individual self-appraisal and for the reassessment of potential together with the recognition of previous learning. Inter-agency planning and collaboration The United Kingdom is not alone in having traditional areas of responsibility and means of allocating resources which mitigate against joint planning and collaboration. Responsibility for individuals may be handed from one department or agency to another or individuals may be left to find their way through a maze of fragmented information, responsibilities and opportunities. Empowerment To fail to make a distinction between a disability and its handicapping effects at different times and in different situations may limit expectations. Effective education, experience and training can significantly reduce the handicaps which may arise from disabilities. Similarly, a lack of knowledge about the nature of transitions and uncertainty about relevant goals for those with disabilities may inhibit progress. Professional and agency ownership of clients is also a major barrier to empowerment. Transitional programmes should develop self-advocacy (FEU 1990a) and should result in the individual being supported and empowered to make decisions and plan his or her life. But the shift of power from parents and professionals to individuals with disabilities, especially those who require considerable physical care, is difficult to manage. Professionals and services have to manage the dual, and often conflicting, roles of support and empowerment. Ambivalence and uncertainty in departmental and agency policies and in the aspirations and practices of professionals, together with uncertainty about client demands, are all factors which work against empowerment. Work with parents Little professional work with parents is undertaken after the compulsory school period. Parents have a crucial role to play in preparing their children for an independent adult life but may in practice unwittingly inhibit that progress. As work for the Further Education Unit (FEU 1990b) has shown, sensitive support is necessary to enable many parents to face the issues arising from their children's autonomy, empowerment and adulthood. Supporting arrangements are rarely readily available. The importance of parental support in effective transition cannot be overestimated. Assessment Transitional needs can only be met by assessment which both avoids categorisation and looks at all the future needs of the individual. Assessment should be concerned with potential and the future education, training and support an individual might need. It is also important to recognise that, for many of those with disabilities, performance in one situation, such as school, is not always a good guide to performance in real living and working situations. Too often decisions are: 1 based on past performance; 2 confined to the requirements of one sector, e.g. education or employment; and 3 seldom based on experience and training in real situations. New legislation lays particular stress on appropriate assessment. It is becoming increasingly clear that a transition plan, developed with the individual during the final years of schooling, to which all agencies agree to contribute is the only practical way of coordinating local services. Continuity of support In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, continuity of support for disabled individuals or their families through transition is rarely available. The development of appropriate mechanisms to initiate and sustain the continuity of support and funding is a problem common to OECD member countries. There is a need to provide a single point of reference (an individual guide or facilitator or a recognised team) for young people and their families throughout transition. Professional rivalries often prevent a single person being the means by which services to meet individual needs are facilitated. It is also necessary to understand that many people with disabilities are apprehensive of well-managed services providing continuity. Such services may be seen as diminishing personal control and choice. INNOVATIONS AND INITIATIVES There are a number of interesting initiatives in the literature including those in the United Kingdom. Those reported here are from other countries. This is not because they are immediately transferable to this country but because they illustrate particular features of transition. The final years of school The work of Sailor and Wehman in the United States (Sailor et al . 1989, Wehman et al . 1989) stresses the importance of an effective programme for individuals in high school. The Comprehensive Local School (Sailor et al . 1989) gives details of school programmes. Students with severe and profound disabilities and learning difficulties are entitled to attend high school up to the early twenties in the USA. Thus, the further education element in the United Kingdom is completed in the school  system although community colleges do similar work, often with an older age group, in the United States. Sailor's book sets out a systematic training programme for young people with severe disabilities (SLD in this country) based on modified behavioural approaches. This starts in the early teens and takes students into real living and working situations. Experiences in travelling, shopping and taking part in recreational activities in the community are carefully planned with clear behavioural objectives and criteria. Vocational preparation is done in real situations in the community but use is also made of situations within schools to learn social and work skills. An individual transition plan The Individual Education plan (IEP) is a central feature of special education in the United States. An Individual Transition plan is now being introduced to follow this. The purpose of such plans is to coordinate the contributions of different agencies towards agreed transition goals which have been planned with young people and their families. The features of such plans and examples of them can be found in the books of Wehman and Sailor. A guide or point of reference Because of the variety and confusion of possibilities and responsibilities after the compulsory school period the need for a guide has been widely recognised by young people and their families. In a study published by OECD/CERI a number of examples are given (OECD 1990b). One which has received considerable attention is the Kurator system in Denmark. A Kurator is similar to a specialist careers teacher with additional contributions to make after school. The Kurator is a member of the school psychologist's team who teaches children with special educational needs and is responsible for their careers education and work experience. He or she has a number of non-teaching hours for work with young people and their families after they leave school. The time available and balance of the Kurator's work may vary from one municipality to another. Support can be offered for up to four years after school. The Kurator is a facilitator who works on request with young people and their families. Supported employment One of the most significant developments has been the increasing open employment of young people with severe disabilities, particularly severe intellectual disabilities. Research in the United States has shown the inadequacy of the sheltered workshop model where commercial objectives limit access for those with severe disabilities and where transfer to open employment is very limited. Supported open employment is much more successful. The Genoa approach is  one identified by the OECD but there are others in the United States. The importance of the Genoa experience is that it has the backing of employers and trade union organisations. Young people are placed in open employment and trained and supported by social service teams. Salary is paid by the province or state for the first year after which the employer accepts responsibility. Support teams work with employers and fellow workers in a training programme and are also on call if there are problems. Results are impressive. In a city with 12 per cent unemployment 300 recent placements have resulted in an over 90 per cent job retention rate after the first three years of employment. THE ROLE OF POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION It is important that those concerned with post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties are informed about the context in which they work and have a grasp of the essential features of transition. They also need to be conversant with the main developments taking place in further and continuing education. Many of the features of effective special education, such as individual programmes and the management of a wide variety of learning rates and styles, are now expected in the mainstream of education and training \\u2014 for example, work in the Teaching and Vocational Educational Initiative. The labour market will need to make effective use of the smaller groups leaving school. To increase the labour force will require that the potential of minority groups, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, is recognised and that appropriate training and support for them is made available. The possible introduction of individual education and training vouchers for school leavers will also provide education and training with a new challenge. Unless the youth group has adequate guidance and counselling, individuals may find choice difficult. Vouchers may also limit the opportunities of those with special needs unless their value is enhanced to make provision of good-quality training attractive. A recognition that education post-school is a shared responsibility is vital. Parents, social workers and other carers have an educational role as do vocational training staff, employers and employees. This means that lecturers and tutors should work with them to develop programmes and curricula. But, above all, responsibility must be shared with the young person. The development of self-presentation, self-advocacy and of self-directed learning should all be central features of this phase of education. Supporters of those with special needs should be exemplars of such good practice. Developments of this kind have been initiated and sustained, in recent years, by the Further Education Unit. Its publications (FEU 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990c) are an important source of guidance and good practice. CONCLUSIONS Post-school education for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties has had to be fought for. In the past the case has been based on the wish to delay in unstimulated life it home or admission to a training centre. Now the grounds are more positive, namely the right to be considered for employment and as a contributor to the economy. For the individual, employment may represent the most potent symbol of adult status and integration into the community. What is being sought by many is equality of opportunity and access. However, there are also positive grounds for governments to invest in education and training for independence and employment. Research in Scandinavia and the United States has identified the cost of lifelong dependent care for those with disabilities as something developed economies cannot sustain in the future. Only by enabling those with disabilities to contribute, if they wish, through independent living and paid employment, will the increased percentage of ageing people be able to receive the support they expect and need. Thus, the charity image of disability must disappear. Higher expectations and effective post-school education for those who have received special education in school is not a luxury but an economic necessity. The form that post-school education should take is a matter for major discussion beyond the scope of this review. The rhetoric and reality of transition to adult life Jenny Corbett and Len Barton In this chapter Jenny Corbett and Len Barton take a critical look at the concept of \\u2018transition into adult life\\u2019 for young people with disabilities and those categorised as having learning difficulties. They argue that the barriers to participation which exist in society should be given greater recognition. They discuss the approaches and difficulties encountered in further education and youth training. They describe a reality in which pressures to exclude and marginalise young people with disabilities or those categorised as having learning difficulties, are still very strong. INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the currently popular notion of \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 in order to illustrate the complex and contentious nature of integration into adult life. It is a process of transition which all young people have to pass through but which is experienced differently as a result of such key factors as class, race, gender and disability (Cross and Smith 1987, Griffin 1985, Willis 1977). Integration into adult life is constricted within social and economic boundaries. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 involves a wide diversity of progressions beyond school into further education, training programmes, employment and community living. The extent to which individuals are able to participate in employment, leisure and social interaction, for example, will be an indicator of the reality of their \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. This broad view offers a wider concept of \\u2018integration\\u2019 than the narrow educational framework which predominantly confines debate in this area. It also places \\u2018transition\\u2019 in a political arena in which the tensions between rhetoric and reality are highlighted. We are concerned to challenge the extent to which those involved in this restricted form of transition are offered any real choices in decision-making. CONCEPTIONS OF \\u2018TRANSITION' A failure to address the nature of the society into which integration is being advocated reveals the fundamental weakness and inadequacy of much of the  literature dealing with this issue. If integration is seen merely as a response to individual needs, then the unequal, offensive and divisive nature of society remains unchallenged. Given the degree and stubbornness of such inequalities, the topics that concern us are those of power, choice, entitlement and social justice: issues of rights, not needs. The question of how to empower those people marginalised through disabilities and learning difficulties is, thus, a central one. Government documents and official statements concerning integration are replete with romantic and ill-defined language. The Warnock Report, for example, contends that there is a widely held and still growing conviction that, so far as is humanly possible, handicapped people should share the opportunities for self-fulfilment enjoyed by other people. (DES 1978: 99) and the Council of Europe's Report on Measures to Promote the Social Integration of Mentally Disabled People states that: The integration of mentally disabled people into society means that persons with mental handicaps of any degree should be able to live as normal a life as possible. (Council of Europe 1986: 9) just as with these statements about integration, an unchallenged view of \\u2018normality\\u2019 is subsumed within the rhetoric of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. Adulthood is, thus, largely perceived in consensual terms with the emphasis being upon enabling the individual to be \\u2018as normal as possible\\u2019. \\u2018Normality\\u2019 is a nebulous concept unless we ask whose normality is to be valued and emulated? As it is professionals who generally define what they regard as \\u2018normality\\u2019, this allows limited scope to negotiate flexible boundaries to accommodate a range of perspectives. Abberley (1989) argues that the specific form of normality being advocated becomes disabling in itself as it inhibits expressions of difference. He claims, moreover, that such a view is not only profoundly mistaken as to the source and nature of the multiple disadvantages experienced by disabled people, but that its propagation, in the context of modern Britain, serves not to combat but to perpetuate the oppression of disabled people. (Abberley 1989: 56) The argument of achieving \\u2018self-fulfilment\\u2019 and of \\u2018living as normal a life as possible\\u2019is seriously flawed when set against the context of an environment that is essentially oppressive and unadaptive and in which professional power establishes and perpetuates patterns of dependency. Opportunities for meaningful decision-making on the part of marginalised groups are largely cosmetic. Barnes (1990) made a recent study of the role of day  centres for disabled young people, in which few opportunities were offered for significant decision-making despite the operation of ostensibly progressive policies. This research illuminated the contradictions of a transition from passive schooling to day centre provision. Where young people were not used to making independent decisions and had become conditioned by special education, they found this move into a more adult environment difficult to adjust to. Staff encouraged debate but these users  appeared to have little interest in the sort of discussion groups generally seen as furthering mutual support and understanding\\u2026 The more able in the group felt they \\u2018couldn't tell us anything we don't already know\\u2019 or they were \\u2018depressing\\u2019, while the remainder said that they did not like them because they made them feel inadequate. (Barnes 1990: 136) It is not only the limitations of the day centre model of care but also the legacy of segregated schooling which makes taking over control so difficult. \\u2018Transition to adulthood\\u2019 suggests a journey to a substantive destination to which we all travel. However, the real passage which most of us experience is unpredictable and irregular. Griffiths argues that Adulthood is not recognised as a single event evident to everyone. Instead, a number of small changes in status and recognitions of the progress towards adult status takes place over a number of years. (Griffiths 1989: 5) There is not one form of adult status but a hierarchy which reflects the way in which society values different groups. for those at the lowest levels, the quality of this transition places them in a severely restricted form of \\u2018adulthood\\u2019. For an increasing number of young people, \\u2018transition\\u2019 is into vagrancy. Recent research has illustrated that the raising of the minimum age of entitlement for Income Support in 1988 has forced young people to be dependent on their families and has inhibited their transition to adulthood (Harris 1988, Whynes and ferris 1990). The majority of those young people who leave home to live rough are found not to have chosen this course but, rather, to have had it thrust upon them by circumstances. Hostels which offer short-term care for the young homeless find their clients are usually the most vulnerable and difficult (Hutton and Liddiard 1990). This form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 from residential care or the family into homelessness can instil a sense of despair and dependency which becomes habitual. Wallace and Cross (1990) suggest that young people in the 1990s are no longer setters of trends but \\u2018have become to some objects of pity and concern\\u2019(Wallace and Cross 1990: 7), more vulnerable and dependent than in the recent past. TRANSITION THROUGH FURTHER EDUCATION The whole concept of \\u2018transition To adulthood\\u2019 is problematic. The period affects all young people and involves a series of stages over a number of years, which are influenced by social and economic status. Yet for some it appears to form the focus of their curriculum. The curriculum for most young people who have left school involves academic or vocational courses which prepare them for specific adult roles. By contrast, a curriculum for young people with disabilities or learning difficulties often centres around a \\u2018preparation for adulthood\\u2019 as if this constitutes a recognisable area of study. In the curriculum framework for students with severe disabilities called Transition to Adulthood , Hutchinson and Tennyson (1986) acknowledge that, despite the title of their curriculum and their aim of extending choice, their actual capacity to change current opportunities for students on completion of the programme is negligible. Thus, the rhetoric of choice and entitlement is met by the reality of devalued citizenship. The language of such curricula denies the real economic and cultural oppression experienced by disabled people. Yet Hutchinson and Tennyson are well aware of the frustrations facing their students and seek to combat them: Jealousy and resentment between the different agencies involved with disabled people are often deeply entrenched and extremely difficult to break down. \\u2018Who pays for what\\u2019 often results in essential facilities or care being postponed or withheld indefinitely whilst the \\u2018professionals\\u2019argue the case amongst themselves. Alternatively, in the present economic climate, the power relationships between the different agencies may result in professionals vying to serve the needs of prospective clients since they have vested interests in defining the needs of their clients and expanding the numbers they serve in order to safeguard their own jobs. It is all too easy for this system to lead to a \\u2018disabling\\u2019 rather than an \\u2018enabling\\u2019context for students' adult lives, thus negating the benefits of a college-based \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019course. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 68 \\u2014 9) The authors go on to offer examples of students whose transition from college has been one of experiencing limited choice and often unsuitable placements. They even suggest that Such problems lead us to question the purpose of a \\u2018Transition to Adulthood\\u2019 course. It is felt that much of the progress students make whilst in college will be lost if they are not able to go on to meet fresh demands in new situations. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) If this form of \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes simply a retrograde return to passivity, it can be seen as a complete negation of all that the college course sought to encourage: Indeed, it has been said by some professionals in the field that we are doing the students a disservice by attempting to break through their apathy since their main chance of happiness lies in their passive acceptance of traditional \\u2018care\\u2019 facilities. Naturally, we as a staff find this attitude totally unacceptable. If nothing else we hope that by attending college the students will have gained the confidence and determination to go out into the community and demand that changes be made. (Hutchinson and Tennyson 1986: 72) Within this framework, \\u2018transition\\u2019 becomes a new form of responsibility and awareness, a way of viewing the situation. A common practice of \\u2018transition\\u2019 is that from special school to college of further education. Despite a commitment to curriculum entitlement (FEU 1989), institutions have commonly narrowed opportunities by the provision of separate courses or by restricting the participation of disabled students in a full range of general education classes. Social and life skills classes have often been created with the overt intention of facilitating the integration of students with disabilities (Dee 1988), yet they may lack certification and have low academic status. Although notions of autonomy and self-advocacy are central to many courses, there is evident tension between the aims of course tutors and the constraints imposed by parents and post-college opportunities (Dee 1988, Wertheimer 1989). Such \\u2018ghettoisation\\u2019 is supported by the familiar practice of transferring special school staff and a skills-based curriculum into special needs departments in colleges. A move towards student autonomy might be seen in an increasing emphasis upon the value of students entering into negotiation about their individual programmes, including the assessment process. However, Major (1990) argues that inequalities of power between student and teacher mitigate against any real negotiation. fay (1988) also argues that \\u2018negotiating\\u2019 with students can be personally intrusive and involve a hidden assessment of \\u2018qualities such as\\u2018willingness\\u2019, \\u2018drive\\u2019, \\u2018reliability\\u2019and even \\u2018self-awareness\\u2019(fay 1988: 27). Fay contends that such activities \\u2018colonise private space\\u2019(Fay 1988: 27). An invasion of privacy into the lives of vulnerable individuals is masked by the rhetoric of empowerment with the implication that it is being \\u2018done with rather than to trainees\\u2019(fay 1988: 26). TRANSITION TO YOUTH TRAINING Another aspect of transition is that from school to youth training. This offers programmes in vocational areas such as carpentry, office skills, catering, hairdressing, building, word processing, banking, sport and the arts. These programmes are of two main kinds: the one based with employers offering the most favourable route to jobs; the other, workshop-based, simulating employment and with implications of unemployability. Hollands (1990) illustrates the  way in which young people themselves challenge aspects of the training programmes: Some young people refuse to accept that they are deficient in the skills and cultures necessary for many working-class jobs. As such, they often see through life and social skills training and develop common-sense critiques of the curriculum. (Hollands 1990: 73) In supporting a transition to adulthood, how does youth training differentiate between groups of young people? for some young Black trainees, disproportionately represented in workshop-based schemes, the programmes serve to shape them into acceptable employees within a market which discriminates against them and to ease them gently out of their aspirations into the reality of restricted choice (Corbett 1990). As this liaison officer recognised, the basic level of skills training equipped them only for unskilled work and they had to learn to cope with compromise: so that even if we get a young person coming out of the workshops that may not be the best electrician going, we can find them something in a related area \\u2014 an electrical warehouse, where their knowledge of the bits that they know will be put to good use and they'll still be in that environment they want to work in. (Liaison Officer 1988, in Corbett 1990: 97) This \\u2018transition\\u2019 is one of learning where you fit into society rather than one of practising choice. \\u2018Life skills\\u2019 training supports this delicate process: Perhaps, not surprisingly, in a short space of time life skills training has become detached from the wider objectives associated with liberal humanist education: the point being that teaching young people about society has been replaced by criteria designed to alter their relationship with it. (Gleeson 1990: 188) Youth training can act as a form of \\u2018moral rescue\\u2019 from the penalty of unemployment, in which trainees perceive their transition into training itself as a form of moral superiority: George, a former school truant and now a construction trainee, said: \\u2018At least I did something\\u2026but the others, you saw them at school, just lazy.\\u2019 Others spoke of their gratitude to YTS and how it \\u2018worked for me\\u2019. It was in this way that YTS helped to sustain an individualistic and divisive work ethic. (Lee et al . 1990: 133) Within this work ethic, girls are encouraged to accept tasks in Youth Training Scheme (YTS) institutional care programmes which prepare them for often  distasteful and uncomfortable future roles as unskilled care staff (Bates 1991). In exploring the ways in which young people are guided into employment, Bates recognises that. Young people do not \\u2018go gently\\u2019 into employment. The work required to bring them there is not a bloodless operation. (Bates 1991: 1) For some young people, especially those in areas of high youth unemployment who are attending special youth training programmes for trainees with learning difficulties, this operation may never succeed in bringing them into employment (Wilkinson 1990). Transition through training is shown to be a process in which vulnerable young people are stratified into the slots allotted to them rather than being engaged in real decision-making about future choices. CONCLUDING REMARKS Transition is shaped by different opportunities and experiences and is a development which highlights inequalities. for some young people with disabilities which require a high level of care, this stage can be one of experiencing frustration in the limits of housing provision and support services (Fiedler 1989). Their \\u2018transition\\u2019 may be no more than being found a placement in residential care after the completion of an independence training college course (Corbett 1991). The reality of their adulthood may include exclusion from the labour market (Oliver 1989). If they are fortunate enough to become involved in an initiative which supports their progress into employment, this can lead them into another level of experience. Newman (1990) described a young man with cerebral palsy employed as a council clerical officer on a Sheltered placement Scheme. He was assessed as only able to work at 50 per cent of the rate for the job and only half his wages were paid under the scheme. As it turned out, his skills on the job have led to the department trying to regrade him into a more demanding post. Without initial support, this transition would have been impractical. Class, race and gender differences can determine the quality of transition in terms of what training is provided and where it leads. The level of support which young people receive from parents and mentors will also have a significant effect upon the process of transition, for it is a stage in which their dependency is visibly apparent. The rise in youth homelessness is a testimony to the need for consistent support during this vulnerable period. Much of the rhetoric of \\u2018transition\\u2019 fails to recognise the complexity of the social world. It is only within this complexity that \\u2018transition to adulthood\\u2019 can be understood. Supporting special needs in further education Maureen Turnham Since 1983 Maureen Turnham has been a lecturer in a college of further education with responsibility for a group of students categorised as having severe learning difficulties who are on a \\u2018life-preparation\\u2019 course at her college. In this chapter she discusses her preconceptions and first impressions of further education, then describes her own and her students' experience of their course and their attempts to participate with other students in the life of the college. She questions the selection procedures for students with difficulties and disabilities and discusses the barriers to participation posed by the arrangement of the buildings and people's attitudes. She reviews her own changing perceptions in the light of a commitment to equality of opportunity for all learners. IMPRESSIONS OF FURTHER EDUCATION My mother saw it. My colleague saw it and cut it out for me. I didn't see it but when I was presented with the job advert from a local newspaper the words leapt out at me: \\u2018Lecturer: Special needs\\u2019 in the college in the borough where I used to teach before becoming a peripatetic home teacher for pre-school children. Lecturer! I remember, several weeks after my successful interview, discussing my impending change of job at a party with a neighbour who works at the local university. My quizzing about the intellectual world which I was about to enter with some trepidation left him with a wry smile, which puzzled me for some time after, as my na\\u00efvety about the world of further education lasted well into my early days in college. My initial perceptions of a college of further education might have begun on a lofty plane, but I was soon brought down to earth with a bump. Upon being introduced by the special needs coordinator as the new tutor to a group of students with severe learning difficulties, I heard several groans of \\u2018Oh no, we thought we'd got rid of you\\u2026\\u2019. Several of my ex-pupils, some of whom I'd first taught when they were 7 years old, grimaced at me as they carried on preparing their lunch. They had made the transition to college \\u2018inhabitants\\u2019 in the two years since I had left the borough. It was to take me some time longer to undergo the metamorphosis from a \\u2018teacher\\u2019 to a \\u2018lecturer\\u2019. Some of that initial group of  students and myself already had known each other for several years and knew each other 's families. They all knew my younger sister, for example. She went to a special school, and continued to be a voluntary helper at the school where I taught when I left. Some first impressions and, early experiences of college life remain clearly in my mind \\u2014 what was this new world where the academic staff all taught, but many of them were not \\u2018teachers\\u2019 like me but engineers or nurses or painters and decorators? My knowledge of the history of further education, and of how my college had evolved from a county technical college, was scant. I was thrown into a jungle of new jargon. The language of special education had long been tucked under my belt, but now I was faced with filling in timetables with terms such as\\u2018DD\\u2019 time \\u2014 departmental duties, to the uninitiated \\u2014 in other words, time when I was not actually in direct teaching contact with students. College induction programmes for staff new to FE were in their infancy at that time and I probably felt content in the knowledge of my own \\u2018expertise\\u2019. After all, I had nine years' experience in special education. Surely, further education could not be so different? THE DEVELOPING \\u2018SPECIAL NEEDS\\u2019 PROVISION Seven years later, my experience of further education has grown and my perceptions of it have inevitably changed. Our college's initial provision for \\u2018students with special needs\\u2019 was established in 1978 \\u2014 a \\u2018discrete\\u2019course for students with moderate learning difficulties or, in some instances, school leavers from high schools who needed extra support before joining training schemes. The lecturer appointed to teach the students, who was later to become the college's special needs coordinator, once told me about those early beginnings as \\u2018part of the Engineering Department, based in a hut on the field\\u2019. For a long time I assumed she was joking, but not only was I wrong, I was also ignorant of the hard facts of life about the value of students with special needs and the staff who work with them. Talking to colleagues from other establishments at a conference some years later, I was struck by the similarities in their early beginnings \\u2014 often in a portacabin or separate annexe from the main college building, or in accommodation previously occupied by a school. Stories of inferior accommodation, equipment and materials, effectively deemed to be \\u2018good enough\\u2019 for students with special needs, seemed to far outweigh reports of a stated commitment for those students being backed up by provision that was dignified and appropriate. The life preparation course In 1983 we began to provide a course for students with severe learning difficulties. This provision was established as a result of several pressures, not least of  all parental lobbying for an alternative option to adult training centres. For many young adults with severe learning difficulties this was not much more than a decade after they became \\u2018entitled\\u2019 to full-time education. A former school for children with severe learning difficulties, a single-storey building three miles from the main site, therefore became a college annexe. It began as, and has remained, the base for nursery nurse students and for \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 students (referred to not as \\u2018special needs\\u2019students but prefixed by the title of the course they are following \\u2014 the same as other students!). The building also houses the relevant staff, including the senior lecturer who is the college's special needs coordinator. Opportunities for the integration of students were present from the beginning. For instance, there is a shared student common room, shared toilet facilities for all students (there is one adapted toilet/bathroom), and equal access to facilities such as the juke box (donated by the Students' Union, but removed when it failed to show a profit!) and the vending machines. The annexe has few refectory facilities, and on some days it seems that the queue for the coffee machine snakes endlessly around the corridors. During queuing periods, there have been occasions when I have witnessed nursery nurse students, with the best of intentions, \\u2018helping\\u2019 life preparation students, for example by operating the machine for them or by \\u2018allowing\\u2019them to jump the queue. I have to admit that, in the early days, it was with mixed feelings that I intervened \\u2014 suggesting, for example, that life preparation students really ought to take their turn the same as anyone else. The mixed feelings were, perhaps, a little cowardly on my part. While I saw no justification for positive discrimination in the coffee queue, I was aware that prejudice can stem from the most unexpected beginnings. Something as innocuous as suggesting to another student that a life preparation student should be allowed to take the coins out of her purse unaided may, inadvertently, upset the nursery nurse student in the short term. However, in the long term, I feel sure that continuing input (both formal and informal) into initial nursery nurse training can only serve to extend students' knowledge about the nature and implications of severe learning difficulties. How nursery nurses and other students choose to use this knowledge is another matter entirely. Joint craft Conscious of our lack of truly integrated teaching sessions, and freshly inspired by a successful \\u2018joint\\u2019 activity weekend at a local Outward Bound Centre, we made plans to change the structure of one particular curriculum area. It was decided that a double staffed session of craft, with one group of life preparation students and one group of nursery nurse students would be on the timetable once a week. The nursery nurses were initially given a talk on the nature of what was, in essence, a pilot scheme for functional integration. It was explained that it was hoped that they would \\u2018befriend\\u2019 a life preparation student for craft sessions, working alongside each other on a variety of projects. The projects were pitched at different levels, so that in the strictest sense the students were working in a parallel fashion. Although this pilot was not monitored formally, it was hailed by participating students and staff as an unreserved success, generating a substantial commitment to equality for students with severe learning difficulties, and a sound knowledge, on a practical level, of many of their needs. One unexpected spin-off was the growth of a few genuine friendships. The increase in confidence in many of the life preparation students was another benefit. Flushed with success we repeated this timetabled session, with the original members of staff, the following year with different students. The results were disappointing. With hindsight, there were \\u2018rumblings\\u2019 from some nursery nurses during the early stages of the course, but the matter only came to a head when a small group of nursery nurses made a formal complaint to a course tutor. They felt that they were \\u2018not getting on\\u2019 with their craft work or were \\u2018held back by the students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. The outcome was that a second room was negotiated and the students returned to the pattern of separate and segregated groups. During a further meeting about the problems, some of the nursery nurse staff expressed their concern over the attitude of this group of students. They felt that their students are in the caring field and \\u2018ought naturally to empathise with students with severe learning difficulties\\u2019. I would question this, as I feel we are treading on dangerous ground if we even contemplate trying to impose our values in this way, however strongly we feel personally. It seems obvious to me now that several factors involved could have been given more thought. There could have been greater consultation with both nursery nurse and life preparation students and due consideration given to the fact that completed craft projects are an important part of a nursery nurse's final assessment. We now have an opportunity to benefit from lessons learned, as, during the past year, we have undertaken a pilot scheme to integrate life preparation students with Sports and Leisure students who are following a City and Guilds course. Feeling established Our life preparation student numbers have grown continually and encompassed students from outside the district as happens on other such courses. This was partly because our college's provision for students with severe learning difficulties was being recommended by careers officers from other authorities. A pat on the back! It felt like confirmation that we had got it right. This seemed to be further corroborated when we were invited to join the second phase of a research project being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the Further Education Unit. Other colleagues working in schools or adult training centres from our authority were also asked to participate, as together we had previously set up a voluntary curriculum development group to look at authority-wide provision for young people and adults with severe learning difficulties. This  group had met almost every week for nearly two years. The national research project resulted in the publication of New Directions: A Curriculum Framework for Students with Severe Learning Difficulties in early 1988 (Dee 1988). Curriculum principles From the very beginnings of the \\u2018life preparation\\u2019 course, we tried to write an independence curriculum, and to follow the principles of \\u2018normalisation\\u2019. Every opportunity to maximise the differences between school and college life was seized. For instance, the college day for life preparation students is the same length as for other students. The possibilities for integration, that do not exist in a segregated, all-age special school, are many \\u2014 as students begin to mix, sometimes for the first time, in a community setting with other adult learners. The college environment may offer less \\u2018protection\\u2019 than their school, but it offers the chance to broaden horizons. One example of this is in the chance to meet and work with non \\u2018special needs\\u2019 staff. Students have the opportunity to join the college library and are encouraged to join the Students' Union. They are given a copy of their own group's timetable, whether or not they can read, and they are timetabled in a variety of rooms, with different tutors on two different sites. Travelling is done on public transport \\u2014 we have a college minibus which tutors can book for residentials, visits and regular timetabled activities, such as the Leisure Centre. Supervisory duties at break and lunch-time are carried out by non-teaching assistants. In general, the staff/student ratio is rarely as good as in a school for children and young people with severe learning difficulties. However, as our special needs coordinator rightly emphasises \\u2018we are a college \\u2014 not an extended special school\\u2019. The whole ethos of a college of further education is different to that of a special school \\u2014 from the funding and the staffing to the size and complexity of the sites. We share the annexe base with nursery nurse students and staff. An early rule of thumb became \\u2018if the nursery nurses don't do it, neither do we\\u2019. We talked with our students about the freedoms of college life, and suggested that they might judge whether or not certain behaviour was \\u2018age appropriate\\u2019 by looking at the nursery nurses (incorrectly and na\\u00efvely assuming the latter would unfailingly provide the models we sought!). This mechanism ended in total failure when, after lengthy and various attempts to persuade several female life preparation students to give up wearing white ankle socks in favour of tights, short socks, mostly white, suddenly became very fashionable and seemed to adorn every other pair of ankles in the building. With hindsight, I question some of my early motives and certainly now see different ways of exploring choices with students. One route for beginning to make informed choices is through self-advocacy, where students are encouraged either to speak up for themselves or to use an advocate who speaks on their behalf. Self-advocacy complements \\u2018normalisation\\u2019 and it is an issue which, recently, staff have actively begun to promote. The Open University's Patterns for Living: Working Together has generated much interest in this area (Open University 1989). Selection procedures At present, we select students for the life preparation course, following a baseline assessment devised by myself and colleagues which is carried out during a links week when potential students attend college full time. We didn't have interviews, but a young person had to \\u2018gain' a place none the less, as we had criteria for entry onto the course. I suppose I felt that this fitted in neatly with the selection process for other students. Also, we had no \\u2018medical\\u2019 back-up, as is often the case in special schools, therefore we felt unable to meet the needs of students with profound multiple disabilities. I can recall talking to Lesley Dee, \\u2018New Directions\\u2019 project leader, about her teaching experience in South Thames college and her approach to \\u2018FE for all\\u2019. When she spoke about learning difficulties or special needs she included everyone, even young people with severe \\u2018challenging behaviour\\u2019. This represented a very different target group to the one with which I was familiar, and it seemed an alien approach to me. I was worried that it could dilute or blunt our provision. I thought that it undermined the satisfaction of \\u2018getting a place in college\\u2019 for students with severe learning difficulties. However, I now realise that perhaps the only person who felt intimidated by \\u2018FE for all\\u2019 was me. Our selection procedure has resulted in no places being offered to students with profound or multiple disabilities or severe challenging behaviour. Our selection procedure still exists, but I want to see it changed to one which is more equitable. National reflections currently focus upon the need for college to be \\u2018responsive\\u2019 in order to ensure that individuals can gain access to the curriculum \\u2018regardless of any disability or special learning need they may have\\u2019(FEU 1990: 11). In considering the issue of entitlement to access, my college would be required to look at two groups of learners hitherto excluded \\u2014 students with profound or multiple disabilities and students with challenging behaviour. The life preparation course, in its present form, is unlikely to meet their specific needs, but the curricular content could serve as a starting point for designing new provision which would. The possible stumbling blocks would be financial and attitudinal barriers to these learners. It is my belief that our life preparation students are not \\u2018valued\\u2019 by many colleagues, so how would they react to learners seen to be \\u2018less able\\u2019or more difficult to cope with? COUNTERING OBSTACLES TO INCLUSION There are a number of issues which still concern me about continuing education for students with disabilities, just as they did when I entered college life \\u2014 for example, the fear and ignorance that often surrounds this seemingly homogeneous condition known as \\u2018disability\\u2019, and the unmitigated prejudice and stereotyping of people who do not \\u2018fit\\u2019 into a mythical category commonly  known as \\u2018normal\\u2019. However, I hope I am not so complacent that I am unable to acknowledge the difficulties of trying to bring about change. It is a lengthy and wearing process. Attempting to challenge and change the attitudes of individuals who feel discomfort or exhibit prejudice when faced with the possibility, or reality, of encountering people with disabilities is both a responsibility in my job and intrinsic to my personality. I believe in the precept of \\u2018person first, disability second\\u2019. I believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people, and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice. Our college, and authority, now has an equal opportunities policy document. I am departmental representative on the Equal Opportunities Sub-committee. When the college policy and the sub-committee was first constituted, I was enthusiastic \\u2014 teeth at last! Unfortunately, two years later, we are trying to rectify an original omission \\u2014 the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 does not appear in the policy document. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just insert the word \\u2018disability\\u2019 into the document, as there are several procedures which must be adhered to, not least of all submission to the governors appointed since financial delegation some months ago. I failed to realise for some considerable time the importance of commitment from the top down. Once again it was during some exchanges with colleagues from other establishments that I began to realise the significance of \\u2018who is on your side\\u2019. Senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues, in their own department/school/division or otherwise, that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system. Negative statements such as\\u2018I don't know how you can work with them\\u2019 or \\u2018they don't belong here \\u2014 this is a college\\u2019, which were once like a red rag to a bull to me, no longer insult or injure as they did. I have grown used to the fact that I will never \\u2018convert\\u2019 some colleagues however enthusiastic, persuasive or reasoned I am. I no longer vociferously challenge those who insult; instead, I may casually invite them to come for a coffee and see/meet some students. Alternatively, if faced with a determined \\u2018It's not on\\u2026 I/we are not trained/paid/ supposed to teach these students\\u2019, I do not launch into a tirade on equal opportunities but try to draw breath instead and substitute a concerned ear about the anxieties of dealing with students seen to be different. It's not always easy or straightforward, and I still have difficulty in dealing with such sweeping generalisations as: \\u2018he's a Down's Syndrome \\u2014 they can be very stubborn, can't they?\\u2019; \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2026they can be quite violent if they don't get their own way\\u2019. Apart from the danger in such misconceptions, the terminology used by some colleagues when referring to anyone with a disability can be disturbing. I refer to my students by name and would never refer to any of them as \\u2018a Down's Syndrome\\u2019, just as I would never refer to any of my friends who wear contact lenses as \\u2018a myopic\\u2019. Students with learning difficulties do encounter prejudice, and confronting prejudice is rarely an easy task. As a group, they are marginalised in a society that places a high value on being clever and articulate. Within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some name-calling or jokes at their expense. We do have strategies that can be used \\u2014 from advising the students with learning difficulties to ignore insults, to implementing the equal opportunities policy which finds such discrimination to be indefensible. Questions of physical access The physical barriers to integration for students who have special needs will undoubtedly continue to pose problems in my own establishment, and those of colleagues, and are due, not least of all, to the ever-increasing constraints of finances. At the time of writing, plans to join two buildings with a walkway to improve access to the second building, which has no lift, have been scrapped. In the current financial climate, which sees us wrestling with colleges managing their own budgets and, in our own authority, reeling from the outcome of poll-capping, the expenses involved in improving physical access are likely to be competing with numerous other worthy but expensive causes. Physical barriers to integration often receive much publicity. However, it is not good enough to assume that physical restrictions to access to college buildings can be removed, in one fell swoop, by the construction of a ramp or the fitting of a handrail. The ramp, for instance, needs to be of the correct gradient, something which, in my experience of discussing such matters with colleagues, appears to be overlooked with alarming frequency! I discovered that, for instance, one of our students was unable to propel her wheelchair up the ramped entrance to our annexe, a former special school building, without the dangerous likelihood of tipping backwards. A subsequent ramp built on to a fire exit out of one of the rooms was better, though the aforementioned student had long since left. Any \\u2018make do and mend\\u2019 philosophy which applies to facilities and provision for any group of learners, including students with disabilities, is regrettable and short-sighted. Regrettable because it compounds a belief that there is a group of learners with lower status that the rest because they have been labelled as having \\u2018special needs\\u2019. Short-sighted because no amount of patchwork planning can be a substitute for a blueprint for services that has commitment, consultation and collaboration ingrained, like a name through candy rock. THE FUTURE There are new developments ahead in FE, such as new funding arrangements, which I hope will not add to the difficulties of access for any student who may require specific support for learning. There are also planned changes within community living which are likely to have significant implications as \\u2018different\\u2019 client groups such as ex-patients from long-stay hospitals move into the community. The need for a student-centred approach, perhaps not always present in some sectors of FE, is likely to become increasingly vital to tailoring programmes to meet the individual needs of those learners not traditionally seen as \\u2018student material\\u2019. Very recently, some of \\u2018our\\u2019 students have, like many of their peers, \\u2018voted with their feet\\u2019. They did not turn up for sessions they considered boring and did not meet their needs. They are speaking up for themselves and expecting, rightly, that they will be listened to by staff and that their opinions will have the same validity as those of the next person. The current emphasis upon \\u2018empowerment\\u2019, and the belief that \\u2018the more self-empowered a person becomes, the more able he or she will be to enable others to be the same\\u2019(Fenton and Hughes 1989: 19), is effecting a shift in approach generally, and in my own personal practice, from a passive model of students. My earlier justifications of an elitist selection procedure for our target group of students are incompatible with my commitment to equality of opportunity. I obviously cannot swear allegiance to the principles of equal opportunities then justify the exclusion of some students purely because of the severity of their disability. However, the access route to our college for these students with additional difficulties seems likely to be long and winding, requiring commitment not only from staff such as myself, but also from those senior staff who are the policy-makers and who control the purse strings. Many changes would need to be made to meet the needs of those learners. These are likely to range from an amendment to our current equal opportunities policy document (correcting the omission of \\u2018disability\\u2019) to a need to employ more staff, possibly from another discipline such as health. In a climate of radical spending cuts, the latter seems highly unlikely. Putting theory into practice is far from simple. Nevertheless, my beliefs have changed over the last years and the message is clear: I no longer think in terms of\\u2018further education for not quite all\\u2019 but of providing access to learning for everyone. A hard journey in the right direction Experiencing life beyond an institution Linda Shaw In this chapter, Linda Shaw describes her experiences of supporting Elizabeth and Helen in their South London flat \\u2014 initially as a member of their team of workers and later as a friend. Her knowledge of and friendship with the two women also enable her to describe what life was like from their point of view. Elizabeth and Helen were living in the community after many years in an institution for people classified as \\u2018mentally handicapped\\u2019. Linda describes the details of their daily lives, the problems that arose in trying to set up a network of support that was sufficient, stable and yet not undermining of the women's growing independence, and the different reactions of Elizabeth and Helen to their new life. Despite the difficulties and the continuing insecurity of support, Linda concludes that life for Elizabeth and Helen has been improved by their time in the community and that the hard journey is worth it. INTRODUCTION Elizabeth and Helen moved into their own basement flat in an inner-city suburb in 1987. they are middle-aged and spent nearly thirty years together at the same mental handicap hospital but lived separately for the two years before the move into the community because Helen was transferred to a smaller institution. The move was part of the \\u2018community care\\u2019 initiative adopted by health authorities to provide housing and support services in ordinary settings for people with learning difficulties. I was a member of the health service team supporting Elizabeth and Helen at the time of the move and I have stayed in touch with them since, as a friend and advocate. I have written this account on their behalf, based on my knowledge of the women, observations of their lifestyle, and discussions with them and their support workers. The women's real names and some details about their lives have been disguised to protect their privacy. STARTING AN ORDINARY LIFE More than two years after the move from institution to ordinary housing, Elizabeth and Helen are still learning about community living and adjusting to its demands and possibilities. The women's days are beginning to include the mix of activities, experiences and relationships which make up ordinary life for most people. Their daily routines are starting to reflect their preferences and abilities and to include a level of personal responsibility. As well as having to adapt to major changes in their status, environment, lifestyle and relationships, Elizabeth and Helen have to cope with the adjustments made by the people on whom they depend. Health service staff and managers are still developing the new skills and the framework necessary to offer a quality community care service. Neighbours and business people, many of whom are confronting disability for the first time, have yet to work out ways of behaving with respect towards them and ways of making links which are welcome and helpful. The women's long separation from the mainstream means that increasing their participation in ordinary life is an inevitable learning process for everybody involved. The realisation that the transition from exclusion to inclusion is a slow manoeuvre and that community care evolves rather than happens became clear soon after Elizabeth and Helen arrived at their new home. The first few months of life in the community were dominated by support workers' sense of heavy responsibility about the twin tasks of meeting the women's physical and medical needs and, at the same time, enabling them to be as independent as possible. One member of the staff team of nine had nursing training; two had been teachers and the rest were from a variety of other backgrounds. The balance between doing too much and doing too little for Elizabeth and Helen, who both use wheelchairs, had to be continuously readjusted. Staff received basic instructions, but the appropriate ways to help each woman with personal care, diet and medication (for epilepsy) had to be worked out through discussion with the helpers. From the beginning of her tenancy Helen took pride in having a home of her own. She coped well with the change-over and immediately welcomed any opportunity to take part in household activities. \\u2018It's my job\\u2019, is her prompt response to any attempt to take over tasks she wants to do herself. Helen's ability to enjoy herself and express her objections effectively make her an easy person to help, although she is sometimes criticised for being demanding. Elizabeth found the move to community living much more difficult. On many occasions during those first few months, she was moody, tearful and uncommunicative. At the worst times she refused to leave her armchair in the lounge all day and occasionally overnight, saying she was too frightened to go to bed or to the bathroom. She cut herself off from comfort by clenching her fists, screaming and occasionally kicking when people approached. She was also frightened of doing housework and passed on jobs to a support worker, announcing: \\u2018She can do it.\\u2019 professional advice about Elizabeth's unhappiness  was that she was in a state of \\u2018mourning\\u2019 and that time would improve matters. In those early stages, support workers, who were highly motivated to give Elizabeth and Helen a \\u2018better life\\u2019, felt that the demands of the women's physical needs, together with Elizabeth's state of mind, undermined hopes for their social progress. The basic business of looking after them felt so demanding and emotionally wearing that there seemed little rime left to introduce them to \\u2018real living\\u2019. WIDENING HORIZONS Looking back, there's no doubt that we were too impatient and were unprepared for the major impact of the change from institution to community care on all concerned. As the third anniversary of the women's arrival in the community approaches, there is a marked improvement in Elizabeth's sense of well-being and greater participation by both women in activities beyond domestic and care routines. The women may spend large parts of the day on personal care, preparing and clearing up after meals and doing their laundry. They have to overcome difficulties to accomplish these tasks so the amount of time involved increases the more the women participate and the less support workers take over. Although lengthy domestic and care routines are to some extent a reality of disability, it is necessary to work out a level of sharing between the women and their staff which allows a varied day and does not make a drudge out of anybody. A typical day for Elizabeth and Helen includes the usual range of personal and domestic tasks involved in looking after themselves and their flat with support, together with popular leisure activities such as watching television and listening to music. Helen may do some painting and Elizabeth likes to work at drawing shapes and picking out words as first steps in reading and writing. Some form of keep fit exercises or dancing in the flat is a feature on most days as are trips out to pursue activities in connection with their developing social programme. Such social activities as going to adult education classes, taking trips out in their car, going to church, visiting friends and being visited, now happen on a more regular basis. Around the time I was compiling this report the women attended three adult education classes a week \\u2014 for music, keep-fit and self-advocacy. They had recently been on separate holidays, met support workers' families at their homes, danced at a party and had their photographs taken cuddling the few weeks' old daughter of a woman Elizabeth met at church. A trip to London was planned and they were expecting two visits \\u2014 one from an elderly relative who'd been in touch after receiving a holiday postcard and another from two people who used to live in the flat upstairs and had telephoned asking if they could call by. Elizabeth compiled the following list, with support, of what she likes about living in her own home. Because of Helen. Going out. Likes seeing Linda. Likes the workers. Because of my car. Going to church. Having visitors. Having a fish tank. Elizabeth was also asked if she would like to make a list of what she does not like about community living but could not think of anything for the moment. She says that in the future, in addition to her current activities, she wants to learn to read and write and to plant flowers in the garden. She does not want to do housework. Helen is not interested in making lists about her life, preferring to talk about the more immediate experiences of her recent holiday and birthday. Her speech is not easy to understand but she effectively communicates her complete approval and enjoyment of the busy week when she went away. She'd been \\u2018everywhere\\u2019, she says, raising her arms and pointing in many different directions. She is an outgoing, cheerful person with an ability to communicate her feelings, to get along, and find enjoyment in most situations. She often opens conversations by telling people brightly: \\u2018I got up this morning\\u2019, which seems to reflect her talent for being delighted by what is deeply ordinary. Helen's main problems since she moved into her own home have been a period of illness, which caused her much discomfort, and a spate of difficulties in accepting personal care from temporary staff. Helen's personality does not seem to have altered significantly since her move into the community, although she has become more tolerant. In general, she has simply become more herself; opportunities to participate have increased and she has responded to most of them enthusiastically. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has changed significantly. For a start she looks different. She is slimmer and looks more of a woman, in clothes which are appropriate for her age. She slouches less in her wheelchair, raises her head more and looks at people in a more direct manner. She says she does not like housework but she can manage some tasks. She can count out and administer her own drugs and explain her own needs during visits to the doctor. She is exceptionally good company when she is happy. She is curious and asks many questions about people and situations around her, including her own disabilities and difficulties. She works hard to understand issues which confuse her and is learning to be patient with herself when, as she puts it, her brain \\u2018gets stuck\\u2019. She expresses much appreciation for what she considers beautiful and is beginning to show and receive affection. How to tell when a person has become a friend is the latest of many difficult questions to which Elizabeth struggles to find answers. Elizabeth is learning to speak up for herself. She says \\u2018no\\u2019 more often, rather than suffering or withdrawing, and she is able to remind people of her difficulty in concentrating on more than one thing at a time. I received a straightforward message recently when I telephoned her flat for a chat: \\u2018Elizabeth says she's busy.\\u2019 She is sorting out the conundrum of being a \\u2018high grade\\u2019 in hospital and a \\u2018person with a disability\\u2019in the community. At times it surely is very difficult for her. She still has periods of withdrawal and sadness but they are decreasing. A SHAKY SUPPORT NETWORK Community care for Elizabeth and Helen involves an extraordinary network of services which has yet to operate to full capacity and efficiency. Elizabeth and Helen have made progress despite the weakness and unpredictability of this shaky, official safety net. It is a constant concern that they might have achieved much more if services had been better and that they may regress if services don't improve. The women's direct support comes from a staff team working in twos at their flat during the day with one person sleeping overnight. Behind this front line is a complicated structure of health, social, housing and financial services, management and monitoring systems. During the first years of the women's life in the community, the full-time team of health authority support workers has been regularly understaffed, with temporary cover being provided by a private nursing agency. None of the original team who were with the women at the time of the move still work at their flat. I left the team because the low pay would not cover the cost of my share in a mortgage to buy my own flat, and because I found it difficult to reconcile the separate roles of paid worker and friend, when Helen and Elizabeth recognised no such distinction. I was sad to leave but felt that a turnover of paid staff was unavoidable with the present pay and conditions. I reassured myself that nothing could stop me keeping in touch with the women on a voluntary basis, provided they wished to remain friends. The period during which I have been writing this chapter has seen one of the worst staffing levels ever at the women's flat. At one stage half the permanent health service posts were unfilled and agency staff worked in the flat on a daily basis. The consortium responsible for looking after the women's housing and financial affairs, as well as providing some monitoring of the quality of service, had temporarily to reduce its operations because of staff shortages. Members of the health authority team set up to give advice on the \\u2018physical, psychological, communication and mental health needs\\u2019 of people with learning difficulties are often difficult to contact when support workers want to discuss problems relating to the women. It is only recently that Elizabeth and Helen have had the benefit of a full-time manager whose job is to provide support, supervision and leadership to staff working in their home. The effective operation of an Individual programme plan (IPP) for each woman is a major casualty of the haphazard delivery of services. The IPP is a system for mapping out individual goals, specifying means of achievement and assigning responsibility for progress. It is the most reliable method available for trying to ensure that the principles of community care policy agreed by the health authority \\u2014 community presence, community participation, competence, respect and choice \\u2014 are actually made available to the users of a service. The system aims to involve service users, and their friends and relatives, in planning individual lifestyles in the community, working out strategy and reviewing progress. The written document produced in the process belongs to service users and provides them with necessary information to challenge service providers if they don't fulfil their contributions to the plan. The Individual Programme Plans of Elizabeth and Helen, which took two attempts to get off the ground because of staff changes and inadequate training, have been virtually suspended \\u2014 even before the first reviews \\u2014 because of the latest staffing upheaval. Support staff who remain with the women worry increasingly about the lack of continuity. They are concerned that agency staff and new staff who don't know what the women have achieved will undermine progress, or even reverse it, by underestimating their capabilities. The lack of fully operational IPPs, which could have provided a safeguard against inconsistency, adds to workers' anxiety that Elizabeth and Helen are being let down. While the community care service sorts out its shortfalls, Elizabeth's enthusiasm to learn to read and write could be overtaken by boredom and depression. Helen's frustration with people who don't appreciate her could result in a marked reduction in her tolerance level. According to one worker there had already been an occasion when she found Helen being \\u2018fed, wiped and pushed round the house\\u2019. Support workers also worry about the effect of setbacks on the generally negative attitudes of many people in the community to people with learning difficulties. \\u2018It's a vicious circle\\u2019, explained one worker. \\u2018people with learning difficulties are not respected to begin with and because the women's Individual Programmes, including skills training, are not in place, they are not progressing as well as they could and they are not getting respect.\\u2019 A senior manager agreed that because of staff shortages in the flat, planning and development for the women had taken second place to \\u2018keeping people afloat\\u2019. When new staff were appointed development could move ahead again. Regarding community care in general in the authority the manager insisted, \\u2018We haven't got there yet, but we are certainly going in the right direction.\\u2019 Elizabeth and Helen express rather similar sentiments about their new way of life. \\u2018It's all right\\u2019, \\u2018I feel all right \\u2019, they say. \\u2018I'm happy\\u2019, \\u2018I'm settled\\u2019, \\u2018Now I know what it feels like\\u2019, \\u2018I got out on the right side\\u2019. They have not expressed any wish to return to living in an institution full time, although Helen occasionally likes to visit the hospital where she was a resident immediately before the move into the community. And while support staff are adamant about the need for  improvements in services and organisation, nobody believes the women would be better off returning to institutional care. CONCLUSION Elizabeth and Helen's initial experience of life in the community has brought them unhappiness and difficulties. There has also been much learning, laughter and warmth which has extended the enjoyment and understanding of everybody involved. The new community care service has enabled the women to claim their places as citizens in their neighbourhood and take a tentative hold of a share in the goodness of ordinary life. Opportunities have become available to them which would have been impossible in hospital. From the women's point of view, the need in the future is for a more reliable and responsive support network and a wider circle of friends and acquaintances to help them strengthen their hold on, and increase their share of, life in the community. THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by \\u2018professionals\\u2019: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but \\u2018what is it to be human?\\u2019 sounds like a philosophical question \\u2014 in which case it is also a political one \\u2014 rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as \\u2018comprehensive\\u2019. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule \\u2014 that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister \\u2014 does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, \\u2018Nothing human is alien to me\\u2019, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining \\u2018human\\u2019 group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what \\u2018humanity\\u2019 consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are \\u2018excluders\\u2019 and \\u2018includers\\u2019. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics \\u2014 that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. \\u2018parents\\u2019 are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a \\u2018natural expert\\u2019, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, \\u2018When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is \\u2014 you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .\\u2019 Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include \\u2018their\\u2019 children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be \\u2018philosophical\\u2019 in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just \\u2018this is how we live\\u2019, but \\u2018this is how one ought to live\\u2019. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are \\u2018physically alive but socially dead\\u2019: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use \\u2018massa's\\u2019 language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the \\u2018civilisation\\u2019, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (\\u2018What is it to be Black?\\u2019, \\u2018What is it to be a woman?\\u2019), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, \\u2018What is it to be human?\\u2019 WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, \\u2018discourses\\u2019, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include \\u2018expert\\u2019 ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a \\u2018Down's baby\\u2019 before the birth \\u2014 in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception \\u2014 they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION \\u2018When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do \\u2014 she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]\\u2026 I had an instant bond with Marie \\u2014 I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born \\u2014 I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor \\u2014 I've known him since I was a baby \\u2014 and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, \\u2018Is your husband Chinese?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018No.\\u2019 And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, \\u2018Well, I think the baby's a mongol\\u2019, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know\\u2026and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say \\u2018Here, is this baby a mongol?\\u2019 in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, \\u2018We've got some news.\\u2019 And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, \\u2018Does she look like anybody in your family?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.\\u2019 She said, \\u2018Oh \\u2014 you a nurse?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018No, I can just tell by her face\\u2019\\u2026 So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning\\u2026 Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her\\u2026 The exact feelings\\u2026 I wanted her to die\\u2026 And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. \\u2018Natural\\u2019: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word \\u2018natural\\u2019 is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of \\u2018hysteria\\u2019and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then \\u2018Once I'd touched her, she was mine.\\u2019 She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows \\u2014 unlike the professionals \\u2014 exactly what the \\u2018shock\\u2019 is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought\\u2026 I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them\\u2026but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people\\u2026 They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times\\u2026but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that \\u2018It's natural to feel shocked\\u2019, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair\\u2026\\u2019). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of \\u2018shock\\u2019 have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life \\u2014 partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. \\u2018Shock\\u2019 and \\u2018trauma\\u2019must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract \\u2018thing\\u2019which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience \\u2014 becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human \\u2014 seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. \\u2018COMING TO TERMS\\u2019: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby\\u2026 These feelings\\u2026may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that \\u2018the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had\\u2019(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?\\u2026 Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of \\u2018coping\\u2019 and \\u2018coming to terms\\u2019describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said \\u2018Typical mongol\\u2019, either \\u2018Typical mongol features\\u2019 or \\u2018Typical mongol face\\u2019, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him\\u2026 They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: \\u2018That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.\\u2019 That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby\\u2026 I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things \\u2018fall into place\\u2019. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round \\u2014 she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner \\u2014 and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him \\u2014 virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: \\u2018Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it\\u2019(\\u2018it\\u2019 being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is \\u2018for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to \\u2018come to terms with\\u2019 a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you \\u2018come to terms\\u2019 with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology \\u2014 a \\u2018monster\\u2019, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they \\u2018needed to know\\u2019, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about \\u2018having another one\\u2019, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it \\u2018normally\\u2019 and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing \\u2014 let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people \\u2014 why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, \\u2018normality\\u2019 itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS \\u2018I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome\\u2019(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like\\u2026\\u2019 cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their\\u2026but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people\\u2026 He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, \\u2018What's the kids going to be when they grow up?\\u2019 I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know\\u2026 My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses\\u2026 Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake\\u2026 Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker\\u2026 I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed \\u2018fortunate\\u2019 to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs \\u00a3500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as \\u2018sad, bad news\\u2019 to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the \\u2018bereavement response\\u2019 to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)\\u2018Shock\\u2019,(2)\\u2018panic\\u2019,(3)\\u2018Denial\\u2019,(4)\\u2018Grief\\u2019,(5)\\u2018Guilt\\u2019,(6)\\u2018Anger\\u2019(in general),(7)\\u2018Anger Against professionals\\u2019,(8)\\u2018Bargaining\\u2019and finally (9)\\u2018Acceptance\\u2019. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not \\u2018professionals\\u2019 and \\u2018parents\\u2019. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the \\u2018real people\\u2019. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and \\u2014 make no mistake \\u2014 will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an \\u2018equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having \\u2018moderate learning difficulties\\u2019. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer \\u2018smaller classes and more individual attention\\u2019. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words \\u2014canal, lock, barge \\u2014 but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 and \\u2018sponge-bag\\u2019. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a \\u2018night-dress\\u2019 for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent \\u2014 teacher association, visit the \\u2018Spring Fayre\\u2019, to volunteer for \\u2018parent-governor elections\\u2019, or attend a \\u2018Maths Workshop\\u2019 were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like \\u2018his development of spatial awareness, or \\u2018his confidence on the apparatus\\u2019. However phrases like \\u2018is working hard\\u2019, \\u2018always tries his best\\u2019, \\u2018is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like \\u2018He is well below average\\u2019, \\u2018He is slow\\u2019, \\u2018He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.\\u2019 Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the \\u2018pirate series\\u2019 by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by \\u2018a highly intelligent girl\\u2019. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not \\u2018the bottom of the bottom set\\u2019. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, \\u2018I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.\\u2019 Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, \\u2018Nice is in every child.\\u2019 The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, \\u2018after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class\\u2019. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that \\u2018whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both\\u2019. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children \\u2018with learning difficulties\\u2019) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying \\u2018He always wants to play\\u2026he just wants toys.\\u2019 When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested \\u2014 she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called \\u2018social concerns\\u2019 behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, \\u2018He reverts when he is with naughty children.\\u2019 They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been \\u2018feeling awful\\u2019 all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly \\u00a3400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision \\u2014 once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word \\u2018special\\u2019; and phrases like \\u2018learning difficulties\\u2019, \\u2018becomes anxious\\u2019, \\u2018experienced\\u2019 are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, \\u2018These children, do they learn it at the end?\\u2019 The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, \\u2018I want my child to leave\\u2019, and he said, \\u2018Our job is to help the child go back.\\u2019 They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, \\u2018They have learnt, that's nice.\\u2019 The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be \\u2018mature\\u2019 enough to cope with a \\u2018look and say\\u2019approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how \\u2018look and say\\u2019 uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school \\u2014 lower/ middle/upper \\u2014 resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: \\u2018Together, we can achieve more.\\u2019 The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, \\u2018We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.\\u2019 Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: \\u2018He will not come until you sign it\\u2026in the end you decide.\\u2019 Mr Singh asked his first question: \\u2018Would it be next September?\\u2019 The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away \\u2018at any time\\u2019. Mrs Singh asked \\u2018Do you have the same holiday?\\u2019 and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, \\u2018I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still\\u2026he wants toys\\u2026he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do\\u2026\\u2019 The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, \\u2018I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.\\u2019 The head said it was important to think about \\u2018whatever is best\\u2019 for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for \\u2014\\u2018people think it's for mentally handicapped\\u2019. \\u2018It doesn't look like one\\u2019, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is \\u2018a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills\\u2019. Its job is to help children \\u2018who are struggling\\u2019. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy \\u2014 they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, \\u2018class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.\\u2019 Terms like, \\u2018environmental work\\u2019, \\u2018a full curriculum\\u2019, \\u2018special programmes of work for language development\\u2019 would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that \\u2018parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.\\u2019 Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain \\u2014 she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: \\u2018If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child\\u2026your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.\\u2019 An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: \\u2018parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.\\u2019 Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, \\u2018who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate\\u2026\\u2019 All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, \\u2018the majority remain until they are 16 years of age\\u2019. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any \\u2018work\\u2019. I was not sure what she meant by \\u2018work\\u2019. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems \\u2014 speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty \\u2018sounding\\u2019 because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, \\u2018You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?\\u2019 The head said, \\u2018No, he's not ill.\\u2019 Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said \\u2018Yes, he does have difficulty remembering \\u2014 particularly sounding\\u2019, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be \\u2018wild\\u2019, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, \\u2018That's our view of Balbinder.\\u2019 The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in \\u2018boys swimming\\u2019, \\u2018wet play\\u2019. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed \\u2014 he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, \\u2018They are not allowed to speak English at home.\\u2019 She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say \\u2018can I\\u2019, or \\u2018May I\\u2019 instead of\\u2018I want to\\u2019. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be \\u2018ill\\u2019. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much \\u2018talk and show\\u2019 early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, \\u2018I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.\\u2019 On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was \\u2018pretty borderline for special school\\u2019. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or \\u2018academic\\u2019 language. She reported on his \\u2018good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that \\u2018he now speaks both languages all right\\u2019. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: \\u2018I can't rely on myself \\u2014 I don't know \\u2014 working all the time \\u2014 how could I know.\\u2019 Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional \\u2014 parent and professional \\u2014 child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional \\u2014 parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional \\u2014 parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of \\u2018the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor \\u2018causing\\u2019 the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the \\u2018fact\\u2019 that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. \\u2018Mum was initially cooperative\\u2026and Mr Peel was likewise \\u2018quite cooperative\\u2019\\u2019 until the decision was made to Statement\\u2026after that he opted out and didn't contact me.\\u2019 Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, \\u2018She seemed to be assessing me rather than John\\u2026it's like she's shifting the blame on to me\\u2026she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.\\u2019 The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: \\u2018She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.\\u2019 In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: \\u2018On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.\\u2019 She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the \\u2018dynamics\\u2019 of this family and to advise them that \\u2018as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting \\u2014 the health visitor, the doctor, teachers \\u2014 but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home\\u2026it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to \\u2018intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role\\u2019. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the \\u2018needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that \\u2018We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.\\u2019 For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that \\u2018John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.\\u2019 On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. \\u2018The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.\\u2019 Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions \\u2018don't ring true with my  own experience\\u2019. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is \\u2018a load of rubbish. It's a legal document\\u2026but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.\\u2019 However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher \\u2018It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.\\u2019 George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an \\u2018urgent case\\u2019. His teachers reported that the problem was \\u2018behaviour in class and at home\\u2019. In school, George was described as \\u2018aggressive\\u2026he wanders about instead of getting on with his work\\u2026he won't conform\\u2026he's like his brother\\u2026generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.\\u2019 Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was \\u2018brought in\\u2019 in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: \\u2018I don't think he's any worse than other kids \\u2014 he's picked on by the school.\\u2019 Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling \\u2014 he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help \\u2014 I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: \\u2018I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.\\u2019 When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says \\u2018You've sent me away and don't love me.\\u2019 Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. \\u2018We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.\\u2019 The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because \\u2018I haven't been told.\\u2019 The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding \\u2014 if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this \\u2018fact\\u2019 was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. \\u2018They see residential school as an alternative to \\u2018care\\u2019 but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.\\u2019 The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision \\u2018they really want to make \\u2019. EP : What I suggest we do \\u2014 nothing's going to be decided today \\u2014 I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools \\u2014 at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon \\u2018professional judgement\\u2019. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby \\u2018a more stable home situation\\u2019 was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the \\u2018named person\\u2019. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: \\u2018We didn't ask for it [the assessment]\\u2014 it was the education system who said it should be done \\u2014 if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.\\u2019 Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: \\u2018It introduces so much trauma \\u2014 you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.\\u2019 Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. \\u2018It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.\\u2019 Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive \\u2018because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope\\u2019. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was \\u2018No way am I going to agree with that.\\u2019 On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her \\u2018rights\\u2019 under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a \\u2018chance to fail\\u2019. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. \\u2018It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities\\u2019(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of \\u2018disclosure\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of \\u2018partnership\\u2019 and \\u2018involvement\\u2019. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned \\u2018with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals\\u2019(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of \\u2018need\\u2019 is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of \\u2018special educational need\\u2019. \\u2018Need\\u2019 was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the \\u2018rights\\u2019 parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

That one's quite hot I think. That's erm  something or other. Or just put it onto your  poppadom like that. Easier to put it straight on. Mm. So we , with your pensions and things  is mum, what about mum does she know  what about the state pension and stuff? Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you  Oh. get it on one. Because she hasn't worked, nothing? Mm. Well, so  and th , and the husband So married woman's like if their  husband left them  and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered? Or are they not? I don't know. I don't know, it's, it's er  it's a little harder to say the least. Is, if they we , if he's left  I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing. Oh right. But  it's not so much nowadays though. You have a  the problem   if the husband remarries. Yeah. Er, er, you know, who gets the I suppose it's pretty difficult really. No you can't. Sorry. Erm, with mum  i i i is fine because she could   from my point of view so, and also  as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank  she gets  Oh! a widow's pension from the bank  Oh right. so that she doesn't  so we get nothing for Oh right. It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really? Oh  yeah. And of course even that's going to change as time goes on. Really? So what happens like, with me? Like teaching? Do I need to do  I, they don't do anything  Well you may have , you may have to look after yourself in fact. Yeah. Cos obviously  it's different for you. That's the thing. Erm  er  it will be see if you can  pay into something Mm. er soon after you start your job. Yeah. I'll think about it  So, say as , say erm, say by the time you're  you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty. Yeah, cos I'll be working  well I'm twenty one. I'm doing a third year  I'll be twenty four Mm. when I qualify. Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really. Well you can start off with you see, a small sum  as regards an insurance policy. Yeah. Then take the twenty five or thirty years. Is that what you've done? That's how you're paying? No. The two, the two insurance policies I had  of erm  er the house  were on  Oh right. and when we moved  I think we had a new insurance policy to cover    and the  others became mine. Oh right. That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my  early matured pay from Roberts  and the other one in fact  matures next year with everything attached to it  except for one  Oh right. of you, for you. Yeah. And the lump sum I can  then  could put in mum's name  to avoid. Yeah. paying tax on the interest. Oh right. And then just utilize a little each year. Yeah. Oh right. We should get help with James though shouldn't we? Well  at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for  Oh. James so, if there is something, all well and good. Oh yeah. I don't see how they can justify  I mean, anybody, unless you'd  got mega bucks Mm. you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly  in one goes' a big,bi , like quite a shock. And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever  but paying it out in one go or Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm  what  so he's gonna get sacked. Gone into erm  money . And that way, any interest on erm  it becomes tax free. Yeah. Oh! So again, I have to be careful because  real interest is gained on  this money that's in  grand mama's  name. Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er  Nigel's. Yeah. There's not that much there though is there? There's enough. Really? Yeah, it's erm Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn? Yes. It was very pleasant. The  the journey up there was erm  Mum said , your mum's going a bit mental? Oh, probably is. To put it politely. I expect she is. Does she see your brother much? She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round. Really? Mm. Oh good. Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy  she's er  that she's comfortable Yeah. er i in her place. It's been wonderful! Mum said it's really nice. Mm. What is it? It's not  is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for? Along , along th that sort of line. Erm  you have a war , warden who lives on, the premises  you have contact with the wardens  and if there's any problems you can  Yeah. pull a cord  and they erm use a  It's a bit like the one we we , went to see Aunty Mary's when we to  Oh that's true. tidy it up. And this is really what So is it, is it private or  or erm  Well it's her trust. Oh. It's her trust. So she pays? She pays a certain amount, but erm  you get erm  Subsidised. That's right. Yeah. This is really what Ma-in-law should have done. Yeah. About the same sort of thing. Oh yeah. Well, just to sit there  it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up. Sorry? Mum's fed up. Oh yeah. She was telling me the other day. But it's just  But erm  I dunno, it's just so awful! Well It just turned everything so sour. Mm. But it probably was, I mean  probably deep down  if we didn't see her  , probably got on quite well with her. But you, you just see to much of her that now Yeah. that it's just got no  got no wanting to talk to her or  Mm! or no , you know, anything. Well no, you see Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything. I don't know. But the problem  I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you  we found  that  she'd, she just kept on telling us off. And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't  and, there was no thought at all toward  No. the children. Yeah. And as I say, there was always one I remember  that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December  five weekends on the trot! Yeah. Mm mm. I was going mental! Well that's it. So what did she say to you? Nothing. Well, I do , I hope  but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but  you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but  but when you have a position where you have  five Yeah. people in the house It's very stressful. I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms  there  Yeah. isn't a space there. Well not if it's not designed for it. I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with  a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa , I, I  I, there's too many here. Mm. And course it's reached the point of no return now where she  she can't do anything for herself. Well there's nothing , yeah. You just can't do it. But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us  Mm mm. between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve  Well it's  and herself. Yes. Which is such a shame because  like, we all,wi , we all get on really well with William. Sure. You know, like more, more brother,si  Yeah. brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else. But, you know, you don't wanna keep  her off. Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get  you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff. But there is an underlined current there  Mm. which is erm, Mum is aware of. Oh definitely. But  you know  the situation is  it's like  Mum should not  expect  just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co  Yeah. and, and settle down in Brentwood. I'm, I, I'm sorry. It's happened too many times now that she's  You can  really just, you can't break it. You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her  hold on  that  that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her  Yeah. and will continue to, to, to, erm  so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her. Very, very difficult. Well  that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way  would we  get ourselves in that position for you  you have your lives to lead Yeah. get on with it. There's no point ruining  a good relationship by  That's right. Yeah. things like that. Just turns everything sour. So how was your weekend  Ah. in  Sheffield? Did you go wa , get around to see much at all? Erm, not much. What did we do? The Friday  we finally got there at about  the traffic was so bad  because Friday night as well. You'd gone up in, oh yes. Erm Do you want a bit more? No, I've had, I've had erm  two already. Erm  we went out Go on. Can't remember. Can't remember what I want now. Right erm  could I have the  er the mild korma down here please? chicken korma. Yep. Okay. And the king prawn korma. And the king prawn korma. Do you want another ? Not for me thanks, no. Erm  what do you want the, the the  paratha  Pi , pilau, yeah. One of those do you? Just one of the  paratha  Yeah, just one. And, we wanted? One pilau and one mushroom One pilau and one mushroom and one mushroom rice. One pilau rice and one mushroom. And one mushroom rice. Yes thank you. Do you want any nan bread? Do you want any nan bread? No, I'm fine thank you. No, thanks a lot. Right. Thank you. Okay? One chicken korma, one prawn korma, the er pilau rice, mushroom rice and a  paratha  That's it. Lovely. Thank you very much. Lovely , thank you. Yeah so, Friday night  we went out with her friend Helen and another friend where she works, and this other guy. It was really good actually. We went into Sheffield  right into the city  and went to a pub. It was pouring down with rain though. So heavy! We got so soaked. We couldn't find a taxi so we thought well  we may as well start walking. Yippee! Oh there is it? Oh! What's happened now? Looks a bit dead to me. ! I had a little chat with an old man today about his flowers. So he smiled at me. Yeah, so he was cutting his like flowers off, so I said oh they're really nice. He was telling me that they'd died of the frost or something. But he gave me a good smile and a big goodbye when I left him so. Oh I see. Where was this, down Lincoln Avenue? Jus , just there  Gloucester Road, I was just coming back from Witham. It's the roads  you know where our house is? Just  Yeah. the road sort of, sort of here. Oh! I see. Yeah. That's where it was. Only takes about  takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station  to get like to London and Kingston and  e all your other sort  Oh I see! of stuff. Just sort of up that way. Oh yes. So that's good  So it's quite good  isn't it? So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about  twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away. So it's easier to go to Witham. You have to change  Mm. at Twickenham though, that's not too  Oh oh. bad. But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car. Oh. That's alright. And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well . Vicky . So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham. Oh yeah. So I must go and see her. I was thinking maybe next weekend I might  or meet her for the day  Yes, you must. or something. Yeah! Well you'll have to go down there. And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well. And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton. So we're all sort of in the same, very  Yes, oh yes you must  close vicinity  well  so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something. We said  Yeah. when we're all settled in. So I must give her a ring this week actually. I didn't realize how close we were. I'm so, I've  No. got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue. You should, you should ge , if you look on a map you can, you can judge where  I know you can, but really I can't  I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map. Yeah. Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map  and we're all sort of cut off. Well then  Yeah. I haven't got a clue where I'm going. No. As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue. I never used one before  until I came here . Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a  Honestly I  train for I really haven't got a clue. a form of transport. So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going. Yeah. Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet? Yeah , but I'm hopeless ! Mm mm. I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew  where I was going and  everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me. I'm, they must think I'm so thick ! I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before  I know I can get off the bus . And that's the way it goes . Oh right. Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it. Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are. It's just such a worry though. Well no, no. No, no. Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag. I just tell everyone I'm new in the area. So I just say I'm really new in the area . So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area. The thing is do , I don't think I'd know. I wouldn't know how to get a bus . I wouldn't have a clue where to go. Oh no, I'd, I'd , I probably wouldn't either but er  er, the thing is, it's the he e , having to live here for  well say, at least three  Yeah. years  it's really matter of getting hold of a map  Oh yeah. a a and using it. I'm working my way  slowly but surely Ye you should  sh how to get around. How we doing for time? Mm. Not bad. It's always busy. It's twenty five to ten. Ho oh! My God! Mm mm. Oh! It smells so nice. Well  , okay. You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better. What's happening for James' birthday? I don't know at the moment. I haven't even thought about it. At least he doesn't want a party. You're safe  No, oh  with that one. Well the thing is, er, I, I can It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way. I, I think he's  drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family. I think he realizes that er  there's a heap lot of trouble out there  Yeah. er er  he could become involved  Yeah. with if he just let go Yeah. Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously  at that age it's very impressionable and very like  they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out Yes. drinking or whatever, and causing trouble. The thing is that , really, that they all they've done is show themselves up. Cos  Mm. I, I was surprised when I heard of  sort of the things that had happened. Yeah. I'm sorry, but, you know, they're  I'm impressed with the warnings. For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though. Yeah sure. Sure. I think that's re , cos that's  He  the only way Yeah. cos the majority  Yes, you're right. haven't got a clue  Yeah. No. what anybody does. Yeah I know. Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that  I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they  Silly. are. Even in somebody else's house you  Yeah. just show respect. Oh, yes. I mean, no matter what you're doing yo , or where you are you just show respect for other  Yeah. people's property or  And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they? Mm. I hope the master  I think the teachers are gonna have to be there. Well, they'll be I think they're gonna have a tough time. Thank you. Thank you. Chicken  and prawn. Thank you. korma. Have two more Cokes I should think. Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke? Yeah. Right. Can I have a  another two Diet Cokes please? Thank you. I think the teachers  co , but I think the teachers realize what they are like. I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them. Well, Well they would be o , they're representing too many people for them to misbehave. Well I ,. I, I hope, in fact, that i , if one does th  It's no ignoring it yeah, well the  till it  thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back  Yeah. to the U K.  But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble  Mm. would stop. I think you Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi , there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot. No, well  but er  it, it, it's  it just strikes me as being  a very, very immature when you're in another person's house Yeah. Lovely thanks. Thanks. Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically. Yeah. It's sick! You can turn them off . Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding. Oh yes. I think I'll have those in the bedroom window. Did you put my red light up yet? I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I   as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends . And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like  I'm sorry, what's going on? Yes. That's it. Come on mate, I'm starving! No, no  advances on his, on his salary soon. It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels? Like und , that was underneath? D'ya remember that res , you know when we went to Brussels  and stayed above the  sort of Indian restaurant? Oh yes! Yes I do. Thanks very much. Yes that was a little bit out. But, ah yes, I remember. Yes. Yeah. Cor! You have a long memory. Certainly have. It's there somewhere. Do you remember it? Yes. That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually. Well yes, a couple of years ago. It was when James went to  Russia. Oh! That was it. Er near, near er  Skiptia  Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there. near  Skiptov  Oh that was it. Robert was in, at, at, University. Yeah. Oh that was it. She must have been away so we took flight. Yeah. That was good actually. It was quite nice. Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels. My goodness me! Was a bit of a mare wasn't it? Ah! It was terrible. Because the thing had changed so ma , so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me. Yeah. And secondly, as regards where they were  the road maps didn't seem that  didn't coordinate that  Yeah. well. Has he got a job? I do , I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er  with the bank. Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you  you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back  Mm. on the damn thing again. Well I can't even find the M twenty five ! No. I was surprised it to ,we well going  to this place yesterday  er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty  Yeah. five on the M four, the M four we look for  er er  exit eight  is it eight? Yes it is. After that, we started in trouble. We went into  the village of  that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al , along the road, erm  you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo , to, to, to Bray. Oh yeah? Bang! We were on the motorway where's this bloody sign!     So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up  so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was. Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway. But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come okay You have to lose your way, come back, yeah. That's it. So we  we, we turned down this road, through the village  and we couldn't find Monkey Island. Oh! Oh ! Oh alright. Fair enough. So we stopped again. I went across and  yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left. So, up we go  the road narrows  straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all. Mm. I said, what the bloody hell's happening here? So went in the car park, turned  back  took the first er er, er  well I did a right then Yeah. there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island. But  you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great. Well it would be, yeah. Ah! Really great! And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er  I'm not surprised. Terrible! Terrible! So what is it, a, an actual island? It's an actual island, yes, and you see  And how bi , quite big, it must be quite big. Is it big? It's not that large, but it's,yo yo get a  You just take it over for the  weekend? Well, we, we, we,mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island  Yeah. the  th , the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath. It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too  Oh I see. because of the water. But this was a boat was saw s , over the  up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er  whether it had been tied up too tight in fact  I wo , now, now for leeway  and the thing had  just sunk. Oh. Oh blimey! Yeah th , the water level's just  Really? just a, you know, way up above the  the main er thing, yeah. But, there's the  the main, er, hotel  that you book into and you come away from there  to the dining area and erm  and the reception   Oh I see. Oh quite pleasant. Must cost them a fortune. Mm mm. D'ya get everything paid for? Everything paid for. Well  I gather everything's paid for, all, all the all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all. Erm Did they like your phone bill from erm Oh crikey! They won't be paying for that. Where was it? Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland. That's it. I couldn't think where you'd been to . Oh. No,i , it should be that. The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink  I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction  It's not worth it  just for one week is it? and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six  I did some  Why d'ya get up so early? You know just to  well ease myself in really. I, I, I woke up at half past six, I got a call Mental man! er, no not really. Really ju , just, it just, I, I got everything ready, I was out. I had breakfast at seven  sent up, up to the room, ah and then just  watched the, I, oh yeah, watched a bit of television news, put some music on the  television. Cos you can put the channel just to show the time  and  Oh right. and one or two others. Oh that's right. Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er  twenty to nine. Oh! I was one of the lucky ones because they were  having done that  the others in fact left it until later  and in fact they took, they, they called up for time. Ah oh. You know. You're not as dumb as you look are you? No , no. Well the thing is, I got caught once before in the other place when I went to  Manor of the Groves  where I tried to book out  erm  and found I was late for the first erm ,. first erm  meeting. Give your apologies as you walk in   Well yes , and I thought well, you know, okay, I did it because I was wondering if  You know these, these , V P's V P's, yeah. sits down and says . So this time I was determined not to erm, get caught. And it's paid off. It was a, a nice place. Nice and sunny. Ba , I had  Yeah. lunch, we, we had a, er er, from half past twelve through till  till quarter to two  erm  and then went back inside. But you, you sat outside for the best part of  quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, cos it was so sunny. And it was a  When the weather's nice it's just lovely, really nice  Oh it's beautiful! Yes. It's just  and it's so, it's like it was raining the other day when we went to go out  and just could not be bothered. It was really  Mm. pelting down. Oh it was when we were gonna go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no, I really cannot be bothered, it's just pouring down with rain, had to  Yeah. get the bus and I thought, oh er  so luckily Lisa sa , like they said, oh don't be silly we'll come and get you. So luckily, they like drove round and picked me up  Oh I see. and just brought me back again, which is fine. Right. But , just when you've got no transport and it's  Mm mm. pouring down with rain it's  it's just such an effort  to motivate yourself to get up to  Oh God! Yeah. It's like when we had no wa , like heating  or water, it was such an effort to  get yourself up  Yeah. to get ready to go out and the  Yeah. just, cold showers and stuff are like Oh bloody hell! not on my list of like  pleasurable er  No. things to do. Just like, no way! No I  I mean,we , I say, we sat out there and the peacocks are there  peahens. Oh yeah! Oh really? Mm mm. I see. I say, it i , it's nice, I mean, unless you  you really know about it  you have no idea at all. No. No idea. I suppose a lot of business might be done through word of mouth as well. Mm mm. If anything. The kind of thing you ought to do with  with mum is like, you could probably go down one Sunday and have a, have a, you know, have a lunch. It'll be Yeah. visit   It's not that far is it? Well it took us, as I say, an hour and a quarter. Pick me up on the way. Ha, ha, ha! Joke! I see , so we go round the M    twenty five, up to the M four    yes! Yes. Any minor detour. Any minor detour. There'll be convenient roadworks at Twickenham. I see.

I mean he died of, cancer, cancer of the lung, cancer of the lung, yes. Oh I didn't realize it was that. Oh I see. Mm. I didn't realize it was from smoking. And they said that er  yo , you're  you'll be war , the signs would  then, in fact, that er  there was a link up  Mm. with that. And until that I didn't reali  Oh I didn't realize he died cos  I, I, I, carried on smoking for a number of years after that. Well you never think it's gonna happen to you as well, for, I mean, anything. You never ever think But the thing is, with a number of these older people that smoke I, I think  they probably had mainly better tobacco, er, there's probably too  Yeah. many bloody chemicals added  Yeah. now  that do have a, a, sort of  a lasting effect. Yeah. I mean the majority of them now it's not even worth them stopping, and I mean, most of them are like  in their eighties and not, er eighties and there's like  the amount of damage they've done Well, it, it, it, it's terrible it's  by them stopping it's not gonna really do anything. it's the only, the, well they probably ta spend about  you know, half an hour of that trying to get up and stop the coughing  Well,Ma , you know Mark who stayed with us? Oh yeah. His chest is so bad, it really  ma , it's a bad smoker's cough. Oh. Horrendous! And he, he  reckons he smokes way too much. Mm mm. But basically that's because of  Well yes, the  his family, you know  family, yeah sure. Sure that's always outlet. sort of understand, yeah, something you've, you know, why he does it. Which is really sad. He's a really sweet guy . But erm Just thinks too much and smokes too much. Well  well I do , I heard it over the weekend in fact, that I can er, have er, another  BUPA medical to start with. Really? Er, yeah. At the place just not far  away from er, where I work. Oh that's quite good. So I , I mean, I've got to go in for that. Did you, what, do you have to pay for it? No, the bank pays. I see. Oh that's really good.

I suppose they must put these in the  the oven I would  Yeah. think, is er right? They have loads of them. Put them on most of the tables I think. Probably save them loads of money as well. Oh well.

Well it's a  It came at the right time. E each of them  approved. Yeah. Am I still covered under BUPA? I think so. Erm, I, I wa , when I get into work on Monday I'll have to find out. I'm not ill or anything  so don't worry at the moment . Er, but I , I, I, I think  erm  I think had it out up until Robert is baby. He, he's joined his own wo , he's joined his own. He joined his own, but I mean when he was at college. Yeah. I think he said he was covered actually. Well I don't know. Well I'll find out  so, at least then  er, if there is, you know, you're  Yeah. aware of, of what  Yeah. one can do. Well, it's, it's very, very handy actually. Oh sure. It's a very good thing  That's right. if you've got  the money, sort of, the means to do it Well I think  then do. the bank pays and it  Yeah. comes out from  from  Ye  from my tax. Yeah. I do , I'd, you know, from that point of view, as regards er health  in this kind, but to  know that you're covered rather  Yeah. than er Oh yeah. er ha , have problems  er er er, er when, when you  Definitely  require something. It's so much easier. Especially like my tonsils and stuff. That was like  the day I had them out was the day that my first N H S appointment would have been and it  it's like, you know  Yeah , er, yeah. what's the point in waiting around? Well Those tables things are quite good aren't they? Those little hoover things they use? Oh yes. Over there. Mm. Very interesting. Well it's different innit? Mm. Much quicker though. .Not very big actually is it? Big restaurant. No. I would have thought it would have ex extended by the door  No I don't think it does. but it doesn't. It's the Ah perhaps to the toilet. There's loads er like, in the window  when we, like  newspaper articles and  things where it's been recommended and stuff. Ah I see.

It's just such a shame because  th , the one day I knew they were playing it was James' birthday. Oh. And it seemed to silly to get on because obviously something was gonna happen. Yeah.

I take it we're leaving pretty quickly? No I, I had a feeling that I was gonna get landed with the bill there. Dear oh dear! It's the reason you came to see me. I thought it was a matter of going Dutch. I dunno. That's only on dates, you're my father. Is , oh oh. You  That doesn't count. Well let's see if I've got any money. My God! I think I paid it in. Makes me laugh! What a joker, eh? Mm mm. But those tender young hands will be  plunged in those dishes yet. I'm used to it. I do the dishes every day. Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Got a lot less at home than erm  I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it. Yeah. Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over  books. Sure. Oh  So  don't worry about that. That'll be their books  upstairs. Ah but it's silly because the thing is,th the they're, well the,th those,th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it! Oh yeah. Well that was the room as well that  we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there. There's a massive erm  I don't even know what you call it, of dope  like Oh yes. this, er in there  because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like  if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me Yeah sure. like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt. And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room. Oh this isn't our room. We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in  it was like  books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator  so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking. Oh dear! So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed. I saw him the other day and he said ah yo , have you, not leaking yet is it  from that radiator ? He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue. Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there. You know, like trying to stop it with our finger  Yeah, sure, yeah. and it was ju , it was burning our finger  Yo , yes sure. And squirting  And they  the yeah, they had like  like three towels. It's only , it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on? Yeah, that's what fell out. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever. Undid it too much, yeah sure. Yes you'd have to be  And then just it was, it was literally spurting out Yeah. and it , we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's  No, no, no. been pumped through Pumping through, yeah. And course it's got, pushing it  So we still had all this boiling water  Yeah. and we didn't  think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but  boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger. And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us. Mm mm. Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere  Oh God! Yeah. And you got, in the end we just laughed. And it, it came through to you? It came through yours? Yeah. Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was  I suddenly went  Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill  and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said  she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized. So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk  and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off  and of course it's not attached Oh! No! so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward. Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere! Oh God! And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse. What happened to your word processor? It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd  Oh I see. And then about erm  from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi , they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in. And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face! Oh no! Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to  Oh! like try and mend that. Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs. Oh God! And then he went into the bathroom  locked the door  and it was just silent. And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing Yeah. cos we were wo , we all got really worried, we're like, Mark. Mella Mentha? Bombay Cassata? Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a Lemon Delight. You Lemon Delight? Yeah. Mm. Sorry. Thanks. Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight. And erm  Delicious! Oh! Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir? Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah. Oh. Great! Tuck in. Start. No that's alright. It won't get cold. So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm  oh it won't get cold! I've just heard what you said. Oh dear. I'm on the ball tonight. Someone is slowing up. It's getting late. So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down. We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright? And there was no answer. So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down. Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like  , laugh, you know Mark  Oh God! having a laugh on our behalf. So he came out and  we really slapped him hard ! We thought that was  Oh God! really out of order. But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out  you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're  Oh God! in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out. And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and  he obviously wore himself out and like  was having a sleep. And we're just like, oh God! And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere. Oh no! Oh dear. And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really  sorry  state. He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going  oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on. So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg  on this plaster . And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it  trying to get home. Has he found a place now then or is he  Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth. Which is quite a way out actually. It's  What's  on the way to  and he's gotta , he's gotta come into here has he, every day? Yeah. Bloody hell! You alright? Yes. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a Lemon Delight. So, yeah  it's erm  I think he's living with  Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy. Oh I see. He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well. Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you? Oh eh? Oh he does it anyway. I think he'll just crash at our house. He knows he's  Yeah. he's more than welcome to crash at ours. I mean, it's quite, it's about  yeah, I don't know, he said it's  about a forty minute walk or something. Or  a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride. Oh yes. Our cycle ride's just about long enough. And he's, he, he he doesn't  It's get  drive? the worst bit is  Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway  it's sort of like  you know, it's like  Yeah, sure. Yes. that is, well that is , and that's like the longest, even  Mm. like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit. Yeah. Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across  basically you're just cutting across. Oh I see. Well yo well basically all the ma , there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it. Mm mm. And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college. And that's  you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever! Yeah. Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die! There's quite a stretch though there. Yeah. You can ca , and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it? Joining on the motorway bit. Mm. Made it for me specially. Yeah. Quite nice. Is it? It's beautiful. Mm. Bombay so ,si , er er  up there will be out now. It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into  Mm. college so yo , you know,yo whereas at home if you've got the home i , it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car. Oh sure. The weather's a bit grotty or  you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier  to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone. I don't mind cycling. What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much. Oh, oh ah! Everything's kept in ovens round here. In these little  Baby Belling type ones. I wonder how much money they make? They do pretty well. Oh yes. Right. Sorry about that. That's alright. Lovely, thanks very much. Okay. Thank you. , I got a brolly as well. Mm mm. Take that off. Go on break it. Go on. No, no, no. I shan't break it. There you  Oh well  are. you win it. No, I'll have to give it to you. Cheers honey. Er  Mm! Gorgeous! Is it? Mm. Want a bit? No I don't really like  not really into those sort of flavours. You can have my cherry though. Mm. What is it, pistachio  I might have a bit of pistachio actually. Nice actually. It's nice and light. Beautiful! So what time do you expect your  friends home this evening? Don't know. If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave  then I doubt they'll be back till a , about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back  if not, tomorrow morning or something. Mm. Well they're altogether so I suppose  Mm. in that way  they're relatively safe. So don't sit up worrying about them. But erm  they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway! Oh yes. Cos I was gonna go with them and then a , just would have  costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like,wai , transport there and transport back. Blimey! Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your  you know, it'll still be a long night. Yeah. But apparently, it's meant to be really good there. Really good erm  like Irish, sort of pub. Mm. Pub. But I would, I will go there sometime. But I  . Lovely. Mm. Is yours alright? Very nice. Want a bit? Oh that's nice. Something cold and refreshing actually. Mm. Cos next, well the week after the reading week  we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in. Oh oh! Will your transport be laid on or I don't know what, well the  I mean it's all paid for so we'd either  depending how many people are going   away or whatever Yeah. then erm  there  What's  might be a coach. If not, apparently, they've worked out  how everyone will actually go to school. So, you'll see. So I'll just see. But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out. Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm told to get the  whatever bus. Yeah. Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at  working it out for myself . Mm. Wouldn't have a clue. But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but  I don't really know. How often do you  that then? Well  the train. Cos a few people are further out than me so  cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth. Which is like  just a se , it's about  twenty minutes walk from our houses I think. Oh. So it's fine. Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired. Cos what's, well what's quite good is  you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term  so we've got a week off. Mm. And then we do another four weeks. Oh. I think the first week is just sort of basically erm  we share with the teacher and  only do, say, a couple of lessons a we , couple of lessons a day Sure. and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever. The, I think, well then after half term then it's more  us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after  Oh I see. half term. And what sort of age? I'm with erm  nine and ten years olds. Mm. Year five. Yeah. I think so. Oh yeah. I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before. Well thump them one will you? Every time they get cocky, thump them! Yeah. I've only taught erm  seven and eight year olds. So it'll be quite an experience. Mhm. It's gonna be so exhausting though. You get, we get assessed on it as well. Oh well. You fail those things and you're out basically. Is there a, is there, is that a fact? So you really have to have a  sort of strong character and in you go. And so  Yeah. Basically lesson pattern stuff. Cos when we go in  after winter break that's when we'll find out  er what topics they're doing  so we can plan our lessons and  Oh I see. fit in with whatever, like their curriculum. Well if you want anything  er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you? Cos I can always  sort of  Yeah. nip down of a  a weekend, collect it and then  Yeah. erm  bring it back to you. You know, if you need, it's a sort of trip of a  an evening. Yeah. Oh cheers. Well you're nearer than Robert was, yes. Yeah. Cos it's not too bad. It's really handy. I , yeah, I don't mind two hours on the motorway, it's, it's, it's nothing at all. It's a  you do a two and half hour stretch there and then a two and a half hours stretch back it's a  Yeah. rather heavy going. Well it's so handy though. It's really like, like a big plus side to it. Mm. I mean, especially if James is gonna go in London as well. Just so much easier to get  just to know that  if ever like  you know, eight or nine o'clock one night for whatever reason I wanted to come home I could be there like myself, in an hour. Oh sure. Yeah. Or people could be up within  Yeah. an hour to see me. Well just, in another way, it's more of an effort or whatever  to get people up. Most people that I know have got cars. Yes. Like Martin, and he's got no excuse for popping up. Well, I suppose er, he said he'd come down this time, so Mm. now he was at Richmond. And I phoned his house and he didn't phone back. Oh my God! He was down the pub. Beast! Dear oh dear! And he doesn't even drink! Him and Stuart go down, they have their half, half a Coke and, cos they know the landlord  where we did our er  Oh yeah. clay pigeon shooting. In , he loves it. Just goes there, chats to the landlord and  comes back  burning up down the country lanes as he goes.\",\n          \"IT IS Asian Week at Sotheby's and Christie's. They are mixing Islamic art from the Middle East with Indian and South-East Asian. The sales combine items of charm at fairly accessible prices with some rare treasures aimed at big-time collectors. Homely Persian pottery of the twelfth to thirteenth century combines animal and bird images with sinuous plant motifs and marks the beginning of lustre wares; they are mostly priced in the \\u00a3500 to \\u00a31,000 range and rate high on charm. The Iznik pottery from Turkey dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth century explodes with colour on more sophisticated white grounds; Iznik is now highly sought after by Turkish yuppies and prices run from \\u00a32,000 or so to \\u00a315,000. Both houses combine elegant early metalwares (twelfth/thirteenth century), bronze vessels with silver inlay \\u2014 which are expensive \\u2014 with nineteenth-century imitations, more flashy but in the mid-hundreds. There are plenty of Indian miniatures, colourful and charming evocations of princely courts, priced in hundreds or low thousands. Stone figures chipped off the war-torn temples of Cambodia are more expensive; a striking Khmer figure will cost \\u00a320,000 or more. There are also outstanding bits of Indian stone monuments, with gods and goddesses sensuously entwined in spiritual embrace; they start with the Gandhara grey schist carvings of the third/fourth century.

Finds: Old firm friends: John Windsor on a fight to save corporate archives from the bin By JOHN WINDSOR COMPANY records \\u2014 boring-sounding but the ultimate in historical memorabilia -have slipped through the fingers of British private collectors by the skipload. Only a sophisticated handful of collectors seek company minute books, ledgers and subject files to add historical depth to displayable hardware such as insurance firemarks or automobilia. It has fallen to salaried professionals in universities, public record offices, the Business Archives Council, corporate bodies themselves \\u2014 and the \\u2018vanity press\\u2019\\u2014 to salvage and conserve the tons of old papers explaining the historical context of what tumbled off the production line. As the heritage boom gathers pace, made-to-measure company and family biographies have become big business. For $27,000 (\\u00a316,800), the San Francisco vanity publisher The Sharper Image offers 225-page hardbound corporate histories in limited editions of 100, for use \\u2018as a public relations tool\\u2019. The London publisher Henry Melland offers corporate biographies for \\u00a35,000-\\u00a350,000, and lists among past and present clients BP and British Steel. A new British company, Living Memories, will produce an illustrated album of company or family biography for a typical price of \\u00a3500 for a family, \\u00a32,000 for a company. Most sophisticated of all, Terry Gourvish, director of the London School of Economics' business history unit, charges up to \\u00a3150,000 for a three to four-year company history project employing two full-time researchers. No vanity here: the result is a warts-and-all publication intended as salutary reading during management training. Rowntree and Glaxo are at present under his scrutiny. Such in-depth research is what Sunday-morning collecting should evolve into but seldom does. One of the few collectors dedicated enough to go for the company context is Peter Card, whose collection of 400 old bicycle lamps is without equal. As honorary archivist for Lucas, the motor components group, he begged the company to let him be custodian of the earliest archives -including Lucas family albums \\u2014 when, during company restructuring two years ago, the entire archive went to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Company archives are not that difficult to find. They tend to be the first victims of clean-sweep company shake-ups and takeovers. Expanding City firms hire skips to empty old papers out of basements and attics. I paid a Hackney second-hand dealer \\u00a3100 a few years ago for seven black plastic bags of documents dating back to the seventeenth century \\u2014 the contents of tin trunks removed from the basement of a firm of solicitors. They include the entire records, with a letters file, charting the heat-and- history of the London-based Egyptian Dredging Company, 1885-1938. There is also a complete and intimate record of the acrimonious relationship which developed between the Norwich Union Insurance Company and the founding manager of its London office in Edwardian times. Besides an at times emotional correspondence, the manager's bills for dinners, cigars and ladies' hats, and a vellum wallet full of used cheques are all intact, providing a documentary cameo of the life and times of an Edwardian financial rake. The thought of such treasures disappearing into private collections brings a sigh to Serena Kelly, secretary-general of the Business Archives Council. She has never had to compete with private collectors for company archives and hopes she never has to. As the Council's only full-time worker, she runs a one-woman intelligence operation, making friends with company archivists and hob-nobbing with big liquidators such as the London accountants Cork, Gully and Grant, Thornton, who allow her access to their warehouses of seized goods. She relies heavily on tip-offs, in turn alerting county and metropolitan records offices about historic company records due for release by liquidators. Two years ago, she and John Orbell, archivist of Baring Brothers and chairman of the Council's Liquidations and Rescue Support Group, were tipped off by a friendly Extel employee about the news agency's imminent takeover by United Newspapers. The voluminous Extel archives, giving a unique insight into Victorian journalists' news-gathering methods (and expenses claims) are now in London's Guildhall Library awaiting a researcher. We accompanied Pamela Scott-Wexo, a director of Living Memories, on a visit to one of her clients, the Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled servicemen at Richmond, Surrey, to see what her research would turn up. One resident, Jim Goodson, aged 105, who enlisted in the Army in 1902 at the age of 17, remembered being one of the first to be issued with a khaki uniform, an improvement on the red tunics which the Boers picked off so easily. She will include such memories in the home's 75th anniversary volume. Collecting: You're never alone with a print: Edward Lucie-Smith reports on why the modern multiple image is making a big impact in the blue-chip art market By EDWARD LUCIE-SMITH Many column inches have recently been devoted to the boom in classic modern and contemporary painting. Very little has been said about the boom in modern prints. In some ways this boom is even more extraordinary, because it represents not only a new taste but a subtly different attitude towards works of art. Peter Osborne of the Berkeley Square Gallery in London, which specialises in material of this kind, explained some of the rules of the print market. \\u2018A print of the right kind is not simply something that is worth money. It is more like actual currency. The reason is that while it may be in limited supply, it isn't unique. When other, identical examples exist, it is easy to establish what the value should be. It is also much easier to create a market situation which will see to it that the value goes up.\\u2019 Not every print, or every print-maker, is suitable for the purpose, however. The blue-chip market is confined to a very limited number of names. There are certain artists of the old Ecole de Paris: Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Rouault. There are certain contemporary American artists: Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Jim Dine, Sam Francis. There are also two British artists: Henry Moore and David Hockney. What are the rules of admission to the pantheon? First, the artist has to be a \\u2018major name\\u2019. Second, he has to be a prolific print-maker, and the prints themselves, though perhaps individually rare, must collectively be in reasonably good supply. Third, the prints must form an integral part of the artist's career \\u2014 that is, our appreciation of his achievement as a whole would be incomplete without some knowledge of his activity in this field. All of these are fairly obvious. But there are two other, less obvious laws as well. Prints, to be valuable, must be good impressions on good quality paper. Edvard Munch, whom many art historians would describe as one of the greatest print-makers of the century, fails to qualify as \\u2018blue-chip\\u2019, despite occasional high prices at auction, because he often used poor quality paper and the impressions are not always of the best quality. The final qualification is that a print-maker, to reach the very top of the tree, must be known and appreciated by the Japanese. The Berkeley Square Gallery, for example, maintains a second outlet in Tokyo, as a vital part of its operations. Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints, because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage. They do not make the distinction between an image on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious \\u2014 indeed axiomatic \\u2014 to Europeans. They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists \\u2014 Hokusai, for instance, and Hiroshige \\u2014 made print-making a primary creating medium. Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image \\u2014 to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing. The way the market in prints moves is very much governed by developments in Japanese taste. \\u2018The first generation of collectors was very conservative,\\u2019 said Mr Osborne. \\u2018They tended to like what was soft-edged and pretty.\\u2019 As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive \\u2014 over \\u00a320,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing. This makes a striking contrast with Manet, whose prints, though rare, are modest in scale and not found in signed, numbered editions. The Berkeley Square Gallery has an example of his Infanta Margarita (After Velazquez) for only \\u00a31,250. But now a new generation of Japanese collectors is coming into the market and their taste is for much stronger, more colourful things, such as prints by Miro. Something they have not developed a liking for yet is prints by the German Expressionists and their successors, the artists of the Neue Sachlichkeit such as Beckmann and Grosz. Occasionally, they take a liking to a European or American artist who is not really an absolutely major name internationally. An example is the American Carol Summers, who makes superb, coloured woodcuts. What they appreciate here is the closeness to their own tradition \\u2014 Hokusai's prints are coloured woodcuts, too \\u2014 and superb quality. How much do real blue-chip prints tend to cost? This is fairly easy to answer, but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again. A recent major commercial show of Miro's work, for example, took all his prices to a new high. A big coloured image, such as the aptly named Le Samourai, will now cost \\u00a325,000. Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more \\u2014 up to \\u00a345,000. So do major prints by Sam Francis (who lived and worked for a while in Japan). The benchmark here is over \\u00a350,000. Matisse and Picasso, who form the backbone of the market in \\u2018classic modern\\u2019 prints, bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the image and its attractiveness. A beautiful odalisque by Matisse, such as Torso with a Jug, typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s, will bring \\u00a335,000 or more. Images from Picasso's eternally popular Vollard Suite, which dates from the early 1930s, bring between \\u00a38,000 and \\u00a312,000 plus \\u2014 but these, though easy to like because of their smooth neo-classical style, are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition. The established artist who is currently rising most rapidly in price is Hockney. Images from the mid-1970s \\u2014 large prints of swimming pools, vases of flowers and interiors (all nice, neutral subjects) were till recently anchored at around \\u00a315,000. In recent months they have begun to tear loose from this platform. Today, \\u00a320,000 might be a good guess for an especially attractive image and Mr Osborne predicts that the price will soon be nearer to \\u00a330,000. Obviously a good choice for collectors who like their blue-chips gilded. But what about the long-term future? One problem is that there do not seem to be many potentially blue-chip names in the pipeline, ready to join what is now a severely restricted group. The Neo-Expressionists mostly seem too dour to qualify \\u2014 and most do not make prints on a sufficiently regular basis. One answer seems to be that the market will take another look at Impressionist prints, and those by the Nabis, both of which are beginning to seem undervalued, in comparison with what was produced by their successors. You can get a fine Bonnard print for \\u00a32,500; a Pissarro for less than \\u00a37,000. Signac, who continued his activity as a print-maker into the period after the First World War, uses the graphic medium superbly. A tip-top specimen costs \\u00a310,000. Even Cezanne's rare prints are starting to look a bit undervalued, in terms of the way in which the market as a whole is performing. Move over Hockney, Uncle Paul is behind you. If this is the way things go, there would be a certain art-historical justice in it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DEM\",\n          \"NEWS\",\n          \"ACA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

PAGE Havel, the young playwright in the late 1960s A writer still?. IS CZECHOSLOVAKIA likely to gain a president in Vaclav Havel and lose a dramatist? It seems unlikely. One of the striking things about Havel is his commitment to drama over the past quarter-century and his insistence, in the period immediately before the Czech revolution, that he was first and foremost a writer. I had occasion in late October to present a brief profile of Havel as a preface to a Radio 4 presentation of his latest play, Redevelopment. In the course of it Edward Lucas, a BBC Prague correspondent, asked Havel directly if he wanted to be president. He said that he could not imagine conditions arising that would make it possible, stressed the collective nature of the democratic movement and said \\u2018I cannot forever play this dual role of amateur politician and writer.\\u2019 Earlier this summer he similarly told the Observer's Mark Frankland \\u2018The more I am forced to be active in politics, the more I enjoy doing theatre.\\u2019 History moves fast these days. But what persuades me that we have not heard the last of Havel the writer is that he combines a total commitment to social freedom and individual responsibility with an extraordinary ironic detachment. In both his plays and essays \\u2014 recently issued in paperback by Faber under the title Living In Truth \\u2014 he shows a remarkable gift for analysing the dilemmas of the dissident in a repressive society. He is both participant and observer: \\u2018a sceptical, sober, anti-Utopian, understated mind\\u2019(in his own words) confronting the business of opposing state power with rueful self-awareness. Havel is now in the seat of power; but I cannot imagine he has lost his central European gift for irony. At first, I suspect, we got Havel wrong in this country: on the strength of an early play like The Memorandum (1965) we pigeonholed him as an Absurdist along with Beckett and Ionesco. In that early work, memorably presented on TV and radio, we see a monolithic state organisation attempting to replace the existing vernacular with a synthetic language, Ptydepe, that will iron out the ambiguities and imprecisions of everyday speech. But where true Absurdism, as Vera Blackwell pointed out, posited a meaningless universe, Havel's aim was \\u2018the improvement of man's lot through the improvement of man's institutions.\\u2019 Havel has written constantly about the oppressive nature of Communist bureaucracy. But in recent years his plays have been more about the paradoxical nature of dissidence itself: the emotional turbulence of the authority given the individual as a public spokesman, and about the fact that one of the worst features of any totalitarian system is the need to conform to other people's expectations. Havel explored the dilemmas of the dissident with wry comedy in The Vanek Plays (Audience, Protest and Private View) written in the mid-70s. In the best of them, Audience, Havel capitalises on his own experience of working in a brewery at Trutnov stacking empty beer barrels. In the play we see Vanek (a lightly disguised version of Havel) summoned for an interview by the brewery's lager-swilling Head Maltster. He finds that he is being offered a simple trade-off: a comfortable job as a stock-checker if he will provide incriminating information about himself which the Maltster can then pass on to the Party. The sting lies in the tail when Vanek bends his principles to accommodate his desperate interrogator. What Havel wittily shows is the kind of Catch-22 situation faced by a dissident in a despotism: whether to cling fiercely to your own moral integrity (thereby landing others in the shit) or whether to conform and perpetuate a corrupt system. EVEN after nearly four years in prison (where, characteristically, he turned the permitted weekly letter to his wife into philosophical essays) Havel was able to dramatise the dissident's dilemma with a mixture of recollected pain and resilient humour. Largo Desolato, written in the early 80s is about the difficulty of being a moral hero in an immoral society. Havel's protagonist is a philosopher caught in a double bind. He has offended the state with a work called The Ontology of the Human Self and an openly provocative paper (much as Havel himself did with his Open Letter to President Husak of 1975). But his simple desire for seclusion is imperilled by a succession of visitors. On the one hand, two fans from a papermill implore him to become a dissident figurehead: on the other hand, two state policmen want him to sign a document denying authorship of the original article. One sympathises with Havel's predicament. At the same time the play leaves a key question tantalisingly unresolved: whether, in a repressive state, one can seek freedom for oneself without seeking it for others. And this raises the question of whether Havel's talent had begun to be affected by the nervous strain of writing under surveillance and of not having seen any of his work performed since 1969. Any fears, however, that Havel's talent might be going off were for me resolved by the broadcast version of Redevelopment, given a dramatised reading by the RSC in February under the title Slum Clearance. This is a major work: a dense, multi-layered allegory with its roots firmly in reality. It is set in a medieval castle in a historic town in Eastern Europe. Supervised by a state functionary (with a sqeaking shoe) and led by an emotionally-chaotic project director, a group of architects struggle to come up with a high-rise building scheme that will destroy the ancient town's character and, incidentally, clear away its slums. On the realistic level, the play is about a universal architectural dilemma: how to achieve a balance between conservation and civic improvement. But it also works as a political metaphor about the whimsical arbitrariness of autocracy with the architects first working under strict supervision and then being granted an illusory whiff of freedom. This is vintage Havel: creating a work that is both specific and universal, tragic and comic. It leaves me speculating that Havel the artist is unlikely to be displaced by Havel the politican. For the moment, he obviously has more urgent tasks than writing plays. But he is unlikely to be satisfied forever with the illusion of power. Michael Billington t Where all the nuts are Trumps Gumpets. By Beverly Pagram GUMNUTLAND \\u2014 twinned with Willesden Junction, says the sign over the platform. The station master is wearing a hat shaped like a cucumber. There's a small green dog asleep in the ticket office. Gumnutland is on a branch line at Wanneroo, near Perth in Western Australia. None of its inhabitants is more than three inches high. Made of eucalyptus gumnuts, banksia nuts, dried wildflower petals and seedpods, these homuncules would have confounded Gulliver. They throng the streets and mini-timbered buildings of Gumnutland in their hundreds. Beside the chuffing narrow gauge train, travel-weary \\u2018Gumpets\\u2019 wait with their titchy acorn prams and seed-case luggage. There are swarms of Gumpets going to school, to the office, to the bank, waiting outside the grocers' for cut-price Cadbury's Fruit & Nut. This remarkable scene is the showpiece of a workshop-museum and export business called The Gumnut Factory. It has become such an attraction that local tour operators are beating a path to its door. Perth is proud of its image as a breeding ground for don't-take-no-for-an-answer entrepreneurs. It's not surprising, therefore, that a 33-year-old former London motor mechanic has turned a A$200 garden shed operation into an expanding enterprise with a A$250,000 per year turnover. What is extraordinary is that Chris Trump is raking it in with nature table whimsy, rather than oil, beer, or newspapers. In Perth souvenir shops, Gumpets are elbowing their way on to the shelves alongside the stock-in-trade plywood boomer angs, mallee-root ornamental clocks and kangaroo-skin sporrans. Recently Trump has sold three Gumnut Factory shop franchises \\u2014 two to New South Wales tourist outlets and one to a Californian company. Consignments of his nutty bushwackers are on their way to UK gift shops to compete with fir-cones in frocks and teasel mice. This Trumping of the souvenir market goes back to a boyhood in Portsmouth and a hobby of collecting shells and making creatures out of them. \\u2018When I came here with my parents in 1974 and saw that most of the \\u2018Australian\\u2019 souvenirs were imported from Hong Kong and the Philippines, I decided to try and break into the market,\\u2019he recalled. Retail outlets and distributors alike told him where to stick his gumnuts. The Small Business Advice Bureau said there was not much call for banksia-blossom owls. But by 1979 he was selling enough stock from his Mum's garden shed to move into the Wanneroo premises. Also in the pipeline is an Australian children's TV series based on Gumnut Factory Folk Tales (written, illustrated and published by Chris Trump, A$7.95). Cynics might observe that Trump is exploiting his relationship with wee George and Gertie Gumnut et al. In fact he takes his role as guardian of these fey fellahin so seriously that perhaps one should regard him as the Brobdingnagian Mayor of Gumnutland. The Gumnut Factory is at 30 Prindiville Drive, Wangara Centre, WA 6065. Feature Tours, Australian Pacific and Bus Australia all make regular visits. Where brass makes music Critic's choice Music.. By Gerald Larner FOLLOWERS of the BBC Philharmonic \\u2014 that small but discriminating section of the concert audience in the North-west \\u2014 will have noticed a peculiarly high proportion of works featuring solo trumpet in the orchestra's current programmes. Earlier this month Elgar Howarth conducted the BBC PO in Christopher Sansom's Invisible Cities for trumpet and trombone and orchestra, with Hakan Hardenberger and Christian Lindberg. In the RNCM on Friday they are playing Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's Trumpet Concerto, with Hakan Hardenberger as soloist. In Studio 7 on January 11 they are playing Michael Blake Watkins's Trumpet Concerto, again with Hakan Hardenberger. The reason behind this concentrated specialist activity is that Hardenberger, Howarth, and the BBC PO are making a record of the Maxwell Davies and Blake Watkins concertos together with Harrison Birtwistle's Endless Parade, which last they performed so well and so memorably at York University last season. For Hardenberger \\u2014 the brilliant young Swedish trumpeter for whom the Birtwistle and the Blake Watkins pieces were written and who would have commissioned the Maxwell Davies if John Wallace hadn't go there first \\u2014 it is an exciting project. \\u2018To me these three pieces are possibly better than anything written for my instrument.\\u2019 What anything?, I asked, desperately trying to think of great composers who have written great trumpet concertos. \\u2018Yes, although the Haydn can possibly compete.\\u2019 The point is that it has taken players like Wallace and Hardenberger to contradict the cliches about the limitations of the instrument and to prove how flexible it really is. Indeed, with what he callls its \\u2018huge range of expression\\u2019 as well as its power to fill even the largest concert hall, Hardenberger feels that the trumpet is a particularly valuable instrument for the contemporary composer. He points to the three British works in the recording project to demonstrate what variety it has to offer \\u2014 the \\u2018hard black-and-white\\u2019 sound of the Birtwistle, the comparitively florid \\u2018flute or clarinet-like writing\\u2019in the Maxwell Davies Concerto, the \\u2018very expansive\\u2019trumpet part in the Blake Watkins, which is a \\u2018wonderfully lyrical work without being sweet or silly in any way.\\u2019 Hardenberger is particularly happy that his partners in the concerts and in the recording are Elgar Howarth and the BBC Philharmonic. Howarth, a fellow student of Birtwistle and Maxwell Davies (who wrote the Trumpet Sonata, Op.1, for him) in Manchester in the 1950s, is himself a trumpet player as well as a specialist conductor of contemporary music. Hardenberger also recalls that the BBC PO's York performance of Endless Parade \\u2014 a work so difficult in its string scoring that two or three other orchestras have actually refused to play it with him \\u2014 is the best he has taken part in so far. I get the impression that, of the three, Hardenberger's favourite is the Blake Watkins Concerto, which he considers \\u2018very English, more traditional perhaps but without being in any way limited. The orchestration is wonderful and there is an absolutely beautiful trumpet part.\\u2019 On the other hand, he says, \\u2018I feel such an enormous amount of emotion in all three pieces. It's not really up to me to judge that they are the best ever. But we shall see in 200 years if I am right.\\u2019 Trumpeter as soloist\\u2026 Hakam Hardenbergher: see Critic's choice THIS CAPTION FOR N-WEST TABLOID Robert Hands and Tracey Childs in a musical treatment of Great Expectations; Liverpool Playhouse: see Theatre PAGE\",\n          \"First the coach broke down.

THEY'RE ALL AT IT Sir Colin: \\u2018We don't know what to do about ball tampering\\u2019 Spot checks are likely COLIN PRICE SIR Colin Cowdrey admitted last night: \\u2018They're all tampering with the ball.\\u2019 The chairman of the International Cricket Council, talking in Sri Lanka, said the ball doctoring issue exposed in the Mirror by Allan Lamb is cricket's biggest headache. He claimed all countries have been guilty of tampering with the ball and conceded: \\u2018We don't know what we are going to do, and the countries don't know the answer. \\u2018The problem is that when a new trick appears, everyone is trying to see what advantages they can get from it. Everyone knows that all countries try it.\\u2019 Sir Colin flies back to England later this week to try to sort out the storm over the Pakistanis. But he may well have kicked up another by exposing the eight other Test-playing nations. Certainly, England were reported to Lord's by umpire John Holder for a marked ball during last summer's final Test against West Indies. Holder, despite rave reports from Pakistan after standing as a neutral umpire in the series against India, hasn't umpired another England Test since. The Test and County Cricket Board almost managed to hush up that incident \\u2014 but BBC TV commentator Jack Bannister exposed it in a book months later. And New Zealand admit Chris Pringle became so angry at Pakistan's tricks that he produced life-time best Test figures of 11 for 152 after scuffing the ball. Kiwi manager Ian Taylor took the unprecedented step of telling the world what had happened because he wanted the ICC to investigate Pakistan. But the ICC did what they did with Lamb's evidence last week and with West Indies skipper Desmond Haynes's complaint about them in Karachi in 1991 \\u2014 exactly nothing. Now that Lamb has blown the whole affair into the open, Sir Colin must see the cheats are exposed and the door slammed forever on the ball doctors, whichever country they belong to. One suggestion is that the umpires should inspect the ball at the fall of every wicket, or at unscheduled stops, instead of the end of each over when bowlers have the chance to cover their traces. That change might be in place by the time Pakistan visit West Indies this winter. THIS is the kind of ball doctoring of which Sir Colin Cowdrey says all Test-playing countries are guilty. MIRROR SPORT headlines last week JOLLY GREEN GIANT HUGH JAMIESON VICENTE Fernandez won the English Open at The Belfry after sinking one of the longest putts ever to win a golf title. The jubilant 46-year-old Argentinian celebrated landing the \\u00a391,660 first prize with a head-over-heels roll then dedicated his moment of glory to soccer boss pal Ossie Ardiles. After pipping Swedish pair Per-Ulrik Johansson and Fredrik Lindgren, by one shot, thanks to birdies at the last two holes, he said: \\u2018I was so far away I just about saw the ball disappear. It was great that Ossie was there \\u2014 he's my hero.\\u2019 West Bromwich boss Ardiles, an enthusiastic 15-handicap golfer, said: \\u2018I've known Vicente for a long time. \\u2018Like him, I couldn't see the putt drop in but the gallery's roar said it all.\\u2019 ARDILES: Close pal BERN UP MIDDLESBROUGH boss Lennie Lawrence has appealed to Jack Charlton: \\u2018Don't forget Bernie!\\u2019 Boro's Bernie Slaven started the season with two goals against Manchester City and starred in the win over Leeds under Charlton's watchful eye. But the 31-year-old striker can't get his place back in the Republic of Ireland squad. Said Lawrence: \\u2018I'm disappointed. I reckon he deserves a call-up and I want that mentioned. \\u2018You've got to respect what Jack does \\u2014 but Bernie has started the season as well as anybody here.\\u2019 Lawrence was also disappointed by Scotland's decision to overlook midfielder Willie Falconer but new signing Derek Whyte is in the party to face Switzerland. All three get the chance to put their case against Ipswich tonight. Winger John Hendrie misses the match with a calf injury. SLAVEN: Left out HOME TIME WIMBLEDON are set to roll out the red carpet and bring back their original Crazy Gang member Alan Cork. Manager Joe Kinnear, robbed of injured ace striker John Fashanu, sees Sheffield United's cult hero Corky as the vital replacement to ease the club's injury problems. Cork, Wimbledon's record busting striker, left reluctantly after 12 glorious years \\u2014 and immediately won the hearts of the Yorkshire club's fans. The 32-year-old helped Sheffield stay in big time soccer but Dave Bassett wouldn't stand in his way if a move back South came up. CORK: Return Hull axe bad boy LEIGH Jenkinson has been fined \\u00a3100, dropped from tonight's game against Swansea and transfer listed by Hull City boss Terry Dolan for gesturing to a fan. Jenkinson blew his top after missing a penalty at Plymouth on Friday night. BLOW FOR GARY Mercer out for two months MARTIN RICHARDS LEEDS were last night reeling from the shock that new-signing Gary Mercer had broken his jaw in Sunday's opening defeat by St Helens. The Kiwi Rugby League forward, playing his first game for the club since a summer move from Warrington, will be sidelined for eight to 10 weeks. Mercer, who picked up the injury in the first 20 minutes, was substituted by Andy Goodway but bravely returned in the second half wearing a protective head guard. \\u2018It's a sickening blow to us,\\u2019 said Leeds chief executive Alf Davies. \\u2018Gary showed great courage in coming back in the second half even though the injury was very painful.\\u2019 Mercer, who will have the jaw wired to-morrow, said: \\u2018It's the first serious injury I've had and I've never felt as flat as this. I knew I had done something when I went down in the tackle.\\u2019 Despite Mercer's injury, Leeds say they've still not finalised a two-year deal for Aussie Test back rower Bob Lindner. And manager Doug Laughton gave an intriguing twist to Leeds search for a top overseas three-quarter by saying: \\u2018I'm negotiating with one of the biggest names in Australian Rugby League \\u2014 and it's not Mal Meninga.\\u2019 \\u2018If he signs it will be like all the fireworks going off on Bonfire Night.\\u2019 Lindner announced on Aussie network TV on Saturday that he'd signed for Leeds, but Davies said they still hadn't received final confirmation from the player. Lindner is sure to be in Australia's World Cup squad which leaves early next month to prepare for the final against Great Britain at Wembley on October 23. HE'LL BE THE BEST Souness backs the James boy RICHARD TANNER GRAEME SOUNESS last night defended his \\u00a31.3 million goalkeeper David James by declaring: \\u2018He can be the best.\\u2019 James, 22, has marred some brilliant early-season displays for Liverpool with some alarming lapses. The former Watford star was at fault for Leeds' late equaliser on Saturday and one of Ipswich's goals last Tuesday. He also admits he should have prevented goals in earlier games against Sheffield United and Arsenal. But Souness is backing the player who has taken over from Bruce Grobbelaar, Anfield's first-choice keeper for the last 11 seasons. He said: \\u2018I'm pleased with him. He's a young man with as much potential as any keeper I've ever seen. That's why we bought him. \\u2018David had a very good game at Leeds, apart from not applying the golden rule of playing until the ref blows his whistle. \\u2018He fully accepts the responsibility for their late goal. But at the same time he deserves a pat on the back because of some of the saves he had to make. \\u2018Hopefully, he'll learn something from Saturday and from the other games we've played so far. And one day soon he might fulfil all that potential.\\u2019 James hopes for a double celebration today \\u2014 an England call-up and his first clean sheet for Liverpool in tonight's clash with Southampton at Anfield. Poor The Merseysiders have made their poorest start for 11 years with only five points from five games. But skipper Mark Wright believes they should look on the bright side of the draws at Ipswich and Leeds \\u2014 despite throwing away a win in each game. Wright said: \\u2018After the disappointment of the Arsenal defeat, we've bounced back with two creditable performances and haven't been beaten at places where it's hard to get results. \\u2018We were in winning positions in both games so we can't be playing that badly. \\u2018But it was disappointing to throw away four points with silly late errors. We must apply ourselves right to the end of games.\\u2019 Injuries continue to disrupt Liverpool. Paul Stewart has joined Steve Nicol on the injured list after damaging a hamstring at Leeds. But Michael Thomas could be back after missing the last two games with a twisted ankle. SUPER SAVER DAVID JAMES may have made a few mistakes but he is learning all the time, says Liverpool boss Graeme Souness (inset). James is hoping to celebrate a double today \\u2014 an England call-up and his first clean sheet for his new club. REID RECALL KEN LAWRENCE PETER REID starts his first match in six months at Wimbledon tonight bidding to force Manchester City back on the championship trail. The 36-year-old player-manager will play himself at the expense of either Steve McMahon or Rick Holden, both of whom cost \\u00a3900,000. Reid said: \\u2018As far as I am concerned it is no big deal that I am coming back \\u2014 I simply feel the time is right for me. \\u2018I can still win the ball, pass it, and have a lot to give on the pitch. \\u2018I thought we played some good stuff against Oldham but when you concede three goals you obviously have problems \\u2014 if you score three at home you should run out winners.\\u2019 McMahon faces his first crisis since moving to Maine Road from Anfield last season. But Reid, who is also considering giving brilliant youngster Gary Flitcroft his full debut, stressed: \\u2018There is no problem with Steve even though he was substituted on Saturday \\u2014 to be fair to him he has been fighting a toe injury.\\u2019 REID: He's in action again for Manchester City tonight WE'RE IN IT FOR KICKS! Crocked Hirst clears Bould MATT HUGHES DAVID HIRST last night cleared Arsenal's Steve Bould of blame for the challenge that has destroyed his England recall hopes. Sheffield Wednesday striker Hirst was chopped down early in Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Highbury. And many observers thought the booked Bould was lucky to stay on the field for his tackle from behind. But Hirst, carrying the legacy of a cracked left ankle, harbours no bitterness despite being forced out of the running for England's first fixture of the season. \\u2018I have no hard feelings towards Steve,\\u2019 insisted Hirst, who looked certain to make today's squad for the September 9 friendly in Spain after his five-goal start. \\u2018I watched the tackle on TV and he came through me. But strikers are there to get kicked just as defenders are there to kick them. \\u2018It's my job to get past him and his job is to stop me. Besides, I don't think anyone sets out with the intention of hurting people. \\u2018Steve has no reason to feel responsible and I don't think he will. It's just part of the game.\\u2019 Casualties Meanwhile, England keeper Chris Woods has joined Wednesday's alarming casualty list after being taken ill with food poisoning. Manager Trevor Francis could now be without half a dozen senior players for Coventry's visit tomorrow. He is already missing Hirst, Chris Waddle, John Sheridan and Phil King, who faces several months on the sidelines after surgery today to repair damaged knee ligaments. And Francis has yet to decide whether he can recall Carlton Palmer, who was axed at the weekend because illness has  affected his form. Said Francis: \\u2018Carlton's virus seems to be lingering so he'll see the doctor before we reassess his situation.\\u2019 DAVID Hirst bears no grudge over his injured ankle BOULD: Tackle JINX BUSTERS! Mac out for Royle revenge WALTER STOREY GARY McALLISTER tonight aims to blast away Leeds United's Boundary Park jinx and prove his wonder goal against Liverpool was no fluke. Leeds haven't won at Joe Royle's Oldham in their last seven attempts but McAllister warned: \\u2018That's a record we're bursting to put right. My scoring output since I left Leicester hasn't been good \\u2014 but after that goal against Liverpool maybe I can start improving.\\u2019 McAllister's stunning volley captivated millions of Match of the Day viewers and brought into sharp focus the mystery of his goal drought. He said: \\u2018It's been a fabulous two years for me at Leeds and the lack of goals has been my only disappointment. \\u2018It is something I've been working hard to improve. Double figures should be a realistic target, especially now I am the penalty-taker at Elland Road.\\u2019 Fierce McAllister, 27, has one of the fiercest shots in the Premier League, yet he managed only six goals in all competitions during his first season at Elland Road. And last season he scored just five. Now he is confident of shaking off a hamstring strain and extending his ever-present League record to 86 matches since his \\u00a31 million move from Leicester. \\u2018Oldham have a great record against us over the years,\\u2019 he adds. \\u2018The goals are flying in for them, too. But they are also leaking goals, so we can nail our Boundary Park jinx once and for all.\\u2019 Meanwhile Eric Cantona returns to the scene of his English soccer baptism, with McAllister excited by the Frenchman's surge of form. Cantona hardly had a kick when he made his debut at Oldham as a second-half  substitute in a 2-0 defeat last February. \\u2018Eric has come a long way since then,\\u2019 said McAllister. \\u2018He's worked so hard at his game and he's much more involved than when he first came over from France.\\u2019 McALLISTER: Target MARTIN PIPE'S six-timer attempt at Newton Abbot yesterday was foiled \\u2014 twice. The West Country trainer and champion jockey Peter Scudamore got  off to a flying start winning the first three races with odds-on shots Mohana, Slavi and Skipping Tim. But then Myverygoodfriend finished second and after Galway Star had become their fourth odds-on scorer, Passed Pawn failed in the last race. CHEERS LLOYD CHARLES FAWCUS JOCKEY Jeff Lloyd gets kicked out of the saddle this week-end \\u2014 but it's all in the rules of the game. The South African-based rider landed his seventh British win on Rocality at Epsom, but his 30-day permit expires on Saturday. \\u2018I'm shattered. I had hoped to carry on here for another two weeks, but the Jockey Club have told me to stop,\\u2019 said the Epping-born rider. Lloyd is caught up in a worldwide agreement which limits a foreign-based jockey to a 30-day stay. It's different for Michael Roberts and Steve Cauthen who ride on British licences. \\u2018It would be different for Jeff as well if he had a job here, but he's just on holiday. If I went to South Africa with a British licence the situation would be the same for me,\\u2019 said Derby-winning jockey John Reid. Amateur Steve Swiers brought David Elsworth in from the cold on Statajack, also at Epsom. Statajack was David's first win for nearly a month and the big time could come with Seattle Rhyme who reappears against Derby third Silver Wizard and Jeune at Kempton on Saturday. \\u2018Cash Asmussen has turned down six rides in France for him, so he must fancy his chances,\\u2019 smiled the trainer. MICHAEL Tebbutt picked up a four-day ban for excessive use of the whip when beaten a short head on Briggsmaid by Vain Prince at Newcastle. \\u2018I had a very fair hearing and accept the stewards' decision. I hit the horse 13 times in a very tight finish,\\u2019 said Tebbutt. FOR GOD'S SAKE PICK THESE MEN ALF RAMSEY GIVES IT TO YOU STRAIGHT Taylor must go for Wright and Beardo TONY STENSON GRAHAM TAYLOR now has a second chance to get it Wright for England! No one has to tell the England manager he got it terribly wrong with his selection for the European championship matches in Sweden. He was given more than enough encouragement to pick players like Arsenal's 30-goal Ian Wright \\u2014 but he ignored all the cries. I plead with him to get it right this time for his own sake. Because if his squad selection today for next week's friendly in Spain fails, then by God he will feel the full wrath of his critics \\u2014 and no one need tell me how that feels. I can assure Graham he will be the loneliest man in football, reviled by people who haven't the first clue about the game, but who will go right along with the bloodsuckers willing him to fail. When he names the most-important squad of his England career \\u2014 the one that could make or break him \\u2014 I do hope he includes the names of Wright and Everton's Peter Beardsley. Taylor must bury any recriminations about Beardsley turning his back on England. Surprise You pick your best players and there is little doubt on current form that Beardsley is one of England's finest forwards. Beardsley would be my surprise choice for England's game in Santander next Wednesday, but I also think there should be a place for Wright. I would ignore the claims of Nottingham Forest's Nigel Clough and Southampton's Matthew Le Tissier, but I'll explain why later. Beardsley? I can hear a chuckle in some quarters but I feel he never let England down. He was dropped too early \\u2014 but instead of sulking he has returned with his old fire. Beardsley and David Platt would provide a very mobile midfield that also has an eye for goals. Wright, a player I've admired since he made a name for himself at Crystal Palace, was strangely ignored for the European championship finals. I say strangely because finishing as the League's top striker surely warrants a travelling place even if only for experience. Everyone knew Gary Lineker was saying farewell to international football and a new dawn was beckoning. Wright could have sat, watched, learned and even been given a short burst to discover again what the international arena is all about. Taylor now has a problem. Does he go for new tactics or again show faith in the squad he took to Sweden? I see Blackburn's \\u00a33.6million man Alan Shearer again being part of Graham's thoughts, which at the moment seem to be pointing towards the long ball game. Shearer, an instant hit at Blackburn, has yet to convince me. He's good. Brilliant? I am not yet sure. From what I've seen and heard, Graham seems to be looking to a big man with the ball aimed for the sky. There's nothing wrong in that belief provided you do it properly. There's no half measures to playing this way. It's all or nothing and being strong enough to take the flak if things go wrong. Mobile I was my own man and played the way I believed because we lacked talent in certain areas. Jack Charlton, one of my team of 1966, turns his back to criticism as manager of the Republic of Ireland. He does it his way and that's how a manager, be it at club or international level, should act. Sadly for Graham we haven't got too many players of true international quality to spearhead his attack this way. There aren't too many big, strong, mobile strikers with the skill to hold the ball and allow the midfield to feed off him. Calls for Le Tissier come from some quarters because of his good partnership with Shearer while at Southampton. I don't agree. Le Tissier is a very good club player but he has yet to prove himself. I feel he needs to be in a winning side, one brimming with confidence before he sparkles. At the moment we haven't got an England side to fit his needs. Clough is someone I've long admired, a tremendous club player who no doubt makes his dad Brian very proud. I'm trying not to be unkind but I doubt whether he has the requirements for international football and I wouldn't be surprised if he's missing from next week's squad. To ensure it won't be a pain in Spain I expect Graham to rely on his tested experienced players and sprinkle them with a blend of youth. I'd like to think Beardsley and Wright will get the nod and Graham doesn't get it wrong again. HE'S THE TOPS STRIKER Peter Beardsley has this season rediscovered his best form with Everton after being dropped too early by England. DAVID PLATT would be a hit with Beardsley IAN WRIGHT should have gone to Sweden with England this summer and now deserves a recall for the friendly in Spain. SHEARER: Taylor choice LE TISSIER: Doesn't fit in STRIFE OF SAD BRIAN HARRY HARRIS BRIAN CLOUGH is facing the biggest crisis of his managerial career. A 3-1 defeat at new table-toppers Norwich last night left Clough with the indignity of his worst-ever start in 18 years at Nottingham Forest. Worse still, Forest are third from bottom, having conceded more goals in their opening five matches than any team. Lee Power, Dave Phillips and Ian Crook humbled Forest, inflicting their fourth consecutive defeat. When Phillips scored the third goal for Norwich a minute before time it was the twelfth that Clough's side have conceded. Nigel Clough did more than anyone to avert a crisis for his old man. Watched by England manager Graham Taylor, Clough struck a superb goal after 31 minutes. That equalised Norwich's strike within 100 seconds of the start \\u2014 a 25-yard free-kick from Ian Crook. Forest's only victory this season was in their first match \\u2014 at home to Liverpool. Then Teddy Sheringham blasted a terrific goal \\u2014 but since then he has been sold to Spurs. But it is in defence where Clough faces his biggest problem \\u2014 now that he no longer has Des Walker. CLOUGH: Problems TERRIER Gibson's set to go TONY STENSON WIMBLEDON striker Terry Gibson could start a \\u00a34 million transfer merry-go-round between Manchester City, Chelsea and Coventry. Little Gibson, 29, and so forgotten that he trains alone, was once part of Terry Phelan's \\u00a32.3 million move to Manchester City. But the deal collapsed when City looked at their bank account. Now they're talking again and Gibson will meet manager Peter Reid before tonight's match at Selhurst Park. But Coventry's Bobby Gould sees Gibson as the ideal replacement for Kevin Gallacher, who seems destined for a \\u00a32 million move to Chelsea. So it seems Wimbledon, who have cashed in on \\u00a312 million of talent since winning the FA Cup in l988, could be in for more money. But one player ready to head back to Wimbledon is Alan Cork, 32, one of their original Crazy Gang. Manager Joe Kinnear, robbed of the injured John Fashanu, sees Cork as a short-term solution \\u2014 and Sheffield United's Dave Bassett would not stand in the way of his great pal. Kinnear tried to talk to Graham Taylor yesterday to push the claims of Robbie Earle and Warren Barton. He said: \\u2018Robbie is the best midfield player I've seen since Martin Peters \\u2014 he ghosts into corners and scores \\u2014 while Warren is ambitious and ready to climb mountains.\\u2019 GIBSON: Trains alone ROYLE GUARD Leeds out for revenge OLDHAM boss Joe Royle has warned his players to be ready for a revenge raid when Leeds United cross the Pennines tonight. The Latics were one of only four sides to beat the League champions last season and Royle said: \\u2018They will be going all out to put that right.\\u2019 Leeds are the Premier League's top scorers with 11 and Oldham are just one behind. But with both sides having some shaky defensive displays so far, the Oldham boss predicted: \\u2018It certainly won't be 0-0.\\u2019 Oldham will be unchanged from the side which drew 3-3 against Manchester City as skipper Mike Milligan, who needed three stitches in a mouth wound, has passed himself fit. And he will be one of the players given the job of keeping out the twin threat of Frenchman Eric Cantona and Lee Chapman. Both have scored four goals. ROYLE: Warning Handy LIVERPOOL and Arsenal were among the disappointed clubs yesterday when Andy Awford signed a new contract at Portsmouth. Tyson failed to blunt Razor IAN GIBB NOBODY, but nobody, can stand up and say they gave Mike Tyson a fight twice\\u2026and survived. That's apart from the Razor \\u2014 Donovan Ruddock. Stopped controversially in their first battle, Razor demanded a second go at Tyson. Even if Iron Mike was not quite the same fearsome character as the man who cleaned up all the titles to be the undisputed champion \\u2014 he was still the most feared man in boxing. But the Razor wanted to prove a point and demanded a return. He got it with the cruel bonus of a broken jaw but took Tyson the distance. \\u2018That's Ruddock finished,\\u2019 said the smarties. \\u2018He'll never be the same after two fights with Tyson.\\u2019 Prospect Yet Ruddock, the man with a similar Jamaican-Canadian upbringing to our own Lennox Lewis, proceeded to batter former world champion Greg Page and then knock out big-punching top ten prospect Phil Jackson. Then Ruddock told me: \\u2018Do you really think that after facing Tyson twice, knocking out former world champions Mike Dokes, Page and Bonecrusher Smith I'm really gonna be frightened of Lennox Lewis?\\u2019 He was at ringside to watch Lennox batter Mike Dixon in a warm-up win and played the gentleman by saying: \\u2018I don't need to tell Lennox what I'm going to do.\\u2019 They fought as rookie amateurs, Ruddock taking the decision, but even Razor admitted: \\u2018That won't have anything to do with our next fight. \\u2018I can't wait to get it on.\\u2019 RUDDOCK: Still Razor sharp EYE TV ITV are set to sign a deal with UEFA president Lennart Johansson today for live coverage of the closing stages of this season's European Cup. BREAKER ALLISON Fisher scored a women's record break of 133 last night \\u2014 but she still lost 5-4 to Irish champion Joe Swail at the \\u00a3224,000 Dubai Duty Free Classic. TRAGIC TONY Peterborough 0, Tranmere 0 TRANMERE defender Tony Thomas was carried off with a broken leg after only two minutes of this Anglo-Italian Cup-tie last night. He collided with former Everton youngster Marcus Ebdon. But despite being forced to reshuffle their defence so early, Tranmere held out manfully with goalkeeper-skipper Eric Nixon making a string of fine saves. KICK START DERBY County striker Tommy Johnson is out to break his duck tonight against his former team Notts County. The 21-year-old, who moved from Meadow Lane for \\u00a31.3million in March, hasn't scored this season but sees this Anglo-Italian Cup-tie as his big chance. He said: \\u2018The fact that I have not scored yet spices the match up for me. It would be a great way to start the season off with a goal against my old club.\\u2019 Viv's last fling COLIN PRICE VIV Richards is staying with Glamorgan \\u2014 and has promised the Welshmen one last great season. The former West Indies skipper is currently out of the side because he is short of confidence and form. But chairman Tony Lewis denied last night he had been given the boot. \\u2018Viv will be back here next season,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We have had a chat about what has gone wrong this summer and the upshot is Viv will get himself into real shape by playing more in the West Indies this winter.\\u2019 Richards said: \\u2018Things haven't gone well for me this season because of injuries but I want to stay on here to finish the job. \\u2018When I came I said I wanted to help Glamorgan to become winners and that is still my aim.\\u2019 Former England batsman Bill Athey is leaving Gloucestershire after turning down a new two-year contract. Lager lovers WALES' rugby squad is to get a yearly \\u00a315,000 boost from brewers Heineken as part of a three-year \\u00a33.1million deal to sponsor the Welsh League. WRIGHT ON CHRIS ARMSTRONG, signed from Millwall for \\u00a31.5 million yesterday, will make a sensational debut for Crystal Palace against Manchester United at Old Trafford tonight. Palace boss Steve Coppell says of the striker: \\u2018He can give us the pace Ian Wright used to offer.\\u2019 COPPELL: Swoop CRASH! RONNIE O'Sullivan was beaten for the first time in 25 snooker matches last night \\u2014 Dave Finbow thrashed him 5-0 in the Dubai Classic. Phelan injury shock MARK Hughes and Mike Phelan are both ruled out of Manchester United's team to face Crystal Palace at Old Trafford tonight. Phelan will be out for three weeks with damaged ankle ligaments and Hughes also has an ankle injury. But Hughes is hoping to brush off the knock in time to face League champions Leeds on Sunday. Ukrainian Andrei Kanchelskis returns with Brian McClair forming the strike force with Dion Dublin. Welsh international Clayton Blackmore will take over Phelan's right back spot as United search for their first home win after two successive away victories. United manager Alex Ferguson said: \\u2018It's important for us to get a win in front of our fans.\\u2019 \\u2018We were tighter in defence on Saturday and Mark Hughes and Dion Dublin caused problems. Ryan Giggs was also something special.\\u2019 Indirect line for Graham HARRY HARRIS ARE England going to play direct football? Graham Taylor isn't saying. The England manager, upset by the way his comments were interpreted after the European championship, has gone on record as saying that he is mis-understood, that he cannot shake off the association with the long ball game from his formative years at Watford. Taylor was given the perfect platform to set the record straight at yesterday's press conference. When asked to clarify his intended future playing policy, he said: \\u2018Have a look and see what the team does in Spain, see how it plays and then we'll talk about it.\\u2019 If Taylor believes in the direct style, he should flaunt it. Instead, once again, he has left himself open to more criticism. FIRST LADY CHARLES FAWCUS ANGELIC Antoinette Armes became the first girl to win a race round the Derby track when striking on Incola at Epsom yesterday, but favourite backers did their money before the start. Atlantic Way headed the betting at 2-1 after her win at Brighton last week, but unseated Francis Norton twice in the paddock. Then the filly collided with the rails and lay prostrate on the ground before being re-united with her rider. Owner-trainer John Hill and three racecourse vets checked the filly over and decided she was fit to run, but Atlantic Way could finish only third. Hill later told the stewards that he wouldn't use an apprentice rider again although Norton won on Atlantic Way last week. Incola didn't look a likely winner either when 25 lengths behind pace-setter Great Max rounding Tattenham Corner. \\u2018I didn't think we had any chance of catching him but I just kept shoving and shouting and he got there in the end,\\u2019 said Antoinette. The Isle of Wight born rider's attempt to break into the male dominated racing game has been dogged by injury. \\u2018I've still got a steel plate and screws in my leg after breaking both ankles last year and I had two falls in four days in July. But I'll keep on trying,\\u2019 she said. Another Epsom first came when Japanese Champion Yokio Okabe scored on Shrewd Partner. Hull of a draw! HULL face local rivals Hull KR at the Boulevard in the first round of the John Smiths Yorkshire Cup on Sunday week. Last night's draw: Hull v Hull KR, Bradford Northern v Bramley, Wakefield Trinity v Doncaster, Sheffield Eagles v Halifax, Featherstone Rovers v Dewsbury, Huddersfield v Batley, Leeds v Hunslet, Nottingham City v Keighley. TAYLOR SHOCK HARRY HARRIS GRAHAM Taylor will not be offered a new contract by the FA \\u2014 unless he leads England to a successful World Cup. I can reveal there will be no move to extend Taylor's current four-year deal before England depart for the United States in 1994. And if England fail to qualify \\u2014 the opening tie is against Norway at Wembley in October \\u2014 then Taylor can hardly expect to continue. Taylor faces his FA bosses tomorrow fully aware that his minimum requirement is to ensure that England reach the finals in two years\\u2019 time. Taylor will then need convincing shows in the USA before the FA would give him another four years, equalling the eight-year reign of Bobby Robson. But I believe that Yesterday Taylor named his squad to face Spain next Wednesday. He started a new phase of is management with the same old faces and a stunning whitewash of England's performances in Sweden. He argued that he has to persist with his Euro flops as he tries to qualify for the World Cup. So in come just two new boys, goalscoring wingers David White of Manchester City and Rod Wallace of Leeds. But 14 of the players who shared in the failure in Sweden are retained. Poor Des DES Maea, 22, Oldham's new Rugby League signing, is in danger of losing his sight after a serious road accident. He was hit by a truck as he crossed a road in Auckland. MY JOB-BOB Leeds chase Aussie ace MARTIN RICHARDS LEEDS are all set to clinch their final overseas import \\u2014 Aussie Test forward Bob Lindner. Manager Doug Laughton also showed an interest in Manly's ex-Wigan centre Kevin Iro. But Lindner said yesterday: \\u2018I talked to Doug Laughton this afternoon and he told me a two-year contract was in the mail and everything was fine.\\u2019 Lindner won't be available until after the World Cup final on October 23 because he'll be a key man in the Aussie pack facing Great Britain. He plays for Western Suburbs against Newcastle in Sunday's Winfield Cup play-offs. \\u2018If we get eliminated on Sunday I could have come over straight away. \\u2018But I've told Leeds I would prefer delaying it until after the World Cup final, especially with the Aussies playing three warm-up games in England.\\u2019 New Zealand Test star Iro has not been given a new contract by Manly and was offered back to Wigan last week. But the champions had already filled their overseas quota with Andrew Farrar. Iro has been in poor form for the Sea Eagles and was told several weeks ago that he would have to take a pay cut to stay with the club. Leeds will have to off-load Kiwi utility back Morvin Edwards to make way for Lindner or Iro. Chief executive Alf Davies said: \\u2018We are exploring one or two options but I would hope an announcement will be made in the next 48 hours.\\u2019 IRO: Pay cut DRUGS SHOCK MARTIN RICHARDS GREAT Britain full back Graham Steadman has been fined \\u00a31,000 for failing a drugs test after the last match of this summer's Lions tour. The Castleford star took medicine for a throat and chest infection before the second Test in Auckland. Afterwards he was tested positive in a random check. Steadman, who had been doubtful to play, admitted he was \\u2018naive\\u2019 to take the medicine  without clearing it with the tour doctor. But he stressed that he told officials about it at the post-match drugs test. The RL board of directors accepted Steadman's explanation but said he was \\u2018irresponsible\\u2019 in not checking the contents of the medicine which he bought from a chemist's shop. Castleford officials are angry about the way the case has been handled. Martin Offiah has been fined \\u00a3250 for snubbing the medal ceremony after the Charity Shield. Wigan team-mate Kelvin Skerrett, who did the same, received a severe reprimand. STEADMAN: Failed test CECIL FILLY FACES ARAZI CHRIS JUDGE ALL AT SEA will be supplemented for Sunday's Emirates Prix du Moulin de Longchamp in France as she bids to shake off her bridesmaid's tag. But the Oaks runner-up was far from impressive in her workout on the Limekilns at Newmarket yesterday morning. She was ridden by Pat Eddery over seven furlongs, but it was Willie Ryan's mount Musicale, who came out on top. Trainer Henry Cecil, however, was satisfied enough to let All At Sea take on the likes of Arazi and Ireland's Brief Truce. All At Sea reverts to a mile for the first time this season, having finished runner-up on her last three starts, the best of which was her length defeat by Rodrigo de Triano in the Juddmonte International over a mile and a quarter. Cecil, who had been considering the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot, believes the prevailing soft ground will negate the speed of the specialist milers. French classic winner Culture Vulture was left in the race, but the Paul Cole stable said she will not be ready to run. Ireland's challenge will be led by Brief Truce, who runs for the first time since accounting for both Rodrigo de Triano and Arazi in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Cecil's Derby fifth Twist And Turn should get back to winning ways at York today in the Reference Point Strensall Stakes where Badawai looks the main threat. Dayflower, who goes for next week's May Hill Stakes at Doncaster, was impressive on the gallops yesterday and the step up to a mile is expected to suit her admirably. The stable, who may lose head lad Paddy Rudkin for a training job with Sheikh Mohammed in the Gulf at the end of the season, will also be looking for a new assistant trainer with Simon Bray leaving to gain more experience in America. Daru booked his place for the Cesarewitch at Newmarket on October 17 when completing a hat-trick at York yesterday. Before the big end of season handicap at Newmarket, Daru has a date at Doncaster on Saturday week for the Mallard Handicap. AMRULLAH, racing's best known non-winner, is back in training for another attempt to break his incredible losing sequence which has now reached 74. A decision over retirement has been postponed for the 12-year-old gelding, who resumed road-work last week at trainer John Bridger's Hampshire yard, with a reappearance set for next month. Bridger said yesterday: \\u2018I have had several phone calls during the summer wondering if Amrullah was going to continue racing and he still seems to love the idea of carrying on.\\u2019 SUAVE Dancer was taken out of the betting for the Arc de Triomphe yesterday. Corals offer 2 St Jovite, 4 Pistolet Bleu (from 9-2), 8 Dr Devious, 10 Magic Night, 12 Jolypha, Seattle Rhyme PALACEGATE EPISODE ended her racing for the season on a winning note yesterday. But she had to battle for a York neck victory from Satank and trainer Jack Berry said: \\u2018She ran well, but looked to be going over the top. I do not think Palacegate Episode ran like a 2-5 shot so we will wrap it up for her this season.\\u2019 I'M THE GREAT BRITON Bruno's blaster IAN GIBB FRANK BRUNO last night lashed back at Lennox Lewis: \\u2018The British public will never believe you are one of us until you live here!\\u2019 Lewis lit the touchpaper to their smouldering feud in yesterday's Daily Mirror. He rubbished Bruno's up-and-coming battle with South African Pierre Coetzer at Wembley on October 17, sneering: \\u2018Bruno's next fight doesn't rank in the same league as mine. \\u2018Put it this way\\u2026the fans can go to see a good fight between me and Razor Ruddock at Earls Court on October 31 \\u2014 or they can go to see Bruno win on a cut against Coetzer.\\u2019 Bruno has always stayed clear of any verbal cut and thrust with Lewis \\u2014 until now. And with big fight tickets to sell, Frank isn't going to stand about silently while Lennox knocks his fight. Bruno smashed back: \\u2018How does Lennox expect the British public to have respect for him when he's not even resident in this country? \\u2018He has just come back from Canada and he will go back to Canada.\\u2019 That is presumably via Pennsylvania's Pocono Hills, where Lewis has his training camp for the Ruddock showdown. Lewis, with his trans-Atlantic accent and life-style, is an easy target \\u2014 despite having a house in Bexleyheath and a declared intent to hang onto his British, Commonwealth and European titles. Warmth Bruno was razor sharp himself as he added: \\u2018He is earning money over here and buying houses in Canada. \\u2018If he committed himself to Britain by actually living here he might find a bit more warmth forthcoming from the British public. \\u2018He wouldn't have to put up with people chanting my name at his fights.\\u2019 That was a cutting reference to Lewis's triple title flattening of Londoner Derek Williams, when before the third round knockout punters were growing tired of Lennox's labours and chanted \\u2018Bruno, Bruno.\\u2019 Bruno is no mug and knows that at the very least he is publicising his own fight, and building the grudge content for an eventual show-down with Lewis that could be a \\u00a35million production. BRITISH through and through\\u2026that's big Frank Bruno, whose huge popularity with the sporting public was crowned by the award of an MBE. LENNOX LEWIS is an outsider, insists Bruno FIGHTING TALK: Yesterday's Mirror Sport Mel's on the mend JOHN EDWARDS FAST-RAIDING full-back Mel Sterland is poised to end his six-month injury nightmare. Leeds' former England defender was forced to sit out the final ten matches of last season's title charge with an ankle injury that needed surgery. But last night he signalled he is ready to launch a comeback with the reserves within the next week. And he could even be challenging for a place in the return leg of Leeds' European Cup first round tie against Stuttgart at Elland Road at the end of the month. Sterland announced his return to fitness by saying: \\u2018I am picking up my training steadily and looking to turn out for the reserves in the middle of next week. \\u2018If I come through that without any reaction I'd like to think I'll be in the frame for the return leg with Stuttgart.\\u2019 RICHARD TANNER JAMIE REDKNAPP last night looked on the bright side of Liverpool's worst start to a season since 1954. The 19-year-old insisted: \\u2018We just need a couple of good wins to get us going.\\u2019 Anfield has quickly taken to the midfielder and manager Graeme Souness's decision to replace him with Michael Thomas during Tuesday's match with Southampton was greeted by a chorus of boos. Redknapp added: \\u2018The fans didn't realise I had been nursing a groin strain. But it was nice to know the crowd appreciated my performance.\\u2019 REDKNAPP: Popular WILKO'S TAYLOR-MADE BERNIE LOVETT STRIKER Paul Wilkinson is beating out a message that England boss Graham Taylor may find increasingly difficult to ignore. The Middlesbrough man has hit five goals in as many Premier Division games. It prompted boss Lennie Lawrence to step up his \\u2018Wilko for England\\u2019 call, saying: \\u2018He's at the peak of his form and a threat to any defence.\\u2019 Wilkinson, 27, picked up six Under-21 caps six years ago. But he dropped out of the limelight after moving to Watford from Nottingham Forest. Lawrence has pulled out of a \\u00a3400,000 move for Charlton striker Robert Lee. WILKINSON: Hit TEARS FOR CAROLINE CHARLES FAWCUS QUEEN OF SHANNON had tears and not champagne flowing by winning at Salisbury yesterday \\u2014 but she could not have picked a better moment. For  it's the funeral today of stablegirl Caroline Peat, the horse's regular rider, who was killed in a motor accident last week. \\u2018Caroline looked after Queen Of Shannon as well as riding her at home. She loved this filly and would have been so proud. This win is for her. I just wish she had been here to see it,\\u2019 said trainer Dave Morris. \\u2018Her car was involved in a head on crash with a lorry and the funeral is in Derbyshire,\\u2019 he added. Queen Of Shannon's jockey Michael Tebbutt showed plenty of enterprise when he and John Reid were the only riders to stick to the far rail for most of the race \\u2014 and they finished first and second. Veteran trainer Bill Wightman still keeps an ace or two up his sleeve and struck in some style when Catherineofaragon won by ten lengths under John Williams. Williams followed up on Sheringa for Toby Balding who plans to run Gold Cup hero Cool Ground over the Grand National fences at the revived Aintree fixture in November. Dancing Spirit, who was just behind Catherineofaragon at Newbury, looks a likely televised winner at Kempton today. Willie Carson stands on the brink of his 21st century after reaching 98 on Thawakib, but that's 69 adrift of Michael Roberts who struck twice at York. Takenhall proved the annual star turn, winning the Quintin Gilbey Trophy for the third year running. ANGRY COLUMN PETER SHAW LAMB IS THE HERO SO Allan Lamb's reward for having the courage to speak out and tell the truth about the Pakistani ball-tampering was to be banned for two games and heavily fined \\u2014 with the possibility of further punishment from the TCCB. I am angry and disgusted at the feeble-minded lot at Northants and the petty-minded lot at Lord's. Most of the county players too knew what was going on but kept silent. Lamb's capacity to speak up is the true definition of a man. How small, how shamefaced the ICC must feel now. \\u2014 The ICC feel small? The ICC feel shamefaced? For a sensible chap, you have a fragile grip on reality. Bad form I AM very annoyed about the Pakistani cricket scandal. It is absolutely pathetic the way Allan Lamb is accusing Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of cheating. It makes him look like a racist prat. I'm almost ashamed to be English. What Lamb is saying might be true but I doubt it. Thanks to him and the rest who are behind these outrageous accusations, the Pakistanis' reputations will probably be in tatters. \\u2014 That's two of us, luv. I'm almost ashamed you're English as well. Seams OK WE should encourage all bowlers to raise the seam of the ball. This will help them combat the tactics of the batsmen who these days look more like knights of old with their protective clothing. \\u2014 As you seem to know about knights, how come you haven't heard about chivalry? Al's pal IF I was a rich man, I would pay Allan Lamb's wages. \\u2014 Don't worry. It's the thought that counts. Not cricket WITH all the talk about tampering with cricket balls, I wonder if it might be possible to make the ball from plastic or nylon or some other modern material that couldn't be defaced. After all, football left leather behind long ago, but I expect cricketers will be up in arms about this suggestion. \\u2014 So what if they are? If you want to have curious thoughts, you have \\u2018em. Stu's pots WHO does Stuart Pearce think he is? If it is true he is on \\u00a34,000-a-week and is asking for more, Brian Clough is right \\u2014 as usual\\u2014 to say \\u2018no\\u2019. I would have gone further though. I'd show him the door, tell him if he can get more than that somewhere else he's very welcome and use the \\u00a32million transfer fee on a player who doesn't put money first. \\u2014 What a treasure! Not you, mate, this unique player you know who doesn't put money first. Whine list HERE we go again. At the start of another football season the professional whingers are in full swing \\u2014 Ferguson, Kendall and Souness to name but three. As we have a school of excellence for soccer, why not a school for whingers where they could go in an effort to be cured? I am sure Lennie Lawrence, Steve Gritt and Allan Curbishley would be delighted to take up a teaching post. \\u2014 Waste of time. Once a whinger, always a whinger. Wet wimps WHY is it cricketers never play in the rain? Footballers and all other competitive sports people stay out but cricketers scurry back inside just when it is getting interesting. Is it to stop the rain spoiling their designer hairstyles or is it because they may get damp and catch the sniffles? I think it is stupid and should be stopped. The weather should not win. \\u2014 What you need, sunshine, is more homework if you've time to worry about silly things like that. TV hell YOU don't have to watch a free-kick for a pantomime as suggested in last week's column. Just turn on telly's Central Sport Special. It's the worst sports programme I have ever seen and the first I have ever turned off. My wife was clapping her hands all night. \\u2014 All night! What a braggart. TOP THAT THE Football Writers\\u2019 footballer of the year award started 44 years ago. Mr C. Jones, of Kingswood, Bristol, wins our first \\u00a325 prize by asking you to name the players in that time who have won the award with two different clubs. The second \\u00a325 goes to Miss P. Burnett of Norbury, London. She sent the first correct solution selected and knew that the teams this century who appeared in FA Cup finals and were relegated in the same season were Brighton (1983), Leicester (1969), Manchester City (1926) and Chelsea (1915) EAGLED CRYSTAL Palace are aiming to clinch the \\u00a3850,000 signing of West Ham right-back Tim Breacker in the next week. The cash-strapped Hammers will sell the \\u00a3600,000 signing from Luton in October 1990, as long as the price is right. They may then chase their top target, Charlton's \\u00a3750,000-rated winger Robert Lee. FORTY LOVE PARTY TIME FOR CONNORS NIGEL CLAKE JIMMY CONNORS' 40th birthday bash was a two-hour knees-up in his beloved New York in front of a guest list of 20,000. He won his first round match in the United States Open, putting Flushing Meadow into a party mood as he whipped Brazilian Jaime Oncins 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. Old Jimbo can still roll back the years and reach into his glorious past, and how he loved it as the crowd roared at every winning shot and then sang Happy Birthday as a giant cake was rolled on to court for him afterwards. A star-spangled gallery watched his dramatic win. Actor Richard Harris punched the air when Jimbo made a winner, Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci shouted her support and actress Kim Basinger yelled \\u2018Go Jimmy Go\\u2019. It was fun-time in the Big Apple and Connors admitted: \\u2018I had a great time. That was my kind of deal in front of my kind of people. \\u2018I've had my greatest moments here on my birthday for the last 20 years and I don't intend to stop now. \\u2018I'd have stayed out there four hours if I'd had to. I'd have done anything to win. It was party time for me. \\u2018Jaime must have stood back and thought, \\u2018God, what's going on\\u2019.\\u2019 Connors left the Brazilian shaking his head in disbelief as he hit winners at will and showed the kind of form that rocketed him to the semi-finals last year. Fans hung out banners for their hero, saying \\u2018We love you Jimbo\\u2019 and \\u2018Age rules\\u2019, and the game's greatest entertainer made it a night to remember. He told the crowd: \\u2018It seems like I've been playing here forever \\u2014 and you've been watching me forever. \\u2018I never thought I'd be playing until I was 40. You have given me something I'd never be able to buy.\\u2019 Connors faces old foe Ivan Lendl in the second round today. HAPPY RETURN BIRTHDAY boy Jimmy Connors conducts the crowd in a chorus of \\u2018Happy Birthday\\u2019 after demolishing Jaime Oncins in the first round of the US Open. KO FOR KOP KID! England ace Jones ruled out for six weeks Souness suffers a new blow RICHARD TANNER TROUBLED Liverpool were last night rocked by the news that Rob Jones needs an operation to clear up a persistent shin problem. It will sideline the talented right-back for up to six weeks. And a further blow for the struggling Merseysiders is that key midfielder Michael Thomas won't play for a month after aggravating an ankle injury. Jones, 20, will have to pull out of Graham Taylor's England squad for next Wednesday's friendly in Spain. He missed the European Championship finals in June after suffering pains in both legs, a complaint commonly known as \\u2018shin splints\\u2019. Surgery Jones, a \\u00a3600,000 bargain buy from Crewe last October, hoped that rest over the summer would clear up the problem. But the pains have continued to trouble him and now surgeons feel an operation is the only answer. Jones is likely to undergo surgery over the weekend or early next week \\u2014 and he could miss up to 10 games while he recovers. Thomas will also miss most of those matches after having his right ankle put in plaster to repair ligament damage. It's a desperate double setback for boss Graeme Souness as he tries to halt Liverpool's worst start for 38 years. And Souness' attempt to sell Dean Saunders has hit the rocks with Aston Villa still refusing to pay Liverpool's \\u00a32.3million asking price. The Saunders deal is now off unless Villa chairman Doug Ellis increases his offer. Souness had verbally agreed a \\u00a32.3m deal with Villa boss Ron Atkinson on Tuesday. But Ellis intervened and insists he won't pay more than \\u00a32.1m for the striker. Liverpool, who splashed \\u00a32.9m for Saunders 13 months ago, are equally determined not to lower their asking price. So Saunders will be back in training with Liverpool today with Souness having to decide if the Welsh ace will be in the right frame of mind to face Chelsea tomorrow. Big Ron could now turn his sights on his original target, former Kop star John Aldridge. To complete a bad day, Souness has had an FA warning following remarks he made about referee Stephen Lodge after the goalless draw with Southampton at Anfield last February. CHOKER: Thomas (left) and Jones are both injured OWLS SWOOP FOR WEGERLE JOHN EDWARDS TREVOR Francis wants out-of-favour Blackburn striker Roy Wegerle to solve Sheffield Wednesday's sudden lack of firepower. The Wednesday player-boss contacted Rovers last night in a bid to fill the void left by England marksman David Hirst's month-long injury absence. Francis made his move after seeing his side squander a hatful of chances in their first match since Hirst cracked an ankle bone against Arsenal. Wednesday lost 2-1 at home to Coventry and convinced Francis that he needed a stop-gap replacement for his crocked goal ace. He wasted no time targeting Wegerle as the man to make the most from former England winger Chris Waddle's brilliant prompting. Francis splashed out \\u00a31million to take Wegerle from Luton to QPR when he was player-boss at Loftus Road nearly three years ago. And he's remained an admirer, even though the 28-year-old's \\u00a31million move to Blackburn six months ago has backfired badly. The South African-born striker made little impact and is still out in the cold. Now Dalglish could be ready to sell. Francis initially wants Wegerle on a month's loan but if he is successful it could lead to his third \\u00a31million move. Wednesday striker Nigel Jemson could be on his way back to former club Nottingham Forest. Forest boss Brian Clough has agreed on a swap deal involving Northern Ireland winger Kingsley Black going to Hillsborough plus \\u00a3200,000 cash coming Forest's way. Wednesday offered Jemson to Forest last week but Clough was not interested. But following the sale of Teddy Sheringham to Spurs for \\u00a32.1million Forest are now short of firepower. WEGERLE: Admired COTON STORM MANCHESTER City goalkeeper Tony Coton can expect to be carpeted by the FA following spitting allegations during Tuesday's win at Wimbledon. Police have received complaints from Dons fans about the England B keeper. A spokesman for South Norwood police said they would be sending a report to the FA. COTON: Accused Leeds land Iro MARTIN RICHARDS LEEDS yesterday snapped up giant New Zealand centre Kevin Iro on a two-year contract \\u2014 leaving Australian Test forward Bob Lindner a very unhappy man back in Sydney. Lindner thought he was on his way to Headingley on a similar deal and was expecting a contract to be faxed to him yesterday. But Leeds boss Doug Laughton, knowing that Lindner would not be available until early November because of the World Cup final, switched his attentions to Iro. Leeds hope the Kiwi international will make his debut in the home clash with Hull KR a fortnight on Sunday. New Widnes skipper Paul Hulme leads the side into tonight's First Division clash at Hull KR hailed as \\u2018another Ellery Hanley.\\u2019 Phil Larder, the former Great Britain assistant coach now in charge at Widnes, says: \\u2018Paul has the same leadership qualities as Ellery.\\u2019 IRO: Shock deal DOUG'S DILEMMA KIWI centre Kevin Iro, who is joining Leeds from Manly, didn't do the business in Sydney this year, but the former Wigan ace can probably do a good job against English defences. But after watching St Helens destroy Doug Laughton's men last Sunday, I reckon Leeds need a new front row as well! THIS EXCUSE CUTS NO ICE! ALEX MURPHY MARTIN Offiah has been let off lightly over his Charity Shield loser's medal snub. A fine of \\u00a3250 is hardly going to hurt one of the highest paid players in the sport. The punishment doesn't fit the crime, that's for sure. We've made too many allowances for another top player who thinks he's bigger than the game. I can't buy Offiah's excuse that he needed immediate ice-pack treatment on a leg. A few extra minutes while he went up for his loser's medal wouldn't have made much difference. It can't have pleased the sponsors and the whole affair overshadowed an excellent win by St Helens \\u2014 who are going to push Wigan all the way this season. Offiah said earlier this week that he's a lousy loser but nobody likes to lose \\u2014 he's not unique. But it takes bottle to bury your feelings and accept defeat, no matter what the competition. The Charity Shield might not be the most important trophy but it's still a prestige event and it is used to promote the game. Offiah is fortunate to be blessed with great natural ability and he is certainly the most marketable asset in Rugby League. And with such a high profile, he should set a better example. Sportsmanship might be an old-fashioned concept to many in the modern game but it has to be protected. I'm sure I remember Offiah doing a lap of honour with an ice-pack on his leg after Wigan won the Premiership last season. That was in stark contrast to the previous year in the same competition when he went straight to the dressing-room after Widnes lost to Hull. The Wigan club were embarrassed by Offiah and team-mate Kelvin Skerrett's behaviour at Gateshead. They've a tradition to uphold and the likes of Billy Boston, Eric Ashton and Brian McTigue wouldn't have acted like that. The tragedy is that Offiah did some very good promotional work in Gateshead a couple of days before the game \\u2014 and then blew all the goodwill. He made a wonderful gesture by donating his jersey from this summer's third Test against Australia to the Daily Mirror's special auction in aid of stricken boxer Michael Watson. He refused to swap it with opposite number Willie Carne after the game because he had promised it to the Mirror. That shows he can become one of the game's best ambassadors. MARTIN Offiah has the highest profile in the game and must take the rough with the smooth. SKERRETT: Culprit STRIP SHOW'S A SHOCKER COLIN PRICE ENGLAND rugby fans are getting all shirty over another kit change as Will Carling's men chase a third Grand Slam this winter. For Carling's all-conquering side have worn three different outfits in the last 18 months. First it was the all-white gear with a single red rose on the breast. Then that was changed in a big-money deal with Cotton Traders for a pyjama outfit for the World Cup. And now the one the players have chosen themselves on a split vote is sure to anger the traditionalists. It is predominantly white, but the away strip is even more garish, a mix of red, white and blue. ENGLAND stars Jason Leonard (left) and Dewi Morris show off the new kit with David Pears (middle) in the away strip. SIR Colin Cowdrey has rushed back early from Asia to take personal control of the Pakistan ball-tampering saga. But a cable fault knocked out the phone and fax at his home for two days delaying the arrival of the umpires' report. They won't send over the 2,000 word revelation on what really went on in the referee's room at Lord's, when the Texaco Trophy ball was changed, until BT fix the fault. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU CHRIS LANDER THIS is the letter from TCCB chief Alan Smith that has gone out to every county secretary and effectively gagged England players from supporting Allan Lamb over his ball-doctoring claims. Several Test players have told Mirror Sport they want to publicly get behind their gutsy team-mate, but fear Big Brother is watching closely and ready to get tough if anyone steps out of line. To a man the England team are backing our campaign to flush out the truth. One top player said: \\u2018It's just great the way the Mirror has stuck at prising out exactly what went on in the umpires\\u2019 room when the ball was changed during the lunch interval. \\u2018It's absolute humbug for cricket's administrators not to come clean and tell the cricketing world everything that took place inside Lord's famous pavilion that Sunday.\\u2019 Lamb himself commented: \\u2018I've had England players on the phone telling me what's in the Mirror before I've had time to go out and buy the paper. \\u2018Then they are back on again discussing the latest twists in the whole affair.\\u2019 Another Test star said: \\u2018We've told Lambie he has the support and admiration of all the England squad as well as the backing of every umpire in the country. \\u2018It would be a travesty of sporting justice if he is barred from the winter tour of India and Sri Lanka because he spoke out and told the truth. \\u2018How many times do you punish a man for speaking the truth? That could be on cricket administration's conscience for years to come.\\u2019 SMITH: Letter ESSEX MEN COME FIRST They're out in front again GRAHAM Gooch labelled Essex's latest county championship \\u2018the best of them all\\u2019 after his side clinched the title by beating Hampshire at Chelmsford yesterday. The England captain said: \\u2018We've done it despite a lot of injuries and we've been without Mark Waugh for the last six matches because he's with the Australian team in Sri Lanka. \\u2018Every trophy is nice but perhaps this is our best of all because of the difficulties we've had this summer.\\u2019 Essex guru Keith Fletcher ended a 31-year association with Essex yesterday. WHAT A CORKER THE Essex boys celebrate with champagne on the balcony after clinching the championship at Chelmsford yesterday Mac's smash ALLY McCoist took his Glasgow Rangers goal tally past the 250-mark with a second half hat-trick as the Scottish champions surged to the top with a 4-1 win at Motherwell. The striker, who last season claimed the European Golden Boot award for his 36 league goals, has now claimed 12 in ten games this term. Mac's crunch JOHN McENROE goes into today's US Open showdown with world No.1 Jim Courier insisting: \\u2018This will separate the men from the boys. It will be an unbelievably tough match.\\u2019 But Courier is playing down the fourth-round confrontation at Flushing Meadow, insisting: \\u2018I see it as my next match \\u2014 and every match is a new challenge. \\u2018I'm just going out there to perform well and see what happens. No reason to expend any extra energy worrying about it.\\u2019 Ferrari U-turn FERRARI the fast fading Grand Prix giants, are revving up for a revival\\u2026with British know-how. John Barnard, the world's greatest designer, has been recruited by new team mastermind Harvey Postlethwaite. The cars will be built by a team of 40, only a few of them Italian, and they could be joined by British engine designer Brian Hart for the Italian job to be done in Surrey. DES IN GOAL CRAZY START DES Walker's Italian League career got off to a hair-raising start as Sampdoria drew 3-3 with Lazio. Channel 4 chiefs will have been delighted with the feast they served British viewers. The game had everything \\u2014 two spectacular own goals, brilliant strikes and marvellous individual skills. Walker did an outstanding job to shut out German dangerman Karl Heinz Reidle. But questions will be asked about a defensive unit that could give away three goals. At least he played \\u2014 England colleague David Platt was left out of the Juventus opener, a 0-0 draw at Cagliari. Platt said: \\u2018As the season unfolds, I'm sure I'll get my chances to play and contribute to what looks like being a very successful season.\\u2019 SACRIFICIAL LAMBS! Day 15 of the sensational Lambgate cricket scandal DEXTER'S REVENGE CHRIS LANDER ALLAN LAMB'S sensational \\u2018Daily Mirror\\u2019 revelations about Pakistan ball doctoring will today cost him his place as an England cricketer. Lamb and David Gower will be two famous omissions when chief selector Ted Dexter announces the 16-strong England tour party for India and Sri Lanka. It means Lamb's worst fears will be confirmed as he discovers how his disclosure of the Pakistan ball tampering scandal has totally embarrassed cricket's governing body, the Test and County Cricket Board. Erupted Dexter dropped a heavy enough hint a fortnight ago by failing to back Lamb when the row erupted. After Lamb had blown the whistle on the Pakistanis Dexter seemed to want to wash his hands of anything Lamb was doing \\u2014 suggesting that the Northants captain's forthright comments would not just end with a fine and a suspension from his County bosses. If Lamb's sacking does not come as a major shock then Gower's latest axing is mind-blowingly baffling following his much trumpeted recall for the third Cornhill Test match at Old Trafford. Skipper Graham Gooch and Gower, one of England's true post-war cricketing idols, had buried the hatchet in the wake of one of the game's most public and personalised slanging matches. The elegant Gower had rediscovered his appetite to be both combative and successful in the Test arena and had celebrated his return after nearly 20 months' absence by eclipsing Geoff Boycott's long standing English Test runs aggregate. Gower's form in the last part of the series, when he had an average of 50, should have guaranteed his ticket to India. Yet the selectors are set to perform a mystery U-turn by leaving out their greatest modern day left-hander and most experienced Test cricketer. It is hard to believe that the hiccups over his newly published autobiography can be the real reason behind the decision. True, Gower upset the Indian Cricket Board of Control with sensitive claims about ball scuffing in the last series here two years ago. By the strict and draconian censorship standards of the TCCB it was extraordinary that these allegations were not heavily blue-pencilled. Gower and the TCCB were assured the tour of the subcontinent was in no danger and that he would still receive a cordial welcome in a country where he is admired and respected having beaten Sunil Gavaskar's team there eight years ago. With Lamb and Gower about to be dumped and the mightiest of all rounders Ian Botham unavailable today's Lord's team declaration will mark the sad end of an era for English international cricket. It will be the first time in 15 years that an England tour party has not included one of the celebrated trio, who between them have appeared in 298 Test matches. But if the departure of Botham, Gower and Lamb is a depressing thought, then the international comeback of Mike Gatting and John Emburey must be welcomed. Now an amnesty has been granted reducing their five-year ban to a three-year suspension, they both deserve to play again. But I cannot see any other members of Gatting's controversial South African tour being brought back. Neil Foster of Essex would have made it a year ago after his spectacular haul of 106 wickets and remembering his superb bowling when he produced the performance of his life as the Test bowling hero of Madras under Gower's leadership. But now his injuries have caught up with him, despite a brave battle to recover from recent knee surgery. With no Lamb and no Gower I can see the chance for England's batting enigma Graeme Hick to go on the senior tour, even if he has not been offered a winter retainer contract. Quite amazingly I hear that the selectors are undecided about taking the best wicket keeper Jack Russell \\u2014 and could give Yorkshire's Richard Blakey a first major tour on the grounds that there will be eight one-day international games. This is the tour party I expect to be named this morning: Gooch (captain), Stewart (vice-captain), Smith, Atherton, Fairbrother, Gatting, Hick, Reeve, Russell, Emburey, Tufnell, Lewis, DeFreitas, Malcolm, Cork, Jarvis. MIKE'S SHAME COLIN PRICE BRITISH Lions prop Mike Griffiths last night insisted: \\u2018I'm no villain!\\u2019 Griffiths was sent off in disgrace for kicking an opponent in the head during Cardiff's 15-6 Heineken League win at Aberavon. The 30-year-old forward could now be banned for three months under the \\u2018doubling-up\\u2019 system for getting sent off twice in two years. Griffiths went down in Welsh history as the first person to be sent off for kicking one of his own players. That happened against Pontypridd when video evidence clearly showed his foot came into contact with Stuart Roy. This time he made contact with Aberavon flanker David Edwards in an incident which sparked a mass brawl and will almost certainly rule him out of Wales' international with world champions Australia in November. But Griffiths said: \\u2018I like to play my rugby hard but I'm not a villain. \\u2018It looked a lot worse than it was. He went down on a loose ball and my boot landed on him. People say I kicked him in the head but there is no way I would do that.\\u2019 Cardiff's new Australian coaching organiser Alex Evans hopes to produce video evidence to help reduce Griffiths' sentence. STAMP FURY COLIN PRICE Leicester 11, England 18 ENGLAND manager Geoff Cooke, horrified by violence that marred what should have been a gentle centenary celebration, read the riot act to the players after England's new kids on the block found themselves on the rack at Leicester. His fury was directed mainly at Orrell prop Martin Hynes for starting the madness by stamping on Dean Richards, who had elected to play for Leicester. Hynes was lucky not to see his England prospects totally wrecked by a sending-off. But referee Ed Morrison's leniency led to bad blood spilling over in a six-man brawl as Richards looked for revenge. Now Cooke has to decide whether England B international Hynes is ready for the step-up. \\u2018We must get back to the high standards of self-discipline that we have set ourselves in the past,\\u2019 said Cooke. Inspirational Richards helped Leicester storm back from 18-3 down to 18-11 \\u2014 and they could have snatched victory in the dying stages. England's hero was two-try Nigel Heslop. Record-breaking ful Hold tight! NORTHANTS might just struggle to hold on to the NatWest trophy they won on Sunday. The draw for next season's competition pits the holders against Lancashire in round one and \\u2014 if they survive that hurdle \\u2014 they travel to Essex in the second round. DRAW: First round (June 22): Bucks v Leics, Cheshire v Notts, Devon v Derbys, Glam v Oxon, Gloucs v Herts, Kent v Middx, Norfolk v Warwicks, Northants v Lancs, Scotland v Worcs, Shrops v Somerset, Staffs v Hants, Suffolk v Essex, Surrey v Dorset, Sussex v Wales, Wilts v Durham, Yorks v Ireland. ARAZI SHOCK CHARLES FAWCUS FALLEN star Arazi missed his chance to shine again at Longchamp yesterday, but Henry Cecil got back among the big winners just in time for the St Leger. Arazi was scheduled to try to put his flops in the Kentucky Derby and St James's Palace Stakes behind him in a re-match with the Royal Ascot winner Brief Truce. But trainer Francois Boutin withdrew last year's demon two-year-old after one of the colt's hind legs swelled up. And Boutin still believes that his horse will hit the heights again. Problem \\u2018The problem is not serious and he should be ready to run here at Longchamp in two weeks,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Arazi has been working like his old self and I hope he can go back to America for the Breeders Cup and win like he did last year.\\u2019 Brief Truce was unable to benefit from Arazi's  absence \\u2014 he was beaten a neck by All At Sea, who became Henry Cecil's first Group One winner of the year. \\u2018If the going stays soft she'll go for the Queen Elizabeth at Ascot, otherwise we'll wait for the Champion at Newmarket,\\u2019 said Cecil, who tries to win his fifth St Leger on Saturday with Allegan. But yesterday's race proved another boost for the Doncaster chances of favourite User Friendly, who beat All At Sea in the Oaks. Ruby Tiger beat All At Sea at Goodwood and she was in action across the Atlantic on Saturday night, running second in the Beverly D Stakes at Arlington Park, Chicago. She couldn't hold the challenge of Kostroma in the straight, but second place brought her earnings worldwide to half a million pounds. Outgunned Trainer Paul Cole had also been second in Ireland's big race on Saturday when well-backed Bright Generation was outgunned by Clive Brittain's flying filly Sayyedati at The Curragh. Geoff Lewis was the man on top at Kempton when Silver Wizard ended his run of misfortune in fine style. \\u2018Perhaps people will start to give him the credit he deserves. He's the best I've trained and the best I'm likely to train,\\u2019 declared Geoff. REAPER ROBIN HARRY LLOYD BIG-PUNCHING Robin Reid faces five rivals at Crayford tonight but he won't be landing a glove on them! The Barcelona bronze medallist's dog track debut is part of the Kent circuit's sixth birthday celebrations. Light-middleweight Robin, self-styled The Grim Reaper, is off scratch in the Human Race over the sanded 206metre course. Taking on the Runcorn betting shop cashier is Charlton's Steve Gritt who gets a 20-metre start. Handy The First Division leader's joint manager cannot be ignored from his very handy mark and bookies will almost certainly make him favourite. Water Drip appears a tempting bet for the serious punters in the Birthday Stakes Hurdle although the 540-metre trip will tax his stamina. The Walthamstow jumper was outstayed over the course and distance a month ago but has less to do on this occasion. Back to form Sandy Cottage takes on the classy Lovely Charlott in the 6th Year Marathon. Lovely Charlotte, who has been off-colour, may not be able to hold Sandy Cottage (9.38) over this stamina-sapping distance. Trap one should be the box to follow in Catford's John Humphreys Gold Collar heats. Four red box bankers are Murlens Gift, Mauir Joyful, Skilful Dancer and Slatefield Magic. Murlens Gift (8.32), 8-1 in the sponsor's ante-post list, has a fine chance to regain winning form after an August 21 beating at Sheffield. Locally-trained Mauir Joyful (8.48) was impressive over the shorter course a week ago and is unlikely to be troubled in getting the extra distance. Skilful Dancer (9.04) failed by just a head over the course and distance last time and an improved trap position should do the trick. Gutsy Slatefield Magic (9.55) scorched out of the boxes four days ago and another fast exit will enable her to complete a quick double. Wembley punters will seize on Handsome Henry (9.30) in the Pick Systems Trophy. Powerful Barry Silkman's powerful all-rounder should soon be handily placed and once clear will be difficult to beat. BAGS, the bookmaker company which awards contracts to afternoon tracks on the betting shop service, celebrates its 25th birthday at Hackney tomorrow. Dysert Cheeta (4.37) could give the bookies the birthday blues from an ideal Trap 1 posit- ion. Love-Lee Sunderland 0, Charlton 2 ALAN Curbishley can't understand why Robert Lee is still at Charlton\\u2026but he's delighted he is! Lee, valued at \\u00a3650,000-plus, carved up Sunderland at Roker Park to show just why he's rated in the big-money bracket. Said his co-boss Curbishley: \\u2018I was a bit disappointed when Lennie Lawrence at Middlesbrough didn't come up with the price we'd fixed but I'm happy the lad is still here. \\u2018He's a good player. I can't believe nobody has come in for him. \\u2018But we've sold too cheaply in the past and it won't happen again.\\u2019 Things went Charlton's way against a Sunderland side that had John Kay sent off after 15 minutes and then conceded two bizarre second-half own goals. Kay went for a head-butt on Colin Walsh, who refused to discuss the incident after the match. But Curbishley wasn't so reticent, saying: \\u2018It was obvious. The guy turned round and nutted him.\\u2019 Sub Craig sinks the champs MARTIN RICHARDS Wigan 13, Hull 14 TEENAGE substitute Craig O'Donnell had a day to remember with the try that humbled the champions and brought Hull only their third post-war win at Central Park. The alarm bells were already ringing for Wigan in a  scrappy , error-strewn game, when the 18-year-old O'Donnell, in his only his second senior outing, stepped up for his moment of glory. Scrum-half Rob Nolan chipped ahead, beat Steve Hampson to the ball, and sent the supporting O'Donnell scampering over for a 69th minute try. Paul Eastwood added his third goal of the afternoon before a Hampson try, beautifully laid on by Shaun Edwards four minutes from time, gave Wigan hopes of a last-ditch escape route. But Joe Lydon's touchline kick sailed well wide. The shock result ended Wigan's run of 17 successive championship wins stretching back to last November, but will dramatically lift spirits at the Boulevard. Wigan started the match without top points scorer Frano Botica and five Great Britain tourists. Their problems intensified when wing ace Martin Offiah didn't appear for the second half after picking up a leg injury. And Test prop Kelvin Skerrett had to be replaced six minutes after the break. Eastwood missed two kickable penalties before he got off the mark with a 20th minute kick after Wigan were caught offside. But three minutes later Wigan were ahead. Andy Dannatt lost the ball in the tackle and from the scrum Edwards sent 18-year-old winger Jason Robinson sidestepping through from 30 yards out for a sparkling try. Lydon added the goal and try machine Offiah had the crowd buzzing with his first drop goal in Rugby League \\u2014 a coolly taken effort from 25 yards. A Lydon penalty gave Wigan a 9-2 interval lead and despite the errors, John Monie's men didn't look in imminent danger. But with Wigan using up all their substitutes when Skerrett came off, Hull stepped up the tempo in the second half. Eastwood spilled a chance near the corner before Steve McNamara capped a tremendous spell of Hull pressure when he slipped Gary Nolan over on the last tackle after 54 minutes. Eastwood added the goal and stop gap scrum- half Rob Nolan unlocked the door. Hull yesterday upped their offer to \\u00a3140,000 for Featherstone's tour scrum half Deryck Fox. Tea's party St Helens 24, Wakefield 12 NEARLY 10,000 fans turned out to see St Helens' new Kiwi signing Jarrod McCracken live up to his pre-match billing as the \\u2018new Mal Meninga\\u2019. But it was fellow New Zealander Tea Ropati who led Saints to victory. Stand-in kicker Ropati landed six goals from nine attempts and created a try for Alan Hunte. Trinity held an early 6-4 lead, but were hit with two tries in the final six minutes of the first half as Saints finally clicked into gear. First Bernard Dwyer and Shane Cooper combined to send Kevin Ward crashing over and then Dwyer kicked ahead for Sonny Nickle to win the race and touch down, Ropati landed both conversions to add to a couple of earlier penalties. Saints again struggled to get going in the second half and had to wait until three minutes from time for their final try through Hunte after numerous handling mistakes. Ropati again tagged on the extra points after a penalty success four minutes earlier. Wakefield managed tries through Nigel Bell and David Jones and Peter Benson landed two goals. ROPATI: Goals  DEAN: DON'T BLAME ME! \\u2018I didn't mean to hurt Elliott\\u2019 DEAN SAUNDERS last night pleaded his innocence for the challenge that may have put Paul Elliott out for the season. The Chelsea defender suffered serious ligament damage in his right knee after a sickening first half clash with Liverpool's Aston Villa-bound striker. TV replays showed that Saunders went in with his foot raised and came down on Elliott's leg as they both steamed into a full-blooded 50-50 clash. Saunders admitted: \\u2018It wasn't the best tackle in the world. But there's no way I intentionally tried to hurt him, even though it might look that way. \\u2018The ball was bouncing about and I just went in for it. It's just one of those things. I'm disappointed more than anybody that he went off. \\u2018None of the Chelsea lads said anything to me. I'm just concerned about his injury and I hope he's back as soon as possible.\\u2019 The Chelsea camp, though clearly distressed by Elliott's plight, refused to point the finger at Saunders \\u2014 who was awarded the free-kick by referee John Key. Boss Ian Porterfield said: \\u2018As I saw it, Dean Saunders came down on his leg but whether Paul twisted it as well we don't know. \\u2018These things happen. It's a man's game. We've no complaints but I was surprised the referee gave the free-kick to Liverpool.\\u2019 Unlucky Elliott, 28, knows all about knee injuries. He had two operations to repair torn ligaments in his left knee and was sidelined for 18 months during his spell with Italian club Pisa. Porterfield added: \\u2018It's a big blow \\u2014 far worse than losing the match. \\u2018There has not been a better centre half in the country for the last 18 months.\\u2019 To cap a miserable day for the Londoners, keeper Dave Beasant gifted Liverpool their last-minute winner. Beasant let a Mark Walters cross slip through his hands, leaving Jamie Redknapp a simple tap-in. Beasant said: \\u2018I thought I had it covered but it just crept through my finger-tips.\\u2019 Chelsea looked worthy of at least a point after Mick Harford's 72nd minute goal had cancelled out a first half Saunders header. HOT CHAMP WORLD champion Stephen Hendry was in a hurry in Blackpool yesterday as he took only 58 minutes to reach the fourth round of the \\u00a3140,000 Regal Welsh Open. Hendry beat former English amateur champion Steve Judd 5-0 and in the process fired in breaks of 94, 78, 120, 68 and 97. Former world champion Steve Davis also raced to a 5-0 victory in his match against the Australian John Campbell. ACID TEST FOOTBALLERS could face a three-month suspension \\u2014 for taking ordinary cough mixture! That is just one of the medicines on the FA's new list of banned substances. But many of the Premier Division players claim they know nothing about the current drug-testing programme. THE WONDER OF WHITE JOHN EDWARDS ENGLAND boss Graham Taylor can still call on Gary Lineker's deadly goalscoring instinct \\u2014 by picking David White. The Manchester City marksman is being tipped to win his first cap after surging clear of the pack as the country's top scorer. A two-goal flourish in the 3-0 win at  Sheffield Wednesday lifted his Premier League tally to seven and thrust him into the frame for an England debut in Spain on Wednesday. Peter Reid, City's player-boss, is backing White to fill the retired Lineker's role. Reid said: \\u2018David has exactly the same single-minded attitude as Lineker, and that's why he will score goals at any level.\\u2019 4 OFF FOUR Hereford players were sent off yesterday in their 1-1 draw at Northampton \\u2014 the first time in British history four players from one side have been given the red card. Sheffield referee Brian Coddington, who dismissed three Newcastle players at Derby last season, dished out marching orders to Andy Theodosiou, player-coach Greg Downs, David Titterton and Richard Jones. Theodosiou was the first to go for stamping in the 72nd minute and Greg Downs followed after protesting at a penalty decision. In the final five minutes Titterton and Jones also went after been booked in the first half. Downs and Titterton were interviewed by local police after the game concerning an alleged incident of inciting the crowd. Downs said: \\u2018If I said what I really thought about the ref, they would lock me up and throw away the key.\\u2019 Hereford's Steve Devine said: \\u2018There wasn't one malicious foul.\\u2019 TUC AT BLACKPOOL TERRY PATTINSON \\u2018Change or die\\u2019 unions warned TRADE union bosses warned the TUC to \\u2018change or die\\u2019 yesterday as they unanimously backed a survival drive to recruit more members. Civil and Public Services Association chief Barry Reamsbottom told the unions' Blackpool conference: \\u2018We're stuck in a time-warp and must come in from the cold.\\u2019 And engineers and electricians leader Bill Jordan said the TUC was an \\u2018overburdened packhorse.\\u2019 Recruitment will be aimed at women workers, the self-employed and part-timers. Miners' leader Arthur Scargill's call to defy Tory union laws was rejected. PEARCE BACKS CLOUGH NIGEL CLARKE FOREST'S Stuart Pearce, who leads England against Spain tomorrow night, yesterday claimed: \\u2018Brian Clough is no quitter.\\u2019 With Nottingham Forest bottom of the Premier League, manager Clough is reeling from the club's worst start in his 17 years as boss at the City Ground. There are rumours that he has finally \\u2018shot it\\u2019, that the old managerial magic has gone. But Pearce, says: \\u2018I just can't see him packing it in for a younger man to come in. He won't step down when things get tough. \\u2018He's more likely to walk out when he's at the top, not when he's at the bottom.\\u2019 \\u2018He's still the same Cloughie \\u2014 obviously something has got to be done.\\u2019 Pearce backs Clough PEARCE: Determined to be the top gun when he leads England against Spain tomorrow night. From NIGEL CLARKE  PEARCE: Determined to be the top gun when he leads England against Spain tomorrow night. NOT SO HOT ROD John Edwards ROD WALLACE last night pleaded for the chance to make up for his England heartache, writes John Edwards. The Leeds striker's world fell apart when a hamstring injury cost him his first-ever place in a senior England squad in Spain tomorrow. He said: \\u2018The fear is always there that you won't get back in.\\u2019 WALLACE: Hurt Deane's plea NIGEL CLARKE BRIAN Deane, Sheffield United's star striker, last night asked not to be thought of as just a target man. Deane is most people's choice to play centre forward for England against Spain here to-morrow in a system manager Graham Taylor is almost certain to change. He has been quoted as saying he wants to play long-ball football and that 6ft 2in Deane would come in as his target man. But Deane, who has scored four times this season, says: \\u2018There's more to me than being just that. \\u2018I feel I'll score goals anywhere in any system and not just as a forward player getting on the end of anything knocked long. \\u2018People would be wrong to think of me as just a centre forward who is good in the air. \\u2018I've got pace and I like to take defenders on either wide down the flanks or through the middle. \\u2018It's unfair to have a reputation just because of my size and my build. \\u2018It's always said I'm the perfect man for long- ball football, but I can play anywhere you want me to. \\u2018Maybe if I played with another side I'd get more recognition for what I can do. \\u2018But I've made it with United and now I want the chance to show what I can do at the highest level of all.\\u2019 THEN and NOW FORGET the sangria and San Miguels, England got a slimline tonic when they arrived in Spain yesterday\\u2026in the shape of Paul Gascoigne. Soon after Graham Taylor's boys touched down in Santander for to-morrow night's friendly against Spain, Gazza joined his old team-mates after a 10-hour trip from his new home in Italy. The Lazio star, pictured left carrying a lot of extra poundage on his way to Rome two months ago, has shed more than a stone in weight since his \\u00a35.5million summer move from Tottenham \\u2014 but he must wait a few more weeks before he returns to serious competition. His England pals were last night trying to get him working before he leaves Spain\\u2026as a waiter in Eldorado! Pictures: ALBERT COOPER INCE WAR HARRY HARRIS GRAHAM Taylor had to promise Paul Ince his England debut to persuade him to get off his sick-bed and fly to Spain. The Manchester United midfielder, originally called up for tomorrow's friendly in Santander when Trevor Steven withdrew, was suffering from a virus despite his match-winning performance in Sunday's 2-0 home win over Leeds. Old Trafford boss Alex Ferguson withdrew Ince from the England squad after the game and was about to order his 24-year-old star to have three days\\u2019 rest when there was the sudden turn-around. A telephone call from Taylor's assistant Lawrie McMenemy soon had Ince travelling south, along with United team-mate Gary Pallister, a late replacement for Arsenal's Tony Adams. Ferguson explained: \\u2018Lawrie told me that under a new regulation Ince must join the squad anyway. \\u2018Then he asked me to tell Ince he would definitely be playing in Spain. I put it to Paul and he decided he was prepared to give it a go.\\u2019 Taylor said: \\u2018Lawrie spoke to Alex and as we had lost David Batty we were quite short in mid-field. \\u2018It was right and proper to let Paul know he would be playing.\\u2019 The England boss then gave a breakdown of the dramatic telephone calls made during Sunday. He said: \\u2018At 11.30am we were notified that Tony Adams was out. \\u2018Lawrie immediately contacted Manchester United to make sure Pallister was okay and was told to check again at 6.30pm after the match. \\u2018When Lawrie made the check call he was informed Pallister was coming but that Ince was out on his feet. \\u2018Ince had had an exceptionally good game and Ferguson was told that Ince would be playing in the England side. He said phone back in five minutes. \\u2018When that call was made we were told both players would be coming down and we didn't have to apply any new rules. \\u2018We simply applied rule one, which is what most players are interested in \\u2014 whether or not they are playing.\\u2019 INCE: England debut PUT OUT A HUNGARIAN shot putter last night became the first Paralympic Games competitor to fail a drugs test. Danes Nagy, silver medallist in the event for partially-sighted competitors in Barcelona, was found to have taken metanodianone, an anabolic steroid. Froggy rejects Ireland TONY STENSON ASTON Villa's Steve Froggatt opted for England last night \\u2014 and infuriated Ireland boss Jack Charlton. Charlton has been watching the teenage winger recently but England boss Graham Taylor has handed Froggatt an Under-21 debut in Spain tonight. Charlton said: \\u2018Every time Graham Taylor finds a player with Irish parents, he is after him whether he wants him or not.\\u2019 Froggatt, who has an Irish mother, said: \\u2018I decided to play for England after speaking to my father. But it hasn't pleased my mum!\\u2019 FROGGATT: Chased Duke's treble IAN GIBB DUKE McKenzie came through his comeback at York Hall, Bethnal Green, last night to earn the chance of becoming Britain's first-ever world champion at three difference weights. McKenzie fights WBO super-bantam weight champion Jesse Benavides of Texas at Lewisham Theatre on October 15. McKenzie, the former IBF flyweight champion and ex-WBO bantamweight king, earned something of a hollow victory last night when Birmingham's Peter Buckley was forced to retire with an injured shoulder at the end of the third round. McKENZIE: Winner Trouble brewing NEIL SILVER CRYSTAL Palace chairman Ron Noades led an angry walkout of Premier League clubs as yesterday's sponsorship meeting collapsed. Noades stormed out after eight clubs blocked the proposed \\u00a313million Bass sponsorship deal and six other club  representatives followed him. FA chief Graham Kelly, who was in Spain for England's friendly, will fly home today to deal with the crisis. SPACK'S BACK Nigel rescues his old club Vinny stays FRANK WIECHULA NIGEL SPACKMAN is likely to rejoin Chelsea from Glasgow Rangers today in a \\u00a3500,000 deal \\u2014 but Vinny Jones's \\u00a3700,000 move to Wimbledon has fallen through. Chelsea moved swiftly after Saturday's cruciate knee ligament injury to Paul Elliott, which has robbed them of their defensive kingpin for a year. Rangers and Chelsea agreed a deal last night and Spackman, 31, will travel to London today to complete personal details. But Jones decided to turn down his old Wimbledon club, where he made his name as one of the Crazy Gang. Both Chelsea and Wimbledon agreed the deal, but after a weekend of soul-searching Jones decided to stay and fight for his place. The deal would have taken Jones's transfers to almost \\u00a33 million, spanning four moves with the two London clubs, Leeds and Sheffield United. Jones joined Chelsea for \\u00a3575,000 from Sheffield United just over a year ago and a move to the Dons could be resurrected in the future. Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear said: \\u2018Everything's on ice at the moment. It might be a day or it might be a year.\\u2019 Wimbledon are hoping to sign Crystal Palace striker Stan Collymore for around \\u00a3250,000 and could bring some cash back in by selling forwards Terry Gibson and Paul McGee to Coventry. SPACKMAN: Talks today SAD STAR TONY James, two-try hero of Nottingham Rugby League Club's first win in 18 months on Sunday, has been detained in hospital at Barrow with internal injuries suffered in the first half. James played the second period unaware of the seriousness of his problem. Mel back SHEFFIELD United goalkeeper Mel Rees, on the mend after a stomach operation, has joined Terry Yorath's Welsh squad although he will be out of action for the rest of the season. RICH PICKINGS Row looms over West Indies batting ace Tykes in turmoil JOHN EDWARDS RICHIE Richardson will find himself at the centre of another bitter Yorkshire bust-up tonight. The troubled Tykes meet at Headingley to decide on Sachin Tendulkar's successor as next season's overseas signing. They desperately need a top-class fast bowler and ordered their cricket committee to come up with a suitable candidate. West Indies pair Kenny Benjamin and Anderson Cummins and South Africa's Craig Matthews are believed to have come under scrutiny. But I understand the cricket committee voted 4-1 to nominate West Indies batsman Richardson for a one-year contract to fill the vacancy until Craig McDermott becomes available in 1994. And that will cause uproar tonight when the general committee gather to ratify the decision. Yorkshire TV insist on a household name in return for their \\u00a330,000a-year sponsorship money. But one Yorkshire committee member fumed: \\u2018If you need an engineer you don't go out and get a baker. \\u2018Our urgent need is for a bowler, and that's why we've failed to knock over the final three wickets in an innings on five occasions this season. \\u2018It doesn't matter how good he is. It simply doesn't answer our need and is flying in the face of common sense.\\u2019 RICHARDSON: Cricket committee choice CARLING'S TICKLED PINK Will spreads the gospel MATT HUGHES NOW children that is hardly the way to treat England rugby skipper Will Carling! His leadership is respected by all the rugby nations of the world, but a happy bunch of youngsters from Witham School brought him down to earth as they piled in yesterday at Twickenham. But Will took it lying down \\u2014 all in a good cause of course. He committed himself to helping the future of rugby when he was elected president of a relaunched Young England Club. The England skipper has taken over a club founded by one of his predecessors, Nigel Melville. Carling said: \\u2018Developing the game is vital. This club wants youngsters to choose what we regard as a special game.\\u2019 The organisers of Young England RC are printing 500,000 application forms to be issued to schools and rugby clubs. TWICKERS IN A TWIST WILL Carling is flat out, but the young mixed pack is very much on the ball. Picture: ARNOLD SLATER DION DOWN BUT NOT OUT INJURED Manchester United striker Dion Dublin watches and waits as his team-mates launch a devastating assault on the Premier League's early front runners. The big man has been in a clinic since breaking a leg against Crystal Palace last week and the only way he can join in the Reds rise is by cheering them on in front of his telly. \\u2018I saw the lads beat Leeds on TV and wanted to be out there doing the business,\\u2019 said Dublin. \\u2018It's frustrating but I'll just have to be patient.\\u2019 And he cheered up on hearing he could be back before the six months doctors first predicted. Picture: DENNIS HUSSEY McClair says he's McClear! KEN LAWRENCE BRIAN McClair last night eased Alex Ferguson's worries that the Old Trafford virus had reached epidemic proportions. McClair arrived in Switzerland with the Scottish squad for tomorrow's World Cup qualifying match insisting \\u2018I feel fine,\\u2019 despite fears by his Manchester United manager that he may have ended up in bed at home. Ferguson thought the Scottish striker might be forced to withdraw from the trip to Berne because he feared he had been afflicted by the same illness which has hit more than a dozen of the Old Trafford squad. McClair stressed: \\u2018Funnily enough, I've never felt better after a game this season. \\u2018In fact, it was about the only game in which I've not picked up a knock since the start of the season. \\u2018I did feel a bit ropey earlier in the week and a bug has been going around the club for sometime. \\u2018But it looks as if I've been lucky and escaped the worst of it. McClair stressed: \\u2018I'm sure I will be ready to face the Swiss if selected. I'm feeling good.\\u2019 RACEGOERS will have a chance to back a winner at Britain's next Sunday race meeting and stay within the law. Officials at Cheltenham, which stages the trial fixture on November 15, have agreed to hold sweepstakes on the races. By buying a \\u00a31 ticket, racegoers will be given a number which will correspond to a horse running in a race and, if it wins, they are guaranteed a return of 4-1 whether the horse is odds-on or an outsider. \\u2018After the Doncaster experiment we felt that this was the one element that was missing,\\u2019 explained chief executive Edward Gillespie. The programme, to be televised by BBC, comprises eight races including the \\u00a335,000 Coral-Elite Hurdle, already earmarked as an early season target for Granville Again, Fidway and Flown. There will also be two novelty events, though not the Desert Orchid versus Linford Christie contest that Gillespie had briefly considered. User Friendly was supplemented for Saturday's Coalite St Leger at Doncaster and was among the small band of eight declared yesterday. Clive Brittain's unbeaten filly is now as low as 6-4 favourite and Bonny Scot 11-4 with Corals. JOHN BOTTOMLEY became the first trainer to miss the new official deadline for declaring jockeys yesterday. On the second day of the Jockey Club's OJOCs system, the Malton handler's Swynford Flyer was the only horse to have been declared without a rider at any of today's three meetings. Bottomley had in fact booked Lindsay Charnock to ride his horse at Leicester, but had not informed Weatherbys by the 3.30pm deadline. TAKE GATT \\u2018I'm so sad for David\\u2019 CHRIS LANDER MIKE Gatting last night said David Gower \\u2018will be sorely missed\\u2019 on the England tour to India and Sri Lanka. As Gower's shattering rejection overshadowed Gatting's uneasy wait for his recall, the former England captain said: \\u2018David not being chosen is a very touchy subject. \\u2018I'm very sad he won't be there. He's a very good friend. \\u2018We had a very successful relationship and partnership on the field during the last tour of India eight years ago.\\u2019 Unwise Gatting, back after serving three years of a five-year ban for his part in the rebel tour of South Africa, has unselfishly not forgotten how Gower fought for him to be his understudy in the sub-continent. Gatting added: \\u2018I'd be unwise to say anymore about David Gower at the moment.\\u2019 As for his own comeback to the official international cricket scene, Gatting admitted: \\u2018I'd taken nothing for granted. My name had been bandied about in recent weeks, ever since the ban was reduced by two years. \\u2018Even today I wasn't presuming that I had been chosen.\\u2019 He confessed that he had \\u2018missed playing Test cricket over the past couple of years\\u2019 but had never lost the belief that he would one day play for his country again. He had always banked on being good enough to play another Test match, even if he had been made to serve the full five-year ban. GATTING GUN: Former captain Mike Gatting backs his old mate David Gower GOWER ON ENGLAND I'd have hoped the England team would have been selected on quality and experience but it seems those qualities are not important any more Sacked David won't give up COLIN PRICE A BITTER David Gower blasted England's selectors last night after he was virtually the last to hear he had been tossed back into the cricketing wilderness. The country's greatest scorer has been abandoned by the selectors for the winter tour to India and Sri Lanka and last night he said: \\u2018I would have hoped teams were selected on quality and experience but it seems those qualities are not important any more. \\u2018It's a very sad trend if that is the case.\\u2019 But what hurt Gower more than being rejected for flop Graeme Hick was the way he was told. As England's most capped cricketer, he expected an early telephone call once the team was finalised on Friday. But captain Graham Gooch waited almost 60 hours before phoning with the bad news at 9.30 yesterday morning. \\u2018Graham came up with the news later than expected,\\u2019 Gower said icily. \\u2018I thought the longer it went on, the better it was looking for me.\\u2019 Finished And now Gower is wondering whether the war of words in his and Gooch's summer biographies has finished him off. Gooch blasted Gower's attitude in his book \\u2018Captaincy\\u2019 and described the laid-back left-hander as his biggest failure in management. Gower responded in his book \\u2018Gower\\u2019 by describing the England captain as driven by money and blasted former team manager Micky Stewart's soccer-style approach. As Gower tried to bury the misery of rejection in the preparations for his wedding to Thorrun Nash in Winchester Cathedral in a fortnight, he admitted: \\u2018My words have come back to haunt me.\\u2019 After forcing Gooch to eat his words by winning an England recall this summer and passing Geoff Boycott's Test runs record, Gower had hoped for a late honeymoon in India. Instead he will meet Hampshire officials today to talk about a new two-year contract. And Gower is bitterly disappointed not to have made the tour squad after virtually apologising to the Indian Cricket Board for alleging their bowlers scuffed the ball in the final Test at the Oval two summers ago. Those remarks, like his attack on Stewart and Gooch, were not due to be made public until next week. But his publishers rushed out copies last week and prompted a furore in India. Gower, who averaged 50 in the three Tests he played this summer and 44 throughout his Test career said: \\u2018To say I am disappointed is an understatement. \\u2018I really thought I had done enough after being recalled against Pakistan.\\u2019 Gower was even more stung to learn one of the reasons for his omission was that England play eight one-day internationals on tour. \\u2018Graham talked about the number of one-day games and about not having too many players of over 35,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I had time in the wilderness when my form was not good and that taught me a few lessons. I believed I put them to good use against Pakistan. \\u2018But I shall keep at it. I've come to terms with the blow and I've a marriage to arrange. Nothing will spoil that.\\u2019 GOWER: Tour rejection hurt him THAT'S RICH! RICHIE SIGNING SPARKS STORM COLIN PRICE YORKSHIRE last night signed West Indies skipper Richie Richardson \\u2014 and sent three of their greatest old stars into a rage. Brian Close, Ray Illingworth and Fred Trueman wanted a tearaway fast bowler but were overruled when paymasters Yorkshire TV insisted on the world's number two batsman. The 30-year old Antiguan was recommended by Geoff Boycott, and Headingley legend Trueman blasted: \\u2018It's the same old bloody story. What Boycott wants, Boycott gets. Cricket committee chairman Close didn't even get a vote and threatened to quit as the county plunged towards a new civil war. Former England captain Illingworth snapped: \\u2018The real reason for signing Richardson is because Yorkshire TV are paying his wages. They might as well all resign and hand the club over to the TV bosses.\\u2019 Another committee man said: \\u2018We want an engineer and we've hired a baker. It's crazy.\\u2019 Skipper Martyn Moxon and manager Steve Oldham both wanted a bowler to fill the \\u00a330,000 a year contract. But Sir Lawrence Byford, the club president, insisted: \\u2018We have searched the world at great cost to myself and there just isn't one available.\\u2019 Novice Test fast bowler Kenny Benjamin, rated the best prospect in the West Indies, was just one of the names offered to Yorkshire TV. But they insisted on a player \\u2018of international repute\\u2019. Benjamin had powerful backing in the Yorkshire cricket committee. Close, former England fast bowler Bob Platt and ex-Test spinner Bob Appleyard all wanted him. But Boycott's supporters, who included his fellow former England batsman Phil Sharpe, carried the vote for 63-cap Richardson. Close said: \\u2018This is quite ridiculous. The decision has been made on financial conditions and not to meet the needs of the team. Richardson said: \\u2018I have always wanted to play county cricket and this is a great challenge.\\u2019 Not so rosy RICHIE RICHARDSON had plenty to chew on yesterday after the West Indian's capture by the White Rose county started a row among the big names of Yorkshire cricket NO: Illingworth NO: Close NO: Trueman YES: Boycott SWALES BLASTS TOP DOGS ALEC JOHNSON MANCHESTER City chairman Peter Swales yesterday hit out at the eight Premier League clubs who torpedoed the \\u00a313 million Bass sponsorship deal. The astute soccer  administrator clearly believes there is a serious split which could lead to a \\u2018league within a league.\\u2019 Says Swales: \\u2018They fought pretty dirty. What concerns me is that a group of clubs had clandestine meetings. There was a prearranged cartel. \\u2018It is a dangerous precedent which could lead to a league within a league.\\u2019 Graham Kelly, FA chief executive, yesterday morning abandoned England's team headquarters in Santander to fly to London in a bid to sort out the crisis. SWALES: Split GREAT SCOTT Wilko K0's Kenny JOHN EDWARDS JUBILANT Howard Wilkinson was last night celebrating a transfer triumph over Kenny Dalglish. The moneybags Blackburn boss had demanded \\u00a31.2million for Scott Sellars when the out-of-contract midfielder joined Leeds in July. The champions refused to meet it after selling the 26-year-old to Blackburn for just \\u00a325,000 six years ago. Wilkinson came back with an offer of \\u00a3660,000 \\u2014 and was cock-a-hoop yesterday when a tribunal in Walsall ordered Leeds to pay \\u00a3694,000. The panel listened to both sides for nearly three-and-a-half hours before ruling that Sellars was worth \\u00a3925,000. And with Leeds due 25 per cent of any fee under a clause in the original July, 1986 deal between the clubs, it trimmed their outlay to just over half Blackburn's asking price. Wilkinson headed north with Sellars, managing director Bill Fotherby and secretary Nigel Pleasants and said: \\u2018I'm over the moon with the outcome and delighted with the fairness of the English judicial system.\\u2019 Sellars\\u2019 only problem now is trying to force his way into Wilkinson's star-studded side. Wilko has yet to find even a place on the bench for either of his two big-money summer buys. Record signing Former England under-21 midfielder Sellars, who signed a four-year contract two months ago, and \\u00a32 million record signing David Rocastle have both been left kicking their heels. But the pair will be battling it out with Gordon Strachan and Steve Hodge for the vacancy created by Rod Wallace's three-week injury absence when Aston Villa visit Elland Road on Sunday. IT was hardly a Sellars market as Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson scored brilliantly over Liverpool's Kenny Dalglish to beat down the price for midfielder Scott Sellars WINNER: Wilkinson DISMAYED: Dalglish Paul on the mend NEWCASTLE boss Kevin Keegan yesterday dismissed any fears about the future of Paul Bracewell. The midfielder's career was almost ended by an ankle injury while he was with Everton. Now the same ankle has been put in plaster for 10 days because of tendon trouble, but Keegan insisted: \\u2018It's not too serious and he will be all right.\\u2019 Meanwhile, Keegan revealed yesterday that a \\u00a31million price-tag won't end his interest in Ghent striker Eric Viscaal. \\u2018He's definitely worth another look,\\u2019 said Keegan, whose No 2 Terry McDermott watched the Dutchman in action at the weekend. But Keegan is ready to pull the plug on a \\u00a3500,000 deal for Mechelen's Swedish striker Kennet Andersson. \\u2018It's getting very messy and very  political ,\\u2019 said Keegan, who has set a deadline for the Belgian club. He wants to know by tomorrow if they will allow Andersson to spend a month on loan at Newcastle. BRACEWELL: Injury BATTLE FOR BYRNE SUNDERLAND boss Malcolm Crosby has warned West Ham it will take an \\u2018incredible offer\\u2019 to tempt him to part with striker John Byrne. The Hammers are considering a move for the 31-year-old, but Crosby said: \\u2018I wouldn't consider selling him at the moment.\\u2019 Crosby reassured Byrne yesterday after the Republic of Ireland marksman was forced to pull out of the international squad with a calf injury that will sideline him for a fortnight. Peter Davenport, John Colquhoun and David Rush are all in competition for Byrne's place at Oxford on Saturday. But Crosby won't see them in reserve team action tonight because he's set to be away on scouting business. Byrne was one of the heroes of Sunderland's FA Cup campaign last season, hitting seven goals as the Roker men marched to Wembley. BYRNE: Wanted SKY-HIGH LINDNER MARTIN RICHARDS RUGBY LEAGUE championship leaders Halifax have quashed persistent rumours that they have targeted Aussie Test forward Bob Lindner to help their title push. They admit to having tentative  discussions with Lindner's agent several weeks ago but quickly lost interest in view of the player's sky-high demands. Lindner, who was set to join Leeds until they swooped for Kiwi centre Kevin Iro last week, has claimed he has received an offer from another English First Division club. Halifax secretary David Fleming said: \\u2018Lindner is a terrific player but he was talking telephone numbers. \\u2018As well as a \\u00a350,000 signing-on fee he wanted two cars and a nanny for his kids, plus his contract money. \\u2018We are still in the market for an overseas second rower and utility back to strengthen our squad. \\u2018But we think we have spent our money wisely on new signings up to now and won't be rushed into anything.\\u2019 MARK ASKS FOR HELP MARK Ramprakash believes he needs help to get back to the top after being overlooked for England's two winter tours. The Middlesex batsman, left out of the senior trip to India and the \\u2018A\\u2019 team tour of Australia, has paid the penalty for two bust-ups with his county and a lack of form in Tests. He said: \\u2018I've found it very hard to relax because of the pressures. \\u2018I was so wrapped up in my own performances that I needed someone with experience to help. \\u2018I play hard and to win and that produces frustrations \\u2014 and dealing with those frustrations is what I need help with.\\u2019 RAMPRAKASH: Out Good hiding HERBIE HIDE, Norwich's unbeaten heavyweight prospect, laboured to stop former European champion Jean Chanet after 30 seconds of the seventh round at the Norwich Sports Village last night. The Frenchman's left eye was swollen almost shut from the end of the first round onwards. But Hide could not floor the tough 30-year-old. BOOKIE BASHER CHARLES FAWCUS YORKSHIRE bookies took a caning yesterday on the eve of Doncaster's St Leger meeting \\u2014 and they're threatening not to pay. A betting inquiry has been ordered over Lingfield shocker Jo N Jack, who popped up at 33-1, and BOLA is recommending its members not to settle until investigations are complete. There was little on course money for the horse, but betting shops in Yorkshire were hit by a string of late bets, mostly of \\u00a330 or \\u00a340. Jo N Jack has previously raced in Ireland for trainer/rider Joanna Morgan and is owned by her mother. But yesterday the horse ran from the little known stable of Roger Ingram. The gelding had failed to win over a variety of distances from five furlongs to two miles, but galloped clear in yesterday's mile and a quarter all-weather race under veteran jockey Chris Dwyer. \\u2018I was asked to take two horses from Ireland and this was one of them. We brought him to Lingfield last week and he went so well on the sand, we thought he had a chance today,\\u2019 said the trainer. A GAMBLE on Omidjoy, backed from 66-1 to 14-1 for the opener at Leicester yesterday, failed by the narrowest of margins when odds-on Fair Maid Of Kent got up again to lead on the line. Minutes after appearing before a television crew to defend a jockey's right to have the whip in his armoury, Steve Cauthen was forced to use it aboard the short-head winner. WHY I'VE HAD TO THROW AWAY THAT PHOTO GAZZA  sheds more tears for England I cry each time I see the video\\u2026 \\u2018I thought the memories might help me. They made it worse\\u2019 \\u2018Being with England has made me realise what I have missed\\u2019 NIGEL CLARKE PAUL GASCOIGNE revealed yesterday why he still sheds tears for his beloved England. The man who wept during England's World Cup semi-final with Germany two years ago, now cannot bear to watch himself in the white shirt of his country. And he admits he cries when he sees film of the glory days in Italy when Gazza was ready to become the best footballer in the world. That was before his shattering injury that has taken 16 months off his career. \\u2018I just can't watch myself,\\u2019 he said in Santander yesterday where he has joined up with the England team to watch tonight's match against Spain. \\u2018I have had to throw the videos away. In those dark days when I was recovering from my knee injury I'd play a video of an England match and upset myself all over again. \\u2018I have watched David Platt's last-minute winner in the World Cup match against Belgium, and a big lump came in my throat. \\u2018I thought a few reminiscences might help me. It didn't. Just made it worse. I just wanted to go out and smash a door down. Jokes \\u2018I will  watch the game against Spain because I am not playing. It will be great just to be with the lads again. \\u2018I have missed it all so much. English voices, the general banter, jokes, comradeship and team spirit. \\u2018Yes, I have been lonely. I can't wait for the next get-together, and the thought of pulling on that old white shirt again excites me. \\u2018When I've played a few games for Lazio, when I'm ready and the boss says I am fit to return, I will bring the whole family to Wembley to watch me again. \\u2018I don't think I have much else to prove\\u2026other than that I want to be the best player in the world. \\u2018My knee is fine. There is no doubt in my mind that I can be the player I was before I got injured. \\u2018I don't think about my knee. All I know is that I want to give everything I have for England again.\\u2019 Gazza, now with Lazio of Rome after his \\u00a35.5 million transfer from Tottenham, expects his first match to be against Spurs on September 23. By then he should have fully recovered from the injured right thigh muscle that has delayed his eagerly awaited debut in Italian football. All being well, that should be at home to Genoa the following week. He went on: \\u2018I am fit. I can run around a pitch 25 times, no problem. I don't know what a beer looks like. \\u2018I don't think about what the first tackle is going to be like, unless of course it comes from Stuart Pearce! Or the first twist or turn. \\u2018It will mean so much just to play again. \\u2018I watched the European championship finals on television but I got down again, disappointed because I wasn't there. \\u2018But I kept in touch with Graham Taylor and the boys. \\u2018I involved myself by phoning the hotel to find out from the boss what was going on. \\u2018I knew I would never be fit to play, but I wanted to be part of it still. \\u2018I won't put myself forward for England until I have successfully played for Lazio. That would be wrong.\\u2019 Taylor has already pencilled in Gazza to play his first match for England in the World Cup qualifier against Norway next month. Gazza added: \\u2018Going back to Wembley is very much on my mind.\\u2019 Talent It was there that he was hurt so badly, rupturing knee ligaments in Spurs' FA Cup final win over Nottingham Forest in May last year. He said: \\u2018I will think about the thousands who will be watching and how I want to prove people wrong.\\u2019 There have been many doubts that Gazza couldn't make a come-back at club level or even contemplate straddling the international scene again with the outrageous talent that made him a folk hero. He said: \\u2018I came to Italy for something different. To try something new. \\u2018Of course I still miss the Football League, the chance to get stuck in. You can't do that in Italy without getting booked. \\u2018But I just love football. I like training and enjoy working out twice a day.\\u2019 But Gazza admits he missed Lazio's 3-3 draw with Sampdoria on Sunday that kicked off the Italian season. \\u2018Where were you?\\u2019 he was asked. \\u2018Did you go shopping?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 he grinned. \\u2018I was at home, looking to make babies.\\u2019 Gazza is slowly but surely learning the Italian language, making it work for him. He said: \\u2018There was a dog barking outside my house. It kept on and on. \\u2018I shouted at it in English but it kept on. \\u2018So I went through my phrase-book to search for something like \\u2018Shut up\\u2019. \\u2018I yelled out \\u2018Silencio, bastardo\\u2019. There was immediate silence.\\u2019 The old grin is back on his face. That old confident strut and swagger has returned. He said: \\u2018I am nearly there, so nearly fit, so close. \\u2018It's been a long time and I am not going to rush it. Pleased \\u2018Being with the English lads again has made me realise just what I have been without. \\u2018They were all so pleased to see me. Nobody went on about my injury \\u2014 just asked me how I was getting along in Italy.\\u2019 Gazza cannot wait to be one of them again. And you cannot help keeping your fingers crossed for him. THE ANGUISH OF DEFEAT ENGLAND'S World Cup exit was a sad occasion for Gazza but he's desperately keen to pull on that old white shirt again. GAZZA limbers up with the help of Alan Shearer Pictures: ALBERT COOPER BUSTED MIKE LANGLEY THE Boot Room on Sky stars Andy Gray holding forth like a latter-day Bill Shankly in the tabernacle of Anfield. That windowless cell was where Shanks and his managerial descendants thrashed out every topic. I give Sky's version high marks for content but none for realistic decor. The walls of the actual Boot Room, as I've seen it, have no room for blackboards or instructional pitches because every inch is covered with pin-ups picked for protuberant busts. Come on, Sky. Show it as it is! GRAY: Star host THAT'S OUR BOY True Brit grit MIKE LANGLEY FRANK Bruno jibed this week that Lennox Lewis (Canada via West Ham) isn't one of ours. I've suggested the same myself but, compared to Bob Fitzsimmons, big Lennox is as British as a bacon sandwich. It's 100 years on Sunday since Gentleman Jim Corbett won the first world heavyweight title under Queensberry rules. Fitzsimmons, from the Floral Dance town of Helston in Cornwall, took it off him five years later. The charming Mrs  Fitzsimmons was at the ringside screaming: \\u2018'It 'im in the slats, Bob!\\u2019 Body-puncher Her husband dutifully obliged in Round 14 with the blow he'd practically invented \\u2014 a left deep into the abdomen. The solar plexus punch. Fitzsimmons, a vicious body-puncher, also invented the left hook and was the first to say: \\u2018The bigger they are, the harder they fall.\\u2019 He coined it when matched with \\u2018The Human Freight Train\\u2019, 21stone Ed Dunkhorst. Fitz derailed him in Round One. Fitzsimmons is the only native-born Englishman to win the heavy-weight title, but he'd emigrated to New Zealand as a toddler and fought almost entirely in America. Argument Lewis stuck around in London for five or six years longer than that \\u2014 and he's come home again, which is more than Fitz did. He'll want the facts right if ever qualifying for some later inclusion in \\u2018Champions of the Ring,\\u2019 the life stories of the heavyweight kings that's out this month. Author Gerard Suster, not one to duck an argument, calls Ezzard Charles the most under-rated champ. He says the style of Apollo Creed in \\u2018Rocky\\u2019 was based on Charles, known for his snaky swiftness as the  Cincinnati Cobra. Floyd Patterson's hands, he says, were even faster than Muhammad Ali's. But Patterson was knocked down more times than any heavy-weight champ \\u2014 with Joe Louis in second place. Mike Tyson is ranked: \\u2018Somewhere in the Top Ten but Joe Louis would have done him. He might not have connected solidly with Jack Johnson \\u2014 and his style was made for Muhammad Ali.\\u2019 So, excluding Tyson, who are Suster's best nine? Ali, \\u2018the greatest champion\\u2019, Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sonny Liston, George Foreman and Larry Holmes. But, as he admits, \\u2018Putting them in a proper order is a matter that will never be settled to everyone's satisfaction.\\u2019 * \\u2018Champions of the Ring\\u2019 by Gerard Suster.

ALI: \\u2018Greatest\\u2019 TYSON: Top Ten The decline and fall of a legend MALEEVA KID GUNS DOWN THE GODMOTHER Sad Martina loses heart NIGEL CLARKE THE head went a long time ago, then it was the legs \\u2014 but on Thursday night it was Martina Navratilova's heart that had gone from her game. The Godmother of tennis, who turns 36 next month, lost 6-4, 0-6, 6-3 to 17-year-old Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva in the second round of the US Open at Flushing Meadow. Afterwards she admitted: \\u2018That ranks right up there with the worst losses of my career. \\u2018Time is running out. This could possibly be my last Grand Slam event. \\u2018I just don't know how much I have left in this head, these legs and my heart.\\u2019 Martina, the greatest woman player of all time, has now been beaten by three Maleeva sisters. As well as Magdalena, there's Katerina 23, and Manuela, 25. Navratilova said: \\u2018Thank God Maggie's the last one. I beat her mother, Yulia, but obviously not well enough. She went on to have three daughters.\\u2019 Defeat left Martina tearful, pale and drained and when asked about her future she said: \\u2018Next year? It's pretty hard to think about that when you've just gone out of a Grand Slam event as early as that. \\u2018I don't even know where I will be tomorrow. It's a lot easier to say you'll be back when you are 17 than when you are 35. But I still have no plans to retire. Target \\u2018I was so nervous out there. Why? Do I have to spell it out for you?\\u2019 It was Martina's earliest exit from the US Open since 1976, the year after Magdalena Maleeva was born. She is now a sitting target for any kid new on the block and friends close to her say the defeat has hit her very hard. In 1991 at Wimbledon, it was another pigtailed predator, 15year-old American Jennifer Capriati, who dashed her hopes. Yet Martina believes she is playing her best tennis for six years. She thought she was peaking at just the right time for her battle of the sexes match with Jimmy Connors scheduled for Las Vegas on September 24 with a 500,000 dollar first prize. Yesterday's loss hit her hard and one friend said: \\u2018It's not one that a good night's sleep will make her forget. \\u2018Martina has to give serious thought to whether it is time to review her tennis career. \\u2018When her heart goes out of the game that's it. Maybe it has just happened.\\u2019 MALEEVA: Shock win UPSET A DEJECTED Martina Navratilova walks off court at Flushing Meadow following her shock defeat by Magdalena Maleeva. Afterwards Martina, 36 next month, admitted that it could possibly be her last Grand Slam event. GOOD BOY Hit man's now Saint Jarrod! MARTIN RICHARDS BLOND bombshell Jarrod McCracken has vowed to throw of his \\u2018bad boy\\u2019 tag and help blast St Helens to the championship this season. The strapping Kiwi international centre \\u2014 6ft 3in and 16 stone \\u2014 has been no stranger to Aussie disciplinary chiefs while playing with his Sydney club Canterbury-Bankstown. He was banned for seven weeks after a spear tackle and handed an eight-week suspension for biting. And on top of that McCracken was sent off for fighting in a Test match against Australia. But St Helens have no doubts about his magnificent rugby ability with Canterbury team-mate Terry Lamb describing McCracken last week as the best centre in the world. And Saints hope the Bulldogs will let them keep their prize guy until late February so that he'll be available for the second and third rounds of the Challenge Cup. The 21-year-old McCracken, who makes his debut in tomorrow's home game with Wakefield, said: \\u2018I've come to England with a bit of a reputation but I want to put all that behind me and get on with playing rugby and improving my game. Dream \\u2018I've learned my lesson and changed my ways. That spear tackle cost me my place with the New Zealand team against Great Britain this summer. \\u2018Playing in a Wembley final has always been a dream of mine and I think Saints can get there this season. \\u2018I'm quite excited about playing alongside Gary Connolly in the centre. I watched him on the Lions tour and he's a very good player. I think we can form a very good partnership.\\u2019 Saints coach Mike McClennan enthused: \\u2018With McCracken and Connolly in the centres we'll have something for the ladies and something for the opposition.! \\u2018McCracken is a real mean machine and quite lethal. Saints fans have been honoured to have seen the likes of Tom Van Vollenhoven and Mal Meninga. I think they'll feel the same way about Jarrod. \\u2018He has such awesome power when he hits the line and I think the English game will suit him. We shall certainly be giving him the ball at every opportunity. \\u2018After his enforced lay-offs in Sydney he's raring to go.\\u2019 KIWI CRACKER: Jarrod McCracken boosts St Helens bid Picture: KEVIN FITZPATRICK IT'S NOT OVER YET Italian soccer won't be beyond our Ken Big comeback for TV legend IAN GIBB THEY thought it was all over at the BBC 21 years ago when they switched off the most famous  football commentating voice of all, Kenneth Wolstenholme. But to paraphrase the great man, it's not now! He's back tomorrow on Channel Four to anchor their weekly live coverage of the Italian league, the best club football in the world, and he said: \\u2018This will be much more like the Premier League than what we like to call ours in England.\\u2019 It's beyond our Ken, TV's voice of soccer and it's top commentator through the 50s and 60s, that anyone could prefer the domestic Premier League highlights cobbled together for an hour on BBC's Saturday night Match of the Day. \\u2018There are far more personalities and characters in the Italian game,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018And, of course, our best players like Paul Gascoigne, Des Walker and David Platt are all there.\\u2019 The RAF hero who flew 100 missions over Germany, winning the DFC and bar, believes ratings for the new show will be sky high. He said: \\u2018I think Italian football could well appeal to the ladies. It is so exciting and skilful with many characters. \\u2018We will see top players from the rest of world, Brazilians, Argentinians, Dutch and Germans to enhance the flavour. I'm really looking forward to it.\\u2019 Tomorrow's opener is between Paul Gascoigne's club Lazio and Sampdoria, who have signed England defender Des Walker. And from next week-end, viewers will be able to get a double dose of Wolstenholme. \\u2018That's when we start our preview programme to the big Italian games on the Sunday. That will go out mid-morning on a Saturday, just right for the fans who are getting ready to go to a domestic match,\\u2019 he said. Ken Wolstenholme was never really lost to football after he left the Beeb and he commentated for a time on ITV's Tyne Tees station and recently worked for Tottenham's Clubcall line. Whatever happens in this new Italian season, nobody can ever take away from Kenneth Wolstenholme the most famous football commentary line of them all, delivered in 1966 at the moment England won the World Cup: \\u2018They think it's all over\\u2026it is now.\\u2019 But not for Ken. THEN: Ken Wolstenholme interviewing Joe Fagan and Don Revie (right) NOW: Ken with England great Bobby Moore BARD LUCK!

QPR full-back Bardsley, 28 next Friday, comes into Taylor's England squad as replacement for Liverpool crock Rob Jones. Taylor confirmed: \\u2018Like everyone at QPR he's started the season well and I was impressed with him against Arsenal.\\u2019 BUST-UP! Blank cheques row at \\u2018broke\\u2019 Barnet Flashman accused HARRY HARRIS STAN FLASHMAN'S Third Division Barnet are bust \\u2014 and are in danger of trading despite being \\u2018insolvent\\u2019. That is the extraordinary claim made before the new season started in the resignation letter of managing director Tom Hill sent to Flashman dated June 30, 1992. The Mirror's Special Investigation into the affairs of Barnet have uncovered Hill's shock resignation letter. It informs Flashman of the dire consequences of the club's financial predicament, recommending that the  controversial chairman sells out to a consortium as quickly as possible. Hill concludes that if Flashman refuses to sell: \\u2018The alternatives involving possible legal action against directors and officials of the club and the club itself do not bear thinking about.\\u2019 Hill has informed the Mirror that he has been asked to sign cheques on Flashman's request without any knowledge of who would be the benefactors, or for how much. Hill wrote in his letter to Flashman: \\u2018It would appear that the club is presently trading insolvently. \\u2018This may or may not be the case and I am in no position to establish this, since as you are aware you and Helen have exercised total control both financially and in all other respects without reference to myself or any other director.\\u2019 Helen is the company secretary. She is also Flashman's wife. Hill goes on: \\u2018I also have to state that I am staggered at the amount of money that appears to be owing and am at a loss to understand how such a situation has been reached. \\u2018In any event the system whereby I signed a book full of blank cheques in advance of you writing and issuing them was somewhat of a farce.\\u2019 Flashman threatened legal action yesterday when the Mirror investigation broke the story of a mystery cheque stub. The Football League spokesman said: \\u2018It is our policy not to make any public comment until our investigations have been concluded.\\u2019 But Flashman insisted allegations in the Daily Mirror: \\u2018are totally untrue and are denied\\u2019 and added that: \\u2018Court proceedings are in the course of being instituted.\\u2019 FLASHMAN: Warned of Barnet's dire situation FLASHBACK: Yesterday's Mirror reveals the Barnet scandal Tony's big break MATT HUGHES RUGBY Union rookies Tony Underwood and Martin Hynes received a boost to their England hopes yesterday when they were called up for the today's game against Leicester. The two are among five uncapped England players to face the Tigers as part of the club's centenary celebrations. Hynes is set to replace the injured Jason Leonard at loose-head prop. But while Underwood looks sure to take over from his retired brother, Rory, team manager Geoff Cooke warned: \\u2018We have Chris Oti and Nigel Heslop available and Tony must prove himself.\\u2019 Rory plays for the Tigers. But Cooke has not ruled out a return for the wing legend, who scored a record 35 tries for England. Added Cooke: \\u2018We'll have to see how Rory's RAF career develops \\u2014 he's still playing club rugby.\\u2019 But Tony's sparkling form at England B level is sure to give him the left wing spot and set him up for the Test against Canada on October 17. And with Leonard ruled out of that Wembley clash, Hynes could claim his place today. UNDERWOOD: Call-up HUNGRY PETER NDLOVU, Coventry's 19-year-old Zimbabwean international striker, is banking on scoring up to 15 goals this season to send his value rocketing. He scored his first goal of the season on Wednesday \\u2014 and Ndlovu, who is rated by Coventry manager Bobby Gould as \\u2018the most exciting young striker I have ever worked with\\u2019, believes that's the first of many. Ndlovu is already a national hero in Zimbabwe after becoming their youngest ever international at the age of 15. Durie's Sheri party SPURS star Gordon Durie hopes to carry on today where he left off with new striking partner Teddy Sheringham. They both scored against Sheffield United in midweek in Tottenham's first win of the season. But Durie picked up a knee injury and faces a late fitness test before today's game against Everton. Coach Doug Livermore is keen to keep the \\u00a34 million partnership going. He said: \\u2018They've struck it off and look a great combination.\\u2019 Spurs have called reserve team striker John Hendry into the squad, plus Nicky Barmby, who was called up to the England Under-21 squad this week. Paul Allen takes over as captain in the absence of suspended defender Neil Ruddock who is likely to be replaced by David Tuttle. Gary Mabbutt, last season's skipper, plays his first full game after three summer operations in a friendly against West Ham this morning. Spurs are trying to get their Coca Cola League Cup tie with Brentford brought forward two days so they can send a strong team to play a friendly in Rome on September 23 against Paul Gascoigne's Lazio. DURIE: Fitness test Kevin loses Swede NEWCASTLE boss Kevin Keegan is caught in a \\u00a3500,000 tug-of-war over Swedish import Kennet Andersson. The Mechelen striker, who is owned by his club president and leased out to the Belgian team, was on his way home last night after less than a week on Tyneside. And although a three-man Newcastle delegation will watch Andersson against Ghent tonight, boss Keegan fears club politics are hampering his assessment of the player. He said: \\u2018The lad is torn politically because while their president is happy to let us have him on trial, the trainer wants him back for matches. \\u2018It's an unfair situation. We are expecting him back on Monday \\u2014 but if he's only staying for three days it's a pointless exercise. We want him for a month on loan to give him a proper chance.\\u2019 Keegan takes a 17-man squad to Bristol Rovers as his high-fliers bid to justify new promotion odds of 3-1 after winning their last six League games. Fit-again central defender Brian Kilcline, key midfielder Paul Bracewell and new full-back John Beresford are all in the running to play. KEEGAN: Unfair ROKER ALERT OVER CROOK Crosby has new target \\u00a31m swap on cards MATT HUGHES SUNDERLAND boss Malcolm Crosby yesterday opened the door to a swap deal that would bring Norwich schemer Ian Crook to Roker Park in exchange for Gordon Armstrong. High-flying Norwich had a \\u00a31 million approach for Armstrong turned down last year. But the Canaries are likely to have more success if they throw 29-year-old Crook into the equation. Crosby said: \\u2018I have not spoken to Norwich but I would be interested in Crook. \\u2018He's a good player and he fits the bill.\\u2019 Check The Roker manager had planned to watch the former Spurs midfielder in action last week, but ran a check instead on Sheffield Wednesday's Danny Wilson. But Crosby's move for Wilson has been put on ice while Southampton dither over whether to come back in for Armstrong after having a \\u00a3750,000 bid rejected. It's a complicated situation that leaves Armstrong in limbo \\u2014 and almost certainly back on the bench for today's visit by table-toppers Charlton. Crosby said: \\u2018I can't fault Gordon's attitude. I've kept him informed and he has just to get on with his job. \\u2018I've got to be patient with players in the side but I can't afford to be patient for too long.\\u2019 Sunderland are unbeaten in four games but have scored only one League goal at a time when rivals Newcastle have been hogging the limelight. Crosby said: \\u2018If I worry about what's happening up the road, I'll lose track of what we are doing here. \\u2018We are not doing that badly.\\u2019 SWOOP: IAN CROOK fits the bill at Roker Park STAND BY YOUR LAMB NOW LET'S HEAR IT FOR HIM AT LORD'S TODAY MIKE LANGLEY A MIGHTY blow for honesty can be struck today at Lord's \\u2014 nothing is required beyond the crowd rising as one for Allan Lamb. I'm not proposing a massed demo. The headquarters of cricket isn't the place for howling mobs with banners. I'm not calling, either, for sporadic barracking or bricks through the Long Room windows. The great day of a NatWest Trophy final is certainly not the time for that. But a serious point can be made with dignity by thousands of spectators simply standing to applaud Lamb when, as the toss dictates, he either leads Northants down the pavilion steps or walks out to face the Leicestershire attack. Those fans today should not waste their opportunity to show the ICC, the TCCB, the MCC \\u2014 and all other initials conveying infirmity \\u2014 exactly what the public think of official evasiveness. Pakistan doctored the ball in the Texaco Trophy at Lord's, but the authorities admit nothing. Every particle of evidence remains under lock and key. The umpires' statement, the match referee's ruling, even the allegedly mistreated ball itself \\u2014 although I wouldn't be surprised to hear it's disappeared in a burglary! We'd know nothing of that damaged ball but for outspoken Allan Lamb. He defied suspension under a gagging contract imposed by the counties on their cricketers \\u2014 but which, I feel, the players should have refused to sign. They'd been duped into believing the gag (nothing may be published without sanction from Lord's) protected them. But wouldn't cricket have been better served by frankness from the outset and an early investigation of suspicions concerning Pakistan? My postbag is the proof that a season's secrecy \\u2014 until Lamb forced some overdue action \\u2014 has exposed professional cricket to the public as a game prepared to condone or cover-up cheating. A game that shrugs its shoulders while figuratively dropping Exhibits A to Z down the nearest grid. A game where the Test and County Cricket Board yearns for powers that would allow Allan Lamb to be hung in chains as a warning to all whistleblowers. The TCCB meet two weeks' after today's final to decide on what further punishment can be meted out to Lamb on top of a two-match ban and threat of expulsion from the England dressing-room. I say they shouldn't get away with that. I say you fans at Lord's can shame the TCCB into a re-think. So let's it hear it this morning for Allan Lamb. Stand up and be counted for fair play and truth! Eu are not to blame says Watson IAN GIBB MICHAEL Watson has recovered enough from brain surgery to tell conqueror Chris Eubank: \\u2018It was my own fault.\\u2019 Watson, who hovered near death and needed two brain operations after his  twelfth -round collapse in a WBO super-middleweight title fight at Tottenham a year ago this month, is even talking about a comeback! Of course, it won't happen. Islington's brave battler can still barely talk above a  whisper . But he is making a remarkable recovery. In an interview published by Boxing News he said: \\u2018I've told Eubank to bring the Belt he owes me. \\u2018He says I'm the champ and I told him to tell everyone. I'd fight him again. \\u2018Next time I would keep my hands up \\u2014 it was my own fault. I've seen the fight many times on video.\\u2019 Watson, for whom The Mirror helped raise \\u00a3150,000 in a special appeal night in July, is being cared for in an East London neurological rehabilitation unit, added: \\u2018I am here until next March \\u2014 it's driving me crazy because I want to make a comeback. There's nobody out there to beat me.\\u2019 WATSON: Interview YOUNG FERGIE IS SENT OFF KEN LAWRENCE Switzerland 2, Scotland 0 MANCHESTER UNITED star Darren Ferguson was sent off in disgrace as Scotland were beaten in this European Under-21 championship qualifier at Sursee last night. Ferguson, son of United boss Alex, went for two bookable offences in a stormy game that saw three dismissals. The young midfielder was booked for a foul on Jean Karlen in the 28th minute. And when he clashed with Mario Cantaluppi in the 65th minute he was sent packing. The Swiss player also got his marching orders and team-mate Raphael Comisetti went two minutes later for a lunge at Darren Salton. The young Scots crashed to a surprise defeat through goals from Sven Christ and sub Marcel Meier. Ferguson became the first player to be sent off in the six-year reign of Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh. But Under-21 boss Craig Brown said: \\u2018I felt Darren was unfortunate, but he made it easy for the official by a slight push. \\u2018I'm not exonerating him but a lot of refs would have maybe done it differently.\\u2019 I'M SORRY Come back Nigel Young Cloughie backs the boss HARRY HARRIS GRAHAM TAYLOR yesterday turned for salvation to Nigel Clough, the Nottingham Forest star who declared England had no chance of winning the next World Cup. Only three weeks ago Clough launched a scathing attack on the way he was treated at the European championship finals in Sweden this summer and voiced his disapproval at manager Taylor's long-ball style. But Taylor was in a forgiving mood here in Santander when Clough was named in a new-look attack for tonight's friendly against Spain. Clough had written in a newspaper column: \\u2018If England are switching to kick-and-rush football, you can count me out. So-called direct tactics wouldn't be good enough to beat the best teams at international level. \\u2018I've only ever known one way to play the game, and that is to pass the ball on the floor. Impact \\u2018The long-ball game is no good to me and it won't enable England to succeed in the 1994 World Cup in America.\\u2019 Clough was embarrassed by the newspaper article and clearly sorry over the impact of his remarks. But last night he insisted he had no grudge against Taylor, even though in his column he openly discussed his innermost anguish at being one of only three England players not to kick a ball during finals. Clough wrote: \\u2018I felt angry, frustrated, disappointed, useless and unused for a whole week. \\u2018It was the most frustrating time of my life sitting on the bench and watching our hopes blow up in smoke. \\u2018Graham Taylor was trying to get us through to the semi-finals in the best way he knows \\u2014 rightly or wrongly. \\u2018I don't believe for one minute I'd have been the saviour, but I'd have loved the chance to make a contribution in my country's hour of need. I I Turn to Page 26 U From Back Page might even have got us a goal.\\u2019 Now red-faced Clough wins his eighth cap, saying sorry and backing Taylor. \\u2018I am happy to do any job for Graham Taylor, and it's nice to have the likes of Peter Beardsley praising my ability and fighting my corner,\\u2019 he said. Taylor added: \\u2018Nigel will be asked to play as he does for his club, his normal game. \\u2018Okay, he didn't play in Sweden but who's to say he wouldn't have done had we got to the final? \\u2018When I took over in 1990, Nigel only had one cap and I wasn't absolutely convinced that he would be an integral part of the team. \\u2018Now I am looking for Nigel to produce his club form. I am not saying anything about the short or long-ball game, only what is right at the proper time. \\u2018We are looking to get the ball to Alan Shearer, David White and Andy Sinton.\\u2019 Clough is excited at the prospect of linking up with free-scoring forwards like Shearer and White. He had a close look at Shearer in Saturday's match at Blackburn, and added: \\u2018He's the sort of player that makes you want to get the ball to him as many times as possible. \\u2018Now I just want to fit in and become a member of a successful side.\\u2019 GAME FOR A LAUGH! Clough and Gazza during training in Spain Picture: ALBERT COOPER THREE weeks ago Clough blasted England's tactics WHITE: Goal ace STEVE CAUTHEN was happy to hear that a Jockey Club working party is being set up to look into use of the whip. \\u2018It's something that should have been done a long time ago. It's as difficult for the stewards as it is for us,\\u2019 he said. LOCHSONG IN RECORD BID CHARLES FAWCUS LOCHSONG clicked again at Doncaster yesterday and now she's attempting the impossible. No horse in history has landed the Stewards Cup, Portland Handicap and Ayr Gold Cup treble, but Lochsong is off to Scotland next week with the first two in the bag. Ian Balding's filly is 7-1 favourite for Ayr with sponsors Ladbrokes, but jockey Willie Carson knows she has a job on. \\u2018She's tough and game and the ground at Ayr should suit her better than this,\\u2019 said Willie after Lochsong had just held on to take the Portland. \\u2018But she gets a 7lb penalty next week and will the soft ground be enough to wipe that out,\\u2019 queried Willie who has reached his 21st century on Tuesday. Carson has to be at Newbury on Cup Day and Balding may well use apprentice Francis Arrowsmith. Venture Capitalist almost caught Lochsong yesterday and her trainer Richard Hannon is only too happy to take Lochsong on again in Scotland. \\u2018We didn't get the run of this race,\\u2019 said Richard who went on to win the next with Notley. Difference \\u2018Blinkers did the job for him. He's been a bit disappointing and they made the difference.\\u2019 The Kerry Group Irish Champion Stakes lost one of its biggest draws yesterday when Rodrigo de Triano was not entered for the Group One race at Leopardstown on Sunday. Find us a star COLIN PRICE BRIAN CLOSE was last night challenged to find Yorkshire a proven world class fast bowler. As cricket chairman Close raged on about the decision to sign West Indies batsman Richie Richardson instead of a genuine quickie he was told: \\u2018You find one and we'll sign him. They are just not about.\\u2019  Beleaguered chief executive Chris Hassall said: \\u2018The two we talked to \\u2014 Ken Benjamin and Anthony Cummins \\u2014 have only just come onto the scene and they are very inexperienced in real international cricket. \\u2018It was felt they didn't really measure up. Everyone here accepts we need a bowler, the problem is there is no-one of sufficient stature. \\u2018We didn't want to be another Surrey, where Rudi Bryson has been a disaster.\\u2019 But Close, who is considering whether to resign in protest, insisted: \\u2018There are two tours this winter by the West Indies. What if Benjamin and Cummins make names for themselves and become world class by next summer. \\u2018They might be available \\u2014 but someone else will sign them. \\u2018We know Richardson is a fine batsman but the real need is for a fast bowler.\\u2019 Man in the middle RICHIE Richardson is one of the world's great batsmen, but Brian Close believes Yorkshire's need is for a top strike bowler and not the West Indies captain Foxy move MARTIN RICHARDS BRADFORD Northern finally snared Deryck Fox at the fourth attempt yesterday \\u2014 helped by three local businessmen and 200 fans digging into their own pockets. The 27-year-old Great Britain rugby league star joined Northern from Featherstone Rovers for \\u00a3140,000, a record for a scrum half. And after watching Fox initial a three-year contract, Northern chairman Chris Caisley commented: \\u2018It's been the most difficult job I've had since being here, both financially and having to deal with Featherstone.\\u2019 Fox turned down a move to Hull at the weekend but Northern had to match the Humbersiders' \\u00a3140,000 offer before clinching the deal. They had originally offered \\u00a3100,000 for Fox, who asked relegated Rovers for a move just before he left on the Lions tour Down Under in May. \\u2018This has been a success story for Bradford supporters,\\u2019 added Caisley. \\u2018Two hundred fans have contributed in one shape or another with people coming with a fiver in the hope it would help. Featherstone will now use a slice of the Fox cash to recruit an Aussie scrum half. Great Britain tour skipper Garry Schofield will head back to Australia next summer to play for Manly on a \\u00a350,000 short-term contract. He will team up with Widnes star John Devereux who agreed a short-term deal with Manly coach Graham Lowe last week. Schofield and Devereux are expected to fill the centre roles left by Michael O'Connor who has retired, and Kevin Iro, who joins Leeds next week. DERYCK FOX celebrates his switch to Bradford BRIAN CLOSE ON THE BIG YORKSHIRE BUST-UP \\u2018I've been stitched up by the Richardson gang\\u2019 JOHN EDWARDS BRIAN CLOSE I WAS ready to turn my back on Yorkshire and end an association stretching back 40-odd years over the decision to sign Richie Richardson. As I made my way home and tried to comprehend the logic of taking another batsman on board, I kept arriving at the same conclusion \\u2014 that I'd be better off out of it. I could see no just cause for carrying on after arguing vehemently against the idea, then seeing it carried. As cricket chairman, I was left to carry the can for a move that made no sense and was none of my doing. And I wasn't prepared to go along with that. There was only one thing for it, and that was to sever a connection that \\u2014 save for a seven-year stint with Somerset in the 70s \\u2014 goes back to 1949. The president, Sir Lawrence Byford, talked me out of it yesterday by imploring me to stay and fight my corner rather than walk away. Heavy I saw sense and decided I wouldn't take my bat home after all. But I did it with a heavy heart, I can tell you. I'm still absolutely disgusted at what has happened, but the emotion is one of sadness and bitter regret rather than anger. Seeing that ruling railroaded through made it the saddest day of my life. I was ready to chuck it all in after a decision that flew in the face of reason. For starters, we only decided to break down the barriers and go for overseas imports last year because we needed an out-and-out fast bowler to make any impact on the championship. Batsman Sachin Tendulkar was engaged this summer simply because Craig McDermott pulled out with an injury at the last minute. The lad has done a lot for the club out in the middle and in the dressing room, but hasn't answered our prime need \\u2014 someone to knock over the opposition. Now we've signed up Richardson, who may be the world's number two batsman but will do no more than Tendulkar to sharpen our cutting edge. And I'm haunted by the fear that we're going to pay a hefty price for ignoring the claims of Kenny Benjamin and Anderson Cummins. The detractors say they are relative newcomers who would have constituted a gamble. Host But try selling that argument to the counties who took on Mike Procter, Malcolm Marshall, Courtney Walsh, Waqar Younis, Allan Donald and a host of others who arrived as untried prospects. Sir Richard Hadlee is another who was nowhere near his knighthood as Test cricket's leading wicket-taker when Notts first tossed him the new ball. They have all blossomed into world-class talents, and their counties have prospered with them. We could have done the same with Benjamin. I want to make it clear that the cricket committee did not put forward Richardson's name unanimously, as some have suggested. Bob Platt and I pressed for a bowler as fiercely as we could, but to no avail. The club went for another batsman instead, and that's why I was intent on resigning. But I won't. REJECTED: Kenny Benjamin was Close's choice GEM: Hampshire's Malcolm Marshall GEM: Courtney Walsh GEM: Waqar Younis GEM: Richard Hadlee Disaster for Davis FORMER world snooker champion Steve Davis was dumped from the Dubai Duty Free Classic in Blackpool yesterday by Wayne Jones. After losing 5-2, Davis said: \\u2018I've no complaints but this was best forgotten. It's an occupational hazard.\\u2019 Welshman Jones, 33, took a 3-0 lead and never looked in any danger after that. Another loser was world number five Neal Foulds, who crashed 5-3 to Accrington's 143rd-ranked Shokat Ali. Salisbury shows 'em LEG spinner Ian Salisbury, left out of the England tour squad for India, sent Lancashire crashing to one of the worst championship defeats in their history in the last Old Trafford match of the season against Sussex. They were humiliated with a day and a half to spare by an innings and 182 runs \\u2014 just 18 runs less than their record loss against Yorkshire in 1938. Salisbury followed a career-best six for 29 in the first innings with five for 54 in the second for match figures of 11 for 83. Webb gets chop MATT HUGHES THE man who masterminded Derby County's escape from bankruptcy was yesterday shown the red card by the club. Stuart Webb, who has been secretary, chairman and managing director during 21 years at Derby was unanimously voted out as associate director after constant conflict with the board. His position as a member of the Football League Management Committee could also be under threat. Webb was one of the key figures in the restructuring of the Football League following the breakaway of the Premier League. Webb's finest hour came in 1984 when, with Derby just days away from going out of business with debts of \\u00a31.5 million, he promoted himself from managing director to chairman. He then persuaded the late Robert Maxwell to join the board. Webb is currently out of the country on business and neither Rams' chairman, Brian Fearn or owner and vice-chairman Lionel Pickering, would comment on the matter. Daley's knee op ASTON VILLA winger Tony Daley yesterday had an exploratory operation to assess knee ligament damage and is out for a month. But manager Ron Atkinson is hoping to complete the \\u00a32.25million signing of Liverpool striker Dean Saunders in time for Sunday's televised game at Leeds \\u2014 just 24 hours before Cyrille Regis goes into hospital for an Achilles tendon injury. Atkinson is also giving a trial to Canadian striker Alex Bunbury. Mardon nightmare PAUL Mardon, Birmingham City's \\u00a31 million rated central defender, has suffered a setback in his bid to clinch a dream move to Liverpool. Mardon, who began a week's trial at Anfield on Monday, suffered an ankle ligament injury during training which will sideline him for two weeks. He said: \\u2018It's the second time I've suffered this sort of problem. There was nothing said about the transfer. All I can do is try and get back in the side.\\u2019 Last season Mardon's hopes of joining Liverpool were also hit by injury. RECORD BREAKERS Colin hits lucky 13th DAVID MOORE N Ireland 3, Albania 0 RECORD-BREAKER Colin Clarke set Northern Ireland off on a World Cup romp in Belfast last night. Portsmouth striker Clarke fired his way into the history books with his 13th goal for the Irish to finally beat the all-time best of 12, which he previously shared with Gerry Armstrong, Joe Bambrick and Billy Gillespie. And Clarke admitted: \\u2018It's a weight off my mind. I've been waiting for four or five games, so it's a bit of a relief.\\u2019 Kevin Wilson and Jim Magilton also hit the target in the first half, after the Albanians had started this Group Three qualifier with a bang. Following the disappointment of April's 2-2 home draw with unfancied Lithuania, when the Irish surrendered a 2-0 lead, this victory will put some colour back into the cheeks of Billy Bingham's boys. The boss must now drive his troops on towards tough games against Spain and reigning European champions Denmark at Windsor Park during the next two months. Bingham's new-look outfit, with Mal Donaghy pushed into a holding midfield role, and Kingsley Black dropped after a run of 22 caps, finished well in control against the Albanians. But their nerves were twitching early on as Albania cut loose with fast, lively football. Irish keeper Tommy Wright did well to shove over a fierce shot fired in by Altin Reaklli after just 30 seconds. Then Wright grabbed Ilir Kepa's header, watched Eduard Abazi's drive clear the bar and later blocked another blast by Kepa. But the game changed character dramatically in the 14th minute, when Clarke's breakthrough dampened Albania's spirit. Attack partner Iain Dowie battled through two tackles on the edge of the penalty box, before the ball broke kindly for Clarke to sweep his shot wide of visiting keeper Foto Strakosha. Goal number two arrived in the 29th minute. Kevin Wilson was given space by Clarke's precise header to beat Strakosha with a low cross shot. And he set up the third, after 44 minutes, with a 20-yard effort that Strakosha could only shove out. Magilton then seized his chance, collecting the rebound to score from close range. CLARKE'S CRACKER: Northern Ireland's Colin Clarke blasts the first goal of the game \\u2014 and his record 13th for the team. ROYALS SEE RED HUGH JAMIESON WBA 3, Reading 0 READING had four players booked and defender Phil Parkinson sent off against Second Division leaders West Bromwich. Scott Taylor, Jeff Hopkins, Parkinson and Kevin Dillon all had their names taken before Parkinson got his marching orders for a foul on Bob Taylor. Unbeaten Albion scored through Simon Garner, Taylor and Craig Shakespeare. United bonus MANCHESTER United's Ryan Giggs, Dennis Irwin, Clayton Blackmore and Darren Ferguson have all lost their \\u2018foreign\\u2019 tag. They will now be classed by UEFA as \\u2018assimilated\\u2019\\u2014 and United can choose two of them in their squad to face Russian side Moscow Torpedo in the UEFA Cup first round clash later this month. GOUGH OFF KEN LAWRENCE SWITZERLAND 3 SCOTLAND 1 SKIPPER Richard Gough was sent off as Scotland's World Cup hopes were hammered by a late Swiss surge at the Wankdorf Stadium last night. It was a disastrous night for Andy Roxburgh's men, despite the fact that they went in at half-time all square at 1-1. Gough got his marching orders from Dutch referee Mario Van Der Ende when he caught the ball during a devastating Swiss assault. The day had started in farce when keeper Andy Goram somehow lost his passport on Scotland's team coach. Only hurried negotiations between the Scots and the British Embassy produced the necessary clearance papers in time for the keeper to play. And within two minutes of this Group One clash, Goram must have been wishing his accreditation hadn't come through. Swiss midfielder Alain Sutter was allowed to run hard at the Scottish rearguard, forcing Gough to concede a corner. Sutter took the kick himself and Adrian Knup rose unchallenged to head down and past the stranded Goram. But Ally McCoist put the Scots back in the game when he hit his 13th international goal in the 13th minute. Gordon Durie stole down the right and seeing the defences lack of organisation, he blasted in a low pass which McCoist drove home first time. But then Knup grabbed back the lead in the 72nd minute and ten minutes later, Georges Bregy thundered home a 30-yard free-kick. And as Switzerland began to run riot, Gough was sent off in the 84th minute for handling the ball as Knup threatened to break through again. Knup rocker SWISS forward Adrian Knup rises unmarked over the Scottish defence to head the opening goal. ADIOS TAYLOR! The DAILY MIRROR SPEAKS ITS MIND \\u2026and this is the picture the whole nation wants to see WAVING GOODBYE AND THAT GOES FOR BIG LAWRIE NEIL SILVER Steve Clarke, Chelsea's Scottish international defender, had a hernia operation yesterday and will be out of action for five weeks. WHY HE'S GOT TO GO NO flair NO goals \\u2018Taylor is public enemy No1\\u2019 HARRY HARRIS SPAIN 1 ENGLAND 0 GRAHAM TAYLOR has now used 54 players in his two-year reign \\u2014 and the England manager is still no nearer to formulating a team. There is no belief, no conviction, no flair, no inventiveness and, with no goals in Santander, no hope. The case for Taylor to vacate his position has been strengthened by the pain here in Spain of a shabby England performance after the torment and failure in the European championship finals. To avoid any more personal suffering I say he should contemplate going now to give his successor the chance to build a proper team to qualify for the World Cup finals. Taylor has turned into public enemy number one. Two years ago he was clearly the right man for the job \\u2014 now few would support that motion. Taylor suffered only his third defeat in 25 games, but each reverse has been harder to take. First it was defeat against the Germans at Wembley to end a 12game unbeaten run. Next it was against the Swedes when it really counted in the European championship. There were debuts for Paul Ince, David White and David Bardsley last night and there are sure to be even more changes for the opening World Cup qualifying tie against Norway at Wembley on October 14. Setback The Football Association are sure to be unswayed by this set-back, as they were by the failure to score in the opening European championship games against Denmark and France and then by the defeat by Sweden. But by the time Taylor approaches the return tie with Norway on June 2, England's participation in the World Cup finals in 1994 is sure to be virtually decided one way or the other. That gives Taylor just seven World Cup ties to rescue his own precarious position or accept that the only solution is an honourable resignation. Taylor boldly announced that he would begin his second phase as England manager with an adventurous, attacking, entertaining team. That has rebounded. Alan Shearer wore the number ten shirt with high hopes of scoring the goals in the first international since the retirement of Gary Lineker. But Shearer suffered the same lack of service in Taylor's new-look team as Lineker had in Sweden. Nigel Clough was instructed to link in attack with Shearer. But that was abandoned midway through the second half. White switched from the flank to partner Shearer in attack, but it wasn't long before Taylor tried a third attacking combination. Brian Deane took the place of White while Paul Merson came on for Andy Sinton. Whichever formation Taylor deployed the result was the same \\u2014 absolutely nothing! Clough's only moment of inspiration came after just two minutes when he superbly threaded through a pass to utilise the blistering acceleration of White. White burst clear, but his shot cannoned off the legs of the experienced Barcelona keeper Zubizaretta. Once again Taylor was afflicted by the right back curse. QPR's right back Bardsley came on for Arsenal's Lee Dixon at the start of the second half, but lasted only 19 minutes before limping off. Carlton Palmer, who cannot get into the Sheffield Wednesday side, came on, with Ince switching to right back. Palmer almost rescued England. His cross, just one minute after coming on as substitute, caught Zubizaretta floundering on the ground \\u2014 but White's shot was blocked. Taylor had earlier witnessed the worst piece of defensive football that Des Walker has produced in 48 appearances. Walker played a sloppy square-pass, selling his centre-back partner Mark Wright short and costing England a 12th-minute goal. Liverpool captain Wright lunged into a tackle but the ball bounced off the legs of Spain's masterful midfield star Martin Vasquez. The player that Terry Venables would have loved to lure to Spurs unleashed a shot that struck the heels of Fonseca and fell kindly for Fonseca to shoot past Chris Woods. Orders TAYLOR lays the law down to Nigel Clough, but it didn't work. USELESS! CHARLES FAWCUS DONCASTER'S ST LEGER will turn into a farce tomorrow if the weather forecast is wrong. Clerk of Course John Sanderson is banking on rain to save the race's face and ensure that favourite User Friendly lines up. \\u2018The forecast is for rain and I'm not going to water the track,\\u2019 said John to the dismay of User Friendly's trainer Clive Brittain and jockey George Duffield. \\u2018Her owner Bill Gredley was persuaded to pay \\u00a325,000 to enter her because the going was to be good. It hasn't been good all week and that's not fair,\\u2019 said George. And Brittain declared: \\u2018She won't run if the ground stays as it is. She hated the fast ground at York and she's too good to abuse. They should put some water on at least.\\u2019 Two track records fell yesterday and the official going was changed to good to firm. But early punters were betting on the idea of good going and well-backed Sovereign Rock just could not handle the faster conditions. Sanderson stuck to his guns: \\u2018I am trying to do what's best for the meeting. If I water and then it rains it will go soft just like that with false patches.\\u2019 Hold-up KINGSLEY Black's \\u00a3 1.2m move to Sheffield Wednesday from Nottingham Forest is off until after the weekend. The deal, which also takes Nigel Jemson back to Forest, was agreed but neither club wants to complete the move before the two teams clash tomorrow. BLACK: Wait RED EYES! HUGH JAMIESON LIVERPOOL are on the trail of Steve Lilwall, table-topping West Brom's rookie left back, writes Hugh Jamieson. Manager Graeme Souness has already watched the 22-year-old, and Liverpool were again represented at West Brom's match against Reading on Wednesday night. Lilwall said: \\u2018Obviously I am delighted and flattered, but at the moment I am just concentrating on playing for West Brom. If anything does happen then I am sure our manager, Ossie Ardiles, will tell me.\\u2019 Brummie boy Lilwall was signed from GM Vauxhall club Kidderminster in the summer for \\u00a330,000 with another \\u00a330,000 due when he completes 30 senior games. SOUNESS: Interested Swede nothing KENNET Andersson's dream of playing for Newcastle United lay in ruins last night. The Swedish international striker's proposed \\u00a3500,000 move from Belgian club Mechelen fell through after Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan failed to agree the fee. Meanwhile, United's John Beresford returns against his former club Portsmouth tomorrow after missing four games through injury. LET ME GO! PACKIE BONNER is angry that Glasgow Celtic boss Liam Brady would not let him go on loan to Premier Division club Middlesbrough. The transfer-listed Republic of Ireland goalkeeper is desperate for first team football, especially as the Republic face tough away World Cup assignments against Denmark and Spain. Bonner said: \\u2018Nothing has changed at Celtic. I want to leave the club. I need first team football and I'm disappointed that the loan period to Middlesbrough did not materialise.\\u2019 Brady turned down the loan deal \\u2014 Boro keeper Steve Pears was injured \\u2014 because he says he needs Bonner as cover for Gordon Marshall in next week's UEFA Cup tie with Cologne. BONNER: Disappointed No go Tony TONY AGANA last night walked away from a chance to rejoin Sheffield United on loan \\u2014 and end his Notts County nightmare. Blades boss Dave Bassett, whose team haven't scored for three games, wanted to reunite Agana with England striker Brian Deane. But County's record \\u00a3750,000 signing decided to stay at Meadow Lane, where he has scored only once since moving last November. The 28-year-old striker was recently fined and transfer-listed by County boss Neil Warnock after showing his displeasure at being substituted. But Bassett said: \\u2018Tony explained that he doesn't want to go anywhere on loan.\\u2019 AGANA: Deal off That's the Way Paul putts the past behind him ONY STENSON PAUL WAY, former golden boy of British golf, is lucky to be alive, kicking and just three shots adrift of Ian Palmer in the \\u00a3600,000 GA European Open at Sunningdale. Way suffered a bizarre, life-threatening accident just nine days ago. Fortunately he managed to duck out of the way of a lump of glass as it speared towards his neck. He said: \\u2018I'm lucky not to be paralysed and to have escaped with just a busted nose.\\u2019 Way, his face still cut and bruised, put his nightmare behind him yesterday at Sunningdale to resurrect his once glittering career. But the man the players were all looking over their shoulders at was British Open champion Nick Faldo. He rattled up three birdies on the final holes, to move into Palmer's shadow with a four under-par 67. Even so, the day belonged to Way, who, after two Ryder Cup appearances, got lost on his way to the top. Way, watching Faldo's charge, told about his horror story which began on the eve of the Swiss Open. He tried to use the top of a door frame to stretch his aching back. He said: \\u2018But the whole thing collapsed on me. \\u2018I landed on a lump of wood, felt another crash on to my face and was just getting up when a huge piece of glass fell where my neck had been. I'm lucky to be alive.\\u2019 Way was forced to quit the Swiss Open and missed out on a chance to claw his way back into the Ryder Cup reckoning. He said: \\u2018I'm desperate to regain a Cup place, and that made the whole episode even worse.\\u2019 Way lifted his battered body from the treatment table to finish just three shots behind South African pace-setter Palmer, who stroked a glorious seven-under par 63. Palmer was one shot ahead of Robert Karlsson, one of the new wave of scintillating Swedes, England's Mark James and Kiwi Frank Nobilo. Faldo's back nine of 31 was the best of the day. He finished with a fabulous flourish \\u2014 three birdies in a row. Then he admitted: \\u2018It's nice to be back at work.\\u2019 NICK: Hat-trick BOSS MAN Vinny puts his shirt on it Jones heads for top NEIL SILVER VINNY JONES went back to Wimbledon yesterday and declared: \\u2018I've taken the first step on the managerial ladder.\\u2019 Jones admitted he was still baffled by his sudden \\u00a3700,000 exit from Chelsea, but is now looking forward to learning all about management from Dons boss Joe Kinnear. After signing a four-year contract Jones, 27, said: \\u2018I see this as my apprenticeship towards management and supremo Sam Hammam told me to come back and look forward to that. \\u2018That's in the future but it will be another chapter in the book and I am sure Joe is going to point a few things out to me and help me along the way. \\u2018When I finish playing football I'll probably be coaching and be one of those still playing in Wimbledon's reserves at 40. That's the sort of club it is, you've got to muck in and do everything.\\u2019 Kinnear, who said he expected to make one more signing this week-end, looked forward to Jones the manager with a wry smile. He said: \\u2018All I know is that we've signed him on a playing contract for four years and we're delighted to have him back. \\u2018Whenever Vinny is around there is always excitement. He has come back a wiser player and he will add drive to the team.\\u2019 Jones, who makes his debut at Ipswich tomorrow, revealed the agonising details of a transfer he never wanted to happen. \\u2018I don't know what the reasons are because there has been nothing said to me,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018A decision was made, they had to raise money and that was it. \\u2018It came out of the blue. I first heard about it after the game at Liverpool last Saturday and I stormed in and said I don't want to get away. \\u2018I tried to stay but they said they were paying my contract up and I had no option. They made it impossible for me to stay. \\u2018I was gutted because I had a superb time at Chelsea. \\u2018But that disappointment has gone and now I've got to look forward to my time at Wimbledon. I can already feel the old excitement coming back. It's not the Crazy Gang any more but maybe we'll find a new name.\\u2019 Jones, who started his professional career at Wimbledon before moving on to Leeds, Sheffield United and then Chelsea, said he had returned a better player. \\u2018I have played alongside internationals wherever I have been, so of course I am a better player,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018But I am not coming back crash, bang wallop. I will see how the club has changed and then ease my way in.\\u2019 VINNY Jones nailed his colours to the wall yesterday as he swapped his Chelsea shirt for a Wimbledon one. Pictures: ARNOLD SLATER LINK-UP: John Fashanu and Vinny Jones are back together again at Wimbledon. No lolly Loughlin ST HELENS are taking legal advice after the Rugby League turned down their compensation plea for injured Test centre Paul Loughlin. Loughlin, out until Christmas, broke his arm playing for Great Britain against New South Wales Country, and Saints have been told that insurance does not cover players on international duty. Nabbed by telly WIDNES scrum half Bobby Goulding was last night banned for two matches for attempting to butt Castleford's Mick Ford in a League game on August 30. The incident was highlighted on Sky TV and spotted by the club's committee when they watched a video of the clash between John Devereux and Keith England in the same match which resulted in both men being sent off and banned for two games. ONE IN THE EYE FOR SKY ALEX MURPHY /MARTIN RICHARDS BOBBY GOULDING is no saint \\u2014 but I'm glad the disciplinary committee only gave him two matches last night after his trial by TV. Don't get me wrong, I don't condone what he did in the Widnes-Castleford game. And the committee could have come down on him like a ton of bricks. But they obviously felt they couldn't make too much of an example of him because a lot of people, mainly on Sky TV, had already judged the issue. It's grossly unfair for television to single out one player from one game and conduct a kangaroo court there and then. Sky TV's broadcast put the whole incident in the public eye, even though Goulding was formally cited after the  Disciplinary Committee watched a tape of the game last Thursday when dealing with two men sent off in that match. Unfair The referee didn't see the Goulding incident and he wasn't reported. Widnes bitterly complained about the unfairness of the situation saying \\u2014 quite rightly \\u2014 that if incidents like that are to be pulled out you would need 26 cameras \\u2014 for every player. There were 16 other games going on that day and there could have been a score of bad incidents missed by the referee. But the cameras were only at one game and Goulding was the sacrificial \\u2018bad boy\\u2019. After he was pulled out of the tour following a four-match ban and then seeing Wakefield's Michael Jackson make the trip after picking up a similar suspension, Goulding probably feels there's a vendetta against him. If you do it for one you do it for everybody. And to prevent the game being faced with another can of worms, the system of picking out illegal or violent play must be done through proper channels \\u2014 not after a TV judge and jury have sat. Club It would mean videos of very game being studied by a panel of experts, not connected to any club, before a player is cited. The four or five men on the panel would have square eyeballs ploughing through all the tapes but that's the only real way forward if we are going to be fair in all this. Clubs don't like citing other clubs\\u2019 players for the ill-feeling it can cause. And TV cameras homing in on incidents referees have missed can only make the officials feel a little incompetent. BOBBY Goulding didn't deserve to be judged by TV says Alex Murphy. OZ RULES ALEX MURPHY /MARTIN RICHARDS HUDDERSFIELD have an electronic scoreboard at Leeds Road \\u2014 and it could blow a fuse when the Aussies play us next month! Australia are calling it a warm-up game for before the World Cup but I just hope they feel a little heat from my boys. And I reckon it would be a good idea to include two or three Great Britain Under-21 players to add a competitive edge. But it's still a great bonus for the people of Huddersfield, Sheffield and Workington to be able to see great players like Mal Meninga, Laurie Daley, Bradley Clyde and Andrew Ettinghausen. Champs roar on ESSEX put the seal on another glorious season with one of the most famous victories in their history against Derbyshire at Derby yesterday. Set a massive 440 after being dismissed for a paltry 96 in their first innings, the champions showed their pedigree by reaching the target with four wickets to spare. England captain Graham Gooch was again the hero with a magnificent unbeaten 123, the 98th ton of his career. Wicketkeeper Mike Garnham scored a fighting 66 in a sixth-wicket stand of 129 with Gooch. Colin's dream chance KEN LAWRENCE COLIN Hendry's international dream could come true next month. Blackburn Rovers' Scottish defender, who has only one B cap to his name, has already been pencilled in as replacement for Richard Gough who was sent off in Switzerland this week. Andy Roxburgh will check on Hendry before the World Cup qualifier with Portugal and is poised to bring him in for a match Scotland must now win. Gough, the first Scotland captain to be sent off, faces a one-match ban after his automatic dismissal for handling during the disastrous defeat in Berne. Scotland international coach Roxburgh admitted: \\u2018The loss of Richard presents us with a real problem. \\u2018We are a bit thin on the ground for central defenders and we're going to have to look around a bit. \\u2018Not only have we lost a centre-half, we have also lost the leadership of Gough \\u2014 his absence is a big blow.\\u2019 Only two weeks ago, Hendry sent a plea to Roxburgh asking for his chance at the highest level. And the Blackburn star insisted: \\u2018Now I am playing under Kenny Dalglish I feel my chances of finally achieving my ambition of playing for Scotland must be enhanced. \\u2018All I want is the opportunity, then it's up to me. If I'm not good enough I'll be the first to admit it.\\u2019 Hendry is also noted for making dangerous raids on opposition boxes \\u2014 just like Gough. Cheats warned COLIN PRICE NEW England rugby president Danie Serfontein has told cheating clubs making illegal payments: \\u2018Cut it out or else.\\u2019 His warning follows another close-season merry-go-round of players changing clubs amid rumours of big-money payments. Serfontein said: \\u2018Illegal payments are widespread. We have heard cases of players being offered \\u00a35,000 to change clubs.  Unfortunately we have never been able to get the evidence.\\u2019 SCANDAL Talking at the launch of the Rothmans Rugby Union Yearbook, Serfontein added: \\u2018We will take sanctions against clubs if we can pin them down.\\u2019 Officials could increase next season's four-month qualification period for players changing clubs to one season in a bid to stamp out the scandal. HARRY HARRIS GRAHAM TAYLOR yesterday vowed not to quit as England manager \\u2014 but admitted he feels as hounded on the back pages as the Royal Family are on the front. Despite calls for his head, Taylor yesterday pledged to stay on until his contract expires after the World Cup in 1994. However, I believe that if England falter seriously in their next seven games \\u2014 all World Cup ties \\u2014 and look like failing to qualify, then Taylor will consider the honourable move of resigning. But for the moment Taylor isn't running scared of the barrage of hostile headlines. He has certainly not been tempted to consider his position ahead of next month's first qualifier against Norway. And he has no intention of resigning now. Taylor said: \\u2018It is pointless asking that, because I am not going to do it. I don't think it would serve any purpose.\\u2019 \\u2018It's not a question of whether I feel I'm the best man for the job. I was appointed and I've got the job.\\u2019 FLASHBACK: Yesterday's Mirror Sport GRIM REAPER'S REVENGE MATT HUGHES THE \\u2018Grim Reaper\\u2019 of ice hockey explained the role he has at Wembley Arena today: \\u2018I go out and do a job on anyone who is giving our top scorers a hard time.\\u2019 Stu Grimson, 6ft 5 1/2ins and 220lbs, provides the steel for Chicago Blackhawks when they clash with Montreal Canadiens in a \\u2018war on ice\\u2019 for a \\u00a320,000 prize and the Molson Challenge Cup. England football team agent Jon Smith has organised this latest attempt to popularise the sport in the UK. But angry British Ice Hockey chief David Pickles said: \\u2018We don't need the National Hockey League here.\\u2019 GRIMSON: Hit-man KRABBE KO THE German Athletics Federation has recommended a four-year ban on double world sprint champion Katrin Krabbe for failing a drugs test. They recommended that a similar ban be imposed on two of Krabbe's team-mates \\u2014 world 400 metres silver medallist Grit Breuer, and Manuela Derr, a member of East Germany's gold-medal winning 4x400 metres relay team at the 1990 European Championships. BULL'S RED RAG DAVID MOORE STEVE BULL faces a roasting from angry Leicester fans when he spearheads the Wolves attack at Filbert Street tomorrow. City fans are still livid over the clash with Bull that led to skipper Steve Walsh's sending off in the 3-0 defeat at Molineux three weeks ago. The bad feeling goes back further than that \\u2014 because the England striker was himself red-carded after a bust-up involving Walsh at Leicester two seasons ago. With Walsh under suspension, the unenviable job of marking Bull has been handed to Simon Grayson. And the 22-year-old is under strict orders from manager Brian Little to lay off the physical stuff. Says the Leicester boss: \\u2018Bully loves it when there's plenty of rough and tumble. He absolutely thrives on body contact because he's so powerful. \\u2018The answer is to stand off and let him play in front of you, rather than wrestling his way round the back.\\u2019 And Little added: \\u2018We've lost only twice this season \\u2014 against Wolves and at Southend last week-end. \\u2018In both cases we had a player sent off and conceded a penalty. If that doesn't signal a message about how we should approach Sunday's match, I don't know what will.\\u2019 Paul Mardon's hopes of clinching a dream \\u00a31 million move from Birmingham City to Liverpool have been dealt a major blow after he was told that he needs surgery on an ankle ligament injury. KEV'S GOLD RUN NIGEL CLARKE KEVIN Campbell, Arsenal's goal-greedy hit man, plans to overshadow team mate Ian Wright and Blackburn's Alan Shearer in the race to provide England with the next generation of strike stars. Campbell, Wright and Shearer will show off their talents at Highbury today, as Arsenal bid to gun down Rovers\\u2019 unbeaten record. It was Campbell who replaced the injured Wright in the England squad in Spain this week. And he says: \\u2018I got in only because Ian was hurt, but I have to put sentiment aside and think of Kevin Campbell.\\u2019 Shearer is in to stay, but while Taylor deliberates just who should be his partner up front Campbell plans to gate crash the party. Adds Campbell: \\u2018There are some good strikers around, and I don't know if the England manager has ever had such a choice.\\u2019 Whelan comes clean YOUNG Ipswich defender Phil Whelan pleaded last night: \\u2018Don't call me dirty.\\u2019 The 20-year-old, who has picked up three Premier League bookings already this season, also sprang to the defence of the game's most notorious tough guy Vinny Jones. The pair clash at Portman Road today as Jones returns to Wimbledon following his \\u00a3700,000 move from Chelsea. Whelan said: \\u2018I've never played against Vinny before and I am looking forward to it. \\u2018We won at Wimbledon last month and Vinny might be just what they need to gee them up.\\u2019 The 6ft 4in newcomer is concerned at his own disciplinary record, which took another jolt when he received a yellow card on his Under-21 debut. He admitted: \\u2018Lawrie McMenemy took me off at half- time in Spain after I'd been booked. He did it for my own good. \\u2018I am going to have to watch my step. But I am more clumsy than dirty.\\u2019 FLECK FLAK Rob aims to gun down old pals Blues are better bet FRANK WIECHULA ROBERT FLECK aims to gun down table-topping old boys Norwich today insisting: \\u2018Chelsea are a better bet for trophies.\\u2019 The Scottish international striker left Carrow Road last month in a \\u00a32.1 million-deal after a string of goals and a blaze of publicity. Ironically, City now head the Premier League whilst Fleck has scored just once in six games for mid-table Blues. But the 27-year-old firmly believes he's done the right thing. \\u2018I think Chelsea offers me the greater chance of winning something than if I'd stayed at Carrow Road. \\u2018Chelsea are a big club and have got big support. \\u2018I was used to that at Glasgow Rangers. I stepped down in going to Norwich even though the supporters were good. \\u2018The time was right before the season started for us to part company and I've never regretted it and neither have Norwich. \\u2018Hopefully we can go out and beat them, it'd be great to burst their bubble.\\u2019 Fleck was kept out of the first meeting between the two sides at Carrow Road \\u2014 when Chelsea went down 2-1. He's now ready and waiting for the Bridge return, saying: \\u2018We are playing against the Premier League leaders so obviously we've got something to prove to everyone as well. \\u2018I'm not surprised to see them where they are. They are a good bunch of lads and there's a lot of confidence from that 4-2 opening day win at Arsenal and they've just kept it going.\\u2019 Chelsea, without nine first-teamers, introduce left-back Anthony Barness, a \\u00a3350,000 buy from Charlton, and versatile Nigel Spackman, who has returned to Stamford Bridge in a \\u00a3485,000 move from Glasgow Rangers. Vinny Jones has been sold to Wimbledon and David Lee is set to come in for Paul Elliott, who will be out for the season with injury. Skipper Andy Townsend, another Norwich old boy said: \\u2018If we can get them all back fit again, get a few wins and the confidence going, there's no reason why we can't get up there.\\u2019 Norwich's Mark Robins \\u2014 Fleck's \\u00a3800,000 replacement \\u2014 is looking to pep up his form. He's scored four in just five starts, and said: \\u2018It's been a good start but I still don't think I've been at my best.\\u2019 TOWNSEND: Rally cry GLORY HUNTER: Fleck has medal hopes at Chelsea FAST FORWARDS CRYSTAL Palace unveil their new strike force today when Paul Williams and Chris Armstrong team up against Oldham at Selhurst Park. They are hoping their pace can produce the goals to give Palace their first victory of the season. The new signings also face the pressure of winning over the fans who idolised Ian Wright, now at Arsenal, and Mark Bright who moved to Sheffield Wednesday last week. England B forward Williams, 27, said: \\u2018I don't know too much about Chris but I know he is very fast.\\u2018 TONY'S BACK MARTIN RICHARDS TONY MYLER is back in a Widnes jersey tomorrow \\u2014 a month after he was on the verge of quitting the game. Injuries have savaged the career of one of the brightest talents in Rugby League \\u2014 but ex-Great Britain stand-off Myler is determined to make a fresh start. He signed a new 12-month contract yesterday and coach Phil Larder puts him straight into the side for the Greenalls Lancashire Cup first round home tie with Carlisle. \\u2018It's a great bonus for us. Tony is a bit special and in the Garry Schofield-Ellery Hanley class,\\u2019 said Larder. \\u2018He will strengthen our squad and give us a lot more options this season. \\u2018Tony was thinking of packing it in over a month ago but I told him to go away and talk it over with his family first. \\u2018He decided to carry on and returned to training four weeks ago. With Bobby Goulding suspended, the chance to give Tony a quick return was too good to miss.\\u2019 Myler said: \\u2018I've been fed up of injuries and played only eight matches last season after a neck operation. \\u2018But I couldn't bring myself to throw the boots away and am not 31 until later this month. I reckon I still have another two or three seasons left if I keep clear of injury.\\u2019 Coach Larder is delighted with the form of Welsh winger Adrian Hadley in his first two games. \\u2018He's lost a stone in weight and is looking very strong,\\u2019 said Larder. \\u2018Adrian feels he didn't get the success he deserved at Salford and is relishing playing with a side with so many good individual players.\\u2019 MYLER: Fresh start Back to his roots GREAT Britain star Graeme Hallas is back in action this weekend \\u2014 but not with Hull or Hull KR in Sunday's Humberside derby. Rovers' contract rebel, who is the subject of a reported \\u00a370,000 bid from Hull, has temporarily turned his back on the professional game to return to his amateur roots. He misses the Yorkshire Cup clash, opting instead to play for Dudley Hill reserves in the Yorkshire League. Hallas, who is transfer-listed at \\u00a3180,000, wants to play amateur rugby in a bid to keep fit until a fee is agreed. Tony Myler returns for Widnes tomorrow \\u2014 a month after he nearly quit the game. He signed a new 12-month contract yesterday and comes straight into the side to face Carlisle. HALLAS: Keeping fit PLANGE'S PLUNGE! Sheffield Eagles 34 Halifax 14 DEVASTATING David Plange dumped big-spending Halifax out of the Yorkshire Cup with a three-try supershow. Sheffield looked like being overwhelmed as tries by new boys Gary Divorty and John Bentley powered Halifax 10-0 ahead in 11 minutes. But Plange hit back with two tries in three minutes \\u2014 and when Mark Aston's conversion and penalty were followed by a 46th-minute debut try from Gary Jack, it was all over. Bentley scored his second after a dazzling run to narrow the gap to 20-14. But Plange completed his hat-trick and sub Ian Hughes scored the try of the night after a 40-yard dash. PLANGE: Hat-trick HOKO HEAD CASE IAN GIBB CIRCUS contortionist Fabrice Benichou reckons he can tie world featherweight champion Paul Hodkinson in knots tonight and grab the WBC title. The rugged little Frenchman growled: \\u2018Hodkinson will have to do a Houdini to escape from me.\\u2019 Benichou likes to use his head if the fists won't do the job for him, and the atmosphere is definitely hostile down here in the South of France \\u2014 but Scouser Hoko is totally unmoved. Shaking The Merseysider told me: \\u2018I've been used to fighting away from home all my life \\u2014 it doesn't bother me.\\u2019 And Hodkinson added: \\u2018After beating a fighter as good as Mexico's Marcos Villasana to win the title, I'm not exactly shaking in my shoes about facing Benichou.\\u2019 But the Frenchman is known to use his head. And Geordie John Davison, who was unlucky to lose to Benichou, warns: \\u2018He brings his head up and catches you before you know it. He split my eye doing that in our first fight.\\u2019 READY: Hodkinson FALDO FLIPS TONY STENSON SUPERSTAR Nick Faldo proved himself less than awesome yesterday. And it cost him a share of the halfway lead in the \\u00a3600,000 GA European Open at Sunningdale. The Open champion had blitzed the famous old course with six birdies when he reached the 17th tee. At that stage he was an amazing 154 under par for his rounds in Europe this season. But then followed a pushed drive into heather, a hack out and an iron shot into a bunker before he carded a double-bogey six. Faldo, who called his game \\u2018awesome\\u2019 on his way to winning the Irish Open, snapped: \\u2018Forget that \\u2014 now I'll have to find another word.\\u2019 But he added: \\u2018I played really well and that drive (with a three-wood) was my only bad shot of the day. I paid a price.\\u2019 Despite the disaster, he carded a 66 for a two-round total of 133. But it did let in 6ft 5in Swede Robert Karlsson \\u2014 the tallest player on the European tour. His 67 gave him a nine-under total, two better than Faldo. England's Mark James also crept past Faldo on 132. Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher, on a rare playing excursion, showed he can still fight with the best. He is on four-under 136. But for Seve Ballesteros there was an early trip home to see his week-old son. Troubled by a cold and a painful left shoulder, he managed only a 73 and for the third time in four starts missed the cut. GREEN GODDESS: Caddie Fanny Sunesson helps Nick Faldo line up a birdie putt at Sunningdale MITCH IS BACK MITCHELL THOMAS makes his first appearance of the season for West Ham at Peterborough today, replacing suspended skipper Julian Dicks. Transfer-listed Thomas comes in at left back as Dicks starts a three-match match ban following his red card for elbowing Franz Carr at Newcastle last month. Thomas was signed from Spurs last year for \\u00a3500,000, but has not been able to establish himself at Upton Park. He was put up for sale before the start of this season. Striker Mike Small returns to a 15-man squad after suspension. Former Hammers player Bobby Barnes lines up against his old club. ERIK CRISIS ERIK Thorstvedt will seek crisis talks with Spurs if he is left out of the side at Coventry on Monday. The Norwegian international goalkeeper is worried that playing second fiddle to Ian Walker at Tottenham will harm his World Cup prospects of playing against England in October. \\u2018The time will come quite shortly when something has to be done,\\u2019 said Thorstvedt. \\u2018The Norwegian national coach is a very fair and honest man. But he has told me that if I'm not regularly in the Spurs first team then it will be very difficult for him to pick me.\\u2019 BASSETT SORRY! JOHN EDWARDS DAVE BASSETT last night apologised to striker Ian Bryson, saying: \\u2018I've probably cost you a Scotland cap.\\u2019 The Sheffield United boss tipped his versatile front-runner for international honours last season when he formed a productive partnership with England's Brian Deane. But the 29-year-old is still waiting to make the breakthrough. Bassett said: \\u2018It's my fault for messing him about, switching him from one flank to the other then playing him through the middle. \\u2018I should have stuck with playing him down the middle. \\u2018That's where he likes playing best and is where he's managed to weigh in with some vital goals.\\u2019 Liverpool visit Bramall Lane today with Bassett admitting that the Blades' morale has slumped. Bassett, who yesterday put midfielder Mike Lake on the transfer list, said: \\u2018We have allowed our confidence to be affected by a few bad results. \\u2018We have dug ourselves into a hole. But now it's up to us to lift ourselves out of it.\\u2019 FRIENDLY BANKER! CHARLES FAWCUS USER FRIENDLY should make today another classic payday for local hero George Duffield so long as she gets the green light to tackle the Coalite St Leger at Doncaster. Yorkshire-born George waited 25 years for his first classic win on User Friendly at Epsom in June. But the follow up came in Ireland a month later and number three beckons this afternoon. But everything depends on the state of the Doncaster track, finally watered last night. \\u2018We want to run but we will not risk her unless the going is right,\\u2019 said trainer Clive Brittain. And Allegan will drop out as well is it hasn't rained, to leave a disappointing six-runner field. But there is still every chance of User Friendly running and Duffield has no doubt that his filly is the best horse in the race. \\u2018You saw what she did at Epsom and in Ireland. She didn't win so well at York, but I'd have to admit I wasn't at my best there. \\u2018I'd been involved in that plane near miss on the way to York which would have frightened anyone and it was hard to concentrate properly. Everything went wrong, but she got me out of trouble. \\u2018It was a good effort in any case because Niodini, who finished fourth, has already won a big race at Doncaster this week.\\u2019 The watering won't please everyone with Bonnie Scot and Rain Rider best on a fast surface. But the one to trouble User Friendly could be Lester Piggott's mount Mack The Knife. There is plenty of top tele-action tomorrow with BBC covering the re-match between St Jovite and Dr Devious in Leopardstown's Champion Stakes and Channel Four showing highlights of the Arc trials at Longchamp. Trev's Bright spark JOHN EDWARDS MARK BRIGHT last night promised Sheffield Wednesday fans a double act to match his prolific partnership with Ian Wright. The 30-year-old striker became big-spending Trevor Francis\\u2019 latest recruit when he completed a swap deal that took Paul Williams and a \\u00a3375,000 cash adjustment to Crystal Palace. And he will make his debut at Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest today with instructions to fill the gap left by David Hirst's injury. But it's as Hirst's sidekick rather than replacement that Bright can see his Wednesday career taking off. Wright and Bright caused havoc among defences before Palace sold Wright to Arsenal. And a re-run of those days could be just a couple of weeks away. Hirst is on the mend after cracking his ankle at Highbury a fortnight ago, and Bright said: \\u2018I like his style of play and feel we can work well together. Linking \\u2018He is a strong runner who is very quick and very direct, and the fact that he and Chris Waddle are both Wednesday players was a big factor in my decision to move here. \\u2018I'm really looking forward to linking up with David because I believe we can go on to become every bit as good as the partnership I had with Ian.\\u2019 Francis was delighted at landing Bright \\u2014 even if it was at the third time of asking. \\u2018I tried to sign him at QPR three years ago, then again during the summer,\\u2019 said Wednesday's player-boss. \\u2018But Steve Coppell told me I couldn't have him until he found a replacement. \\u2018Finally, we got the go-ahead, but only as long as we included Paul Williams.\\u2019 Francis backs Taylor NEIL SILVER GERRY Francis last night leapt to the defence of Graham Taylor and insisted: \\u2018We've got to get together to help England.\\u2019 Former England skipper Francis, now manager of QPR, believes that the structure of English football does no favours to managers at both club and international level. \\u2018It is very important that players do go and play for their country, but we haven't got it right here,\\u2019 said Francis. \\u2018We've got to sort out the balance between club and country because it's very important to both sets of managers. \\u2018It is great for players and their clubs when they are picked for their country. I played for and captained my country so I know how important it is and I would never stop anybody going. \\u2018But we've got to look at ways of helping Graham Taylor. The whole structure of the season, plus the situation with World Cup and European Championship games, has got to be looked at because at the moment we just seem to penalise successful teams. \\u2018If teams are doing well in the League, Cups and Europe then they are forced to play so many games. If those teams have also got players in the international set up they suffer.\\u2019 Francis is disappointed that the chance to change football for the good with the introduction of the Premier League has been wasted. He said: \\u2018There was a lot of talk about the Premier League going to be right for England, but I don't think anything changed. It hasn't done anyone any favours.\\u2019 Defender David Bardsley is ruled out of today's match at Southampton by an ankle injury picked up playing for England in Spain, while Andy Sinton is also very doubtful with a sore foot. Victory at the Dell today would keep Rangers among the early season front runners. Rush to honour a boss on the brink BRIAN CLOUGH is to be given the Freedom of Nottingham \\u2014 after rumours in the city that his reign at Forest could be coming to an end. Council leaders want to bestow the highest honour  they can in recognition of Clough's achievements with Nottingham Forest. But Forest are currently bottom of the Premier League and the leader of the Labour controlled council, Cllr Betty Higgins, said: \\u2018We had heard a rumour that Brian may not be in charge of Forest for much longer. It was just something that someone said. \\u2018I don't know whether it's true or not but we wanted to do it while he is still in charge.\\u2019 Clough has already been approached privately and has confirmed he will accept the honour. The last people to be given the distinction were Olympic and world champion ice skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1983. WE'LL PLAY FOR NOTHING! World Cup stars put country before cash England's glory boys HARRY HARRIS GRAHAM Taylor's players are willing to play for nothing in England's World Cup ties \\u2014 starting with Norway at Wembley on October 14. The country's elite have already been sounded out by Taylor to scrap appearance money, as well as the win and draw  bonuses that have existed since Don Revie's era. Honour The players will discuss the plan again prior to the Norway match, which will be make-or-break for the credibility of Taylor. The players are sure to vote in favour of the motion to play for the honour and not the cash. At present England players are paid \\u00a3300 by the FA for being selected, \\u00a3500 for a draw and \\u00a3700 for a win. After the latest set-back in Spain, and the public mauling for the England manager, this is the one major plus-factor for Taylor. The public would applaud the axing of cash rewards for players to wear the England shirt. The new plan was explained to the players when they gathered in Luton before flying out to Spain. New England captain Stuart Pearce told me: \\u2018This is something we shall give serious thought to. \\u2018In any case, I believe the players play for the honour and glory rather than the money.\\u2019 A major part of the financial restructuring will be a new players' pool. For 21 years, the players have used an agent to privately negotiate commercial deals which have been split between the squad and the management team. Now the commercial deals will come under the umbrella of the FA. It worked for the last World Cup, when the FA paid a \\u00a330,000-a-man bonus for reaching the semi-finals. ENGLAND CRISIS: Thursday's Mirror Sport Nice touch, Nigel NOW here's something for England manager Graham Taylor to consider. He wants a world beater in his side so how about Nigel Mansell as a driving force in his next squad. Taylor, of course, would need to do a deal  with his Williams-Renault team and a little matter of around \\u00a38million would perhaps secure his services \\u2014 he would guarantee to put Taylor's men in pole position! Mansell warmed-up for tomorrow's Italian Grand Prix by playing soccer. He drove in a goal and then laid one on for German driver Michael Schumacher. CARRY ON CHAMP \\u2014 Page 25  False start CARL Lewis, who bleated because he wasn't allowed to run in the Olympics against Linford Christie, has ducked out of the World Cup in Cuba where they would have met for a 100 metres showdown later this month. Kent's run spree KENT went run crazy yesterday as they piled up a 603 for eight \\u2014 their highest total since 1934 \\u2014 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. Carl Hooper joined Trevor Ward and Mark Benson as a century-maker to stretch his side's formidable overnight 487 for three to massive proportions. He reached 102 off 167 balls before been caught behind off Tim Munton. Graham Cowdrey kept the runs flowing with a hard hit 88. Then Alan Igglesden took five for 34 as Warwickshire slid to 121 for five \\u2014 still 482 behind. Victory will ensure that Kent collect the \\u00a323,000 prize as runners-up to Essex in the Britannic Assurance Championship. Hoko asks high price IAN GIBB PAUL Hodkinson and Colin McMillan are demanding \\u00a3500,000 between them for a world featherweight title showdown. That emerged after Hoko saw off gutsy Frenchman Fabrice Benichou through a gashed upper lip in the 10th round of his WBC title defence in Toulouse. WBO champ McMillan was at the fight and his promoter Frank Warren made Hoko an offer of \\u00a3200,000 for a unification battle. But Hodkinson said: \\u2018Not enough. I think the fight is worth more, at least another \\u00a350,000 on top of that. It's a big fight. \\u2018I think I should earn more as the WBC title is recognised as a better class than the WBO but I might come to a 50-50 split.\\u2019 McMillan said: \\u2018There's no way I'll take the smaller share. I'd settle for an equal share.\\u2019 Whether the two little fighting men are pricing themselves out of the market remains to be seen but both were threatening a stand-off. Hodkinson's promoter, Barney Eastwood, revealed: \\u2018French TV loved Paul so much they are willing to have him back before Christmas and fight an opponent of his own choosing.\\u2019 And that's if the Eastwood camp can persuade WBC mandatory number one challenger, Kevin Kelly, to stand back rather than be forced to go to New York to take him on. HOKO: Demand Hawks swoop CHICAGO Blackhawks have won the Molson Challenge and a large share of the \\u00a325,000 prize, beating Montreal Canadiens 2-1 after a scoreless period of extra time and two penalty shoot-outs. CUT IT OUT! BLACKBURN keeper Bobby Mimms makes sure Arsenal hit man Ian Wright gets the message after one of several skirmishes between the two in the Battle of Highbury Picture: ARNOLD SLATER  OFF TO THE DOGS HARRY LLOYD MIGHTY Scurlogue Champ strides onto the smallest stage of his career at Mildenhall on Saturday. But the most charismatic greyhound since Mick The Miller will merely walk the circuit prior to the Daily Mirror race in his honour. Now ten years old and sprouting grey whiskers, the Red Rum of the dog tracks gets top billing at Mildenhall's gala meeting. Excited \\u2018He'll get excited, thinking he's going to race,\\u2019 said Wayne Peckham, who was still at school when he nicknamed the bargain-buy \\u2018Duke\\u2019. Wayne's grandparents, Ken and Pat Peckham, paid just \\u00a31,700 for Champ whose marathon exploits quickly made him the people's champion. The Champ, who retired six years, was an institution and his extraordinary finishing burst took him to 20 track records. Promoters who fought for his services paid appearance money for the wonder dog who could boost attendances by 500 per cent. And his public relations value to greyhound racing was estimated at a million pounds. Among the early entries for the Scurlogue Champ race is leading marathon performer Poor Sue. Even if she sets a track record she would already have been upstaged by the people's champion. Catford's John Humphreys Gold Collar semi-finals could provide a Westmead double for sisters Surprise and Spirit. Both were strong-finishing second round winners and head the sponsor's betting for Saturday's final. Side Wink, earmarked for Wembley's Wendy Fair St Leger, can underline her classic claims in the Tony Morris Variety Club Stakes at the Empire Stadium. Desperately unlucky at Crayford last month, the lightweight bitch has since won over the Leger course. Clongeel Rebel, an even-money flop last time out at Crayford, gets a quick chance to atone in the Kent track's charity meeting. Pennys Sweetness and Clashganiff Hero hold bright chances at Hackney tomorrow and in the evening Oyster Duke, Our Muriel and Deepwell Minx could be worth supporting at Walthamstow. PAT PECKHAM pointing the way for Champ's celebrity appearance at Mildenhall. DEVIOUS DELIGHT HARLES FAWCUS DR DEVIOUS dished out the medicine at Leopardstown yesterday, but the Epsom Derby winner will be needing treatment when he runs into User Friendly in the Arc. That's the confident view of Clive Brittain, carrying all before him after User Friendly's demolition job in the St Leger. The Doctor took his revenge on St Jovite in a dramatic finish to the Kerry Group Champion Stakes, but Clive has no doubt that he can beat both of them. Nostril \\u2018My horse Alflora was third today and he wouldn't be in the same street as User Friendly. She would have won this all right,\\u2019 he declared. Dr Devious had finished twelve lengths behind St Jovite in the Irish Derby and they were separated by less than a nostril yesterday. St Jovite had rounded the final turn in front, but John Reid was on his tail on Dr Devious and forced his horse in front right on the line as Christy Roche was forced to ease off because his mount was hanging. Roche took St Jovite into No. 1 spot, but the photo went against him and Dr Devious's trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam expects more improvement from his horse. \\u2018This will put him spot on for the Arc. I wanted to leave a bit for next time,\\u2019 he declared. St Jovite's trainer Jim Bolger wasn't disappointed; \\u2018It was a super race and you must expect it hard against horses as good as this.\\u2019 St Jovite will certainly be happier going right-handed at Longchamp, but no one was happier than Brittain. He picked up another big prize in Ireland yesterday with Mr Martini and he was still bubbling over User Friendly's St Leger triumph. \\u2018I can't compare her with any of the top horses I've trained because I just don't know how good she is. \\u2018She lost less weight on Saturday than she had at York and we have got to think of a crack at the Arc. Handy Andy COLIN PRICE NIGERIAN prince Andrew Harriman warmed up for next week's Pilkington Cup rugby final repeat against Bath with a regal hat-trick of tries for Harlequins in a 64-6 win at Plymouth. Bath's replacement for the injured Stuart Barnes, Craig Raymond, set up a try and scored a drop goal in their 18\\u201315 win over Italians Treviso. Leicester's British Lion No 8 Dean Richards again helped out in the second-row for their 40-24 win over Milan. Gloucester beat Sale 17-11 while Bristol thumped Rugby 35-13. Platt out by a nose DAVID Platt was forced to miss Juventus's league game with Atalanta yesterday after sustaining a broken nose during England's defeat in Spain on Wednesday. Platt, who has yet to make his Italian League debut for Juventus, said: \\u2018My nose has been X-rayed and confirmed as broken, although I thought I was fit enough to play today. I hope to play in our UEFA Cup game on Wednesday.\\u2019 Platt was left out of Juventus's opening match last Sunday and has been told he may only play in Juventus' home game. TEL'S WAR TONY STENSON SPURS supremo Terry Venables has declared war on the eight Premier League rebels who blocked the \\u00a313million sponsorship deal with brewers Bass. He has called a summit on Thursday for the 14 clubs who opposed Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Everton, Leeds, Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers. Venables said: \\u2018It is a meeting to discuss the whole situation. \\u2018It is not a secret meeting. Premier League chief Rick Parry has been invited but it is only for the 14 clubs. \\u2018I am very  positive about saving the sponsorship deal.\\u2019 VENABLES: Positive LEIGH-WAY LEIGH boss Jim Crellin quit last night after only three matches in charge. He and assistant Ray Clark re-signed after Leigh's first win of the season, a 50-9 Lancashire Cup success over Third Division Chorley. Crellin, who took over at promoted Leigh from sacked Kevin Ashcroft this summer, said: \\u2018I have resigned because of boardroom interference.\\u2019 Leigh lost both First Division matches against Warrington and Bradford before beating Chorley. Davies is on target Widnes 52 Carlisle 8 JONATHAN Davies scored 20 points as Widnes went on a scoring spree that took them into the second round of the Lancashire Cup. Davies scored a spectacular final try and landed eight goals, including some brilliant long-range shots. Widnes had it won by half-time with a 28-0 lead but Carlisle battled on bravely and scored two well-taken tries in the second half. And they were unlucky to have hooker Malcolm Thomason carried off with concussion midway through the half. Skipper Paul Hulme and centre Stuart Spruce led the Widnes try-scoring romp with two each. DAVIES: On target FORD RUNS RIOT Salford 60, W'haven 8 WING wizard Phil Ford treated himself to five touchdowns as Whitehaven were swamped under a tidal wave of tries in this Lancashire Cup tie. Sizzling Salford, who have never lost to their Third Division opponents at the Willows, crossed 12 times. Two tries came from new Aussie recruit Craig Coleman. The 28-year-old scrum-half only landed in England last Thursday. But the South Sydney star shrugged off jet-lag to play a major role. Kevin Tamati's men led 24-2 at the break with Coleman going over in the 32nd and 34th minutes. Whitehaven hit back with a John Routledge try and Steve MacGuire conversion. But then Salford turned on the heat, with seven tries in the last half hour. FORD: Five tries LIFT MARTIN RICHARDS PETER Coyne is 80 minutes away from a Sydney Grand Final appearance \\u2014 leaving Castleford to play a frustrating waiting game. Coyne's second half drop goal for St George clinched a 3-2 win over Newcastle. The Dragons now play Illawarra next weekend to see who will meet the Brisbane Broncos. Castleford desperately need Coyne to lift their fortunes after three opening defeats. TERROR TINY Oldham ace hits Wires MARTIN RICHARDS Oldham 33, Warrington 20 GIANT prop \\u2018Tiny\\u2019 Solomona softened up Warrington for the kill and three-try centre Iva Ropati fired the bullets as Second  Division Oldham produced the only upset of the Greenall's Lancashire Cup first round. The Wires had no answer to the power and fire of the 6ft 2in, 17-stone Solomona who formed an outstanding front row pairing with No.8 Mark Sheals. Solomona blasted over for an important try just before the break after smart interpassing with Sheals. And the big Aucklander really came into his own in the second half after the 50th-minute dismissal of Warrington prop Neil Harmon for a high tackle on Oldham hooker Richard Pachnuik. Harmon's loss, when Oldham were leading 18\\u201310, spelled the end of any real hopes Warrington had of pulling the game out of the fire. They gamely fought back to 27-20 with a Rob Myler try 10 minutes from time. But Solomona caused more havoc with another explosive burst and the ball was fanned right for full-back Sean Tyrer to stroll over for a sixth Oldham try. Spirit Two-try Warrington scrum-half Kevin Ellis didn't deserve to draw losing pay in his first match of the season. But the Wires, plagued by too many errors, never applied enough  consistent pressure to break Oldham's spirit, despite the class of Ellis, Kelly Shelford and Greg Mackey. And full-back Robert Turner had a miserable day with his kicking, landing only two goals from seven shots. OLDHAM prop \\u2018Tiny\\u2019 Solomona powers through the Wires defence. ELLIS: Double Warrington couldn't get themselves back into the match after having Neil Harmon (bottom right) sent off for a high tackle in the second half. SPEED TRAP Rangers are on the up Fan-war Dave is peacemaker NEIL SILVER Southampton 1, QPR 2 DAVID SPEEDIE was yesterday cleared of all blame for his pitch battle with an unruly Southampton fan. The fiery Scot was first to react when two supporters ran on to The Dell to stage an injury-time protest. And when one made it to the centre circle and started his own sit-in, to Speedie that was like a red rag to a bull. With Southampton trailing 2-1 and desperate for an equaliser, he grabbed the fan around the head and tried to drag him from the pitch. But the protester shrugged him off and Speedie \\u2014 already on an assault charge following a skirmish with a supporter last season \\u2014 was close to wading in again. QPR's Clive Wilson pleaded in vain with the fan to leave and finally four stewards carried the man away. Speedie explained later: \\u2018When the fan ran on I thought he might be going for the referee, so I tried to intervene. \\u2018He sat down and we wanted to get on with the game and try for another goal, so I wanted him off. \\u2018But I already have an assault charge hanging over me, so in the end I had to leave it to the stewards. \\u2018I didn't mean the man any harm \\u2014 he was just an idiot. But we were losing and as someone had to get him off his backside I thought it might as well be me.\\u2019 Two fans were charged with public order offences, but a police spokesman confirmed that no action had been taken against Speedie. And Southampton secretary Brian Truscott said: \\u2018As far as we are concerned all David was doing was encouraging a fan to leave the pitch.\\u2019 Added manager Ian Branfoot: \\u2018David was annoyed because it was one of our own fans wasting our time. I have no objection to what he tried to do.\\u2019 The sit-down came on a day when Saints fans picked up on the \\u2018Branfoot out\\u2019 chants they began last season. But Branfoot insisted: \\u2018We have to keep producing and selling the Alan Shearers and Rod Wallaces to survive. \\u2018It's always going to be like that here and anyone who thinks differently is living in cloud cuckoo land.\\u2019 Matthew Le Tissier gave Saints a 12th-minute lead, only for Rangers to reply with two second-half goals in as many minutes. After being tripped by Terry Hurlock, Andy Sinton got up to curl a brilliant 25-yard free kick round the wall. Then Sinton started the move which ended with Les Ferdinand crossing low for Justin Canning to volley the winner. FLASH \\u2018N GRAB ANGRY David Speedie lays  into the protesting fan after his last-minute sit-down strike at The Dell Pool king JON SMITH, head of First Artist Corporation, has been offered a five year contract by the FA to help organise the new England players\\u2019 pool. Smith's organisation has run their commercial activities for the past six years. Now the FA plan to take the players pool under their umbrella, retaining Smith because of his success working with the players since the 1986 World Cup finals. Bruce is top target NIGEL CLARKE CHELSEA will this morning open negotiations to buy a new goalkeeper \\u2014 and Bruce Grobbelaar heads the short list to replace disgraced ex-England star Dave Beasant. Manager Ian Porterfield indicated Beasant's Stamford Bridge career is all but over after his dreadful errors gifted victory to Norwich on Saturday. \\u2018We shall be definitely making every effort to improve that department as soon as possible,\\u2019 said Porterfield, who tried to sign Grobbelaar last year. \\u2018Our fans are the best, they deserve the best, and I have got to make a change.\\u2019 GROBBELAAR: Wanted Bruce is top target  GROBBELAAR: Wanted I QUIT Mansell out in tears TED MACAULEY WORLD champion Nigel Mansell sensationally decided to quit Grand Prix racing yesterday. And, to complete his heartbreak, his car broke down when he was looking for his ninth win of the season at the Italian Grand Prix. Mansell stunned the Grand Prix race world when he revealed that he was packing up only four hours before he was due to start in his 178th Grand Prix. He was close to tears when he started to read a statement in which he opened his heart as never before. And even as he began, a top executive from Renault-Williams tried to persuade him not to go through with it. But Mansell shook his head, ignored the request and read: \\u2018Due to circumstances beyond my control I have decided to retire from Formula One at the end of the season. \\u2018I have made this decision with some regret \\u2014 but not without a great deal of thought.\\u2019 Mansell, 39, and a winner of 29 GPs went on: \\u2018Any relationship between a driver and an F1 team is vital for success and partly dependent on money because it defines how seriously the team and its backers take the driver. \\u2018But those who know me well understand the importance of the human side and the mutual trust, goodwill, integrity and fair play that are the basis of all human relationships. \\u2018All these issues have suffered in recent weeks.\\u2019 He added: \\u2018Looking back, I feel that relationships between me and the team started to break down at the Hungarian Grand Prix.\\u2019 And he revealed: \\u2018A deal was agreed with Frank Williams before that race in front of a witness and I have to say that at the time I felt very, good about racing again with Williams in 1993. Having won the championship I was looking forward to defending it with what I believe to be a very competitive car. \\u2018However, three days after Hungary I was telephoned by a Williams director. \\u2018He said he had been instructed to tell me that because Ayrton Senna would drive for nothing, I, the new world champion, had to accept a massive reduction in remuneration from the figure agreed in Hungary. Badly treated \\u2018It was considerably less than I am getting this year. If I did not, then Senna was ready to sign that night. I rejected the offer and said that, if these were the terms, Williams had better go ahead and sign Senna. \\u2018Since then relations with the team have not been good. And I refer to the directors rather than the scores of people behind the scenes at Williams. \\u2018I have listened to many different opinions, some well-meaning and some not, and we've heard public statements made by Senna. \\u2018To say that I have been badly treated is a gross understatement. \\u2018Of course, a team-owner, any team-owner, is free to choose whomever he likes to work for him. It was a lack of information, and sudden changes, that I found disappointing.\\u2019 \\u2018It all comes down to \\u2018fair play\\u2019 or the lack of it. Money, a trigger for the problems after Hungary is now no longer an issue for me. \\u2018As for myself I know that I am not yet ready to retire completely. \\u2018I still love motor racing and I still want to win. So I may look at the Indy Car World Series in America and see what opportunities are available if any.\\u2019 Later Frank Williams wouldn't reveal whether he had made last-ditch efforts to persuade Mansell to drive on. And he would only say \\u2018I'll be having something to say later on in the week.\\u2019 Senna admitted yesterday after his third win that he has been having talks with Williams. But he is likely to be kept out of the team by Prost who is believed to have a deal which bars the Brazilian from coming in as his partner. And that could open the way for Martin Brundle, fired by Benetton, but second yesterday in the best finish of his career. POLE-AXED THE strain breaks through as an emotional Nigel Mansell quits. WILLIAMS: Promise MANSELL: Hit by massive pay cut Hit-and-run kills granny A HIT-and-run driver who killed an 84-year-old granny was being hunted by police last night. Mother-of-five Margaret Morrison died early yesterday after she was mown down by a speeding Ford Escort in Premier Road, Sunderland. Two men were later seen running from the abandoned car. TV jobs axe AT least 100 jobs are to be axed at recently merged Yorkshire and Tyne Tees TV. Bosses say the losses will be in admin and programme-making. WE FEAR LEE LEE Chapman, Leeds United's giant striker, has Stuttgart quaking in their boots at the prospect of tomorrow's European Cup clash. Stuttgart coach Christov Daum watched Leeds at Elland Road last Sunday then declared: \\u2018Chapman is my headache. \\u2018He's so good in the air. I haven't a defender to deal with him.\\u2019 Chapman hopes Leeds do better than the Arsenal team he played for in his last European appearance 10 years ago. The Gunners lost to Moscow Spartak 3-2 and 5-2 in the UEFA Cup, with Chapman scoring in both legs. Daum expects another upset. He said: \\u2018Leeds are not playing with the same confidence as when they won the title. \\u2018We have to stop them scoring. I would even be happy with a 0-0 draw.\\u2019 CHAPMAN: Danger Hardy chases dream NORTH-East fight rivals Billy Hardy and John Davison are lining up a bonanza \\u00a3100,000 pay night\\u2026against each other! Hardy, former British bantamweight champion, fights Aussie Ricky Rayner for the vacant Commonwealth featherweight title on October 7 at Sunderland's Crowtree Leisure centre. If he wins that he's set to meet Newcastle's newly-crowned British champion Davison in the Spring with both titles at stake. \\u2018We'd look to fill either St James's Park or Roker Park,\\u2019 said Hardy's joint manager Mickey Duff. HARDY: Title shot STEVE GETS LIFT KEVIN Keegan has told young Steve Watson that he's still wanted. Watson, 18, won an Under-21 cap with England in Spain last week \\u2014 then found himself playing for Newcastle juniors. The lad who made a big impact as a 16-year-old has been ignored this season. But Keegan said yesterday: \\u2018Steve's got a great future at Newcastle. He hasn't been forgotten. \\u2018He is very much in contention for a first-team place, although he may not think so after playing for the juniors. \\u2018He did ever so well in that match, which showed he has a terrific attitude. Nothing bothers him.\\u2019 Mick Quinn collected three crates of champagne from chairman Sir John Hall after scoring twice against former club Portsmouth. Hall threw in the third crate for a Quinn goal that was disallowed. KEEGAN: Praise MIKE'S BACK COLIN PRICE WORLD Cup hero Mike Teague is roaring back as England search for a record-breaking third Grand Slam, writes Colin Price. The big Gloucester builder was so badly battered in the World Cup campaign that he had to take six months off work \\u2014 and he and self-employed forward Paul Rendall lost so much money that they successfully appealed for a hardship payment. But Teague has been named in a 31-man squad for England's opening friendly against Canada at Wembley on October 17. And he said: \\u2018I've had a good rest now and it remains to be seen whether I have still got it. But I know I am certainly not finished.\\u2019 WIDE BOYS NEIL SILVER MATTHEW Le Tissier believes the England team is big enough for both him and Andy Sinton. Both men scored when QPR beat Southampton at the Dell on Saturday, raising the question of who deserves to be England's wide boy-wonder. Rangers ace Sinton is the man in possession at the moment, but Saints star Le Tissier believes there is room in the team for them both. \\u2018I don't see Andy and myself as rivals for an England place,\\u2019 said Le Tissier. \\u2018He plays more on the left hand side which is not my favourite position, I prefer to play on the right. \\u2018It would be very nice if he was on one wing and I was on the other.\\u2019 Both men scored a quality goal apiece on Saturday. Sinton is one of the new generation of England players introduced by Graham Taylor against Poland last November. Le Tissier, who is Southampton's top scorer this season with three goals, has yet to win his first full cap. Jacki jolts boss COLIN PRICE BRISTOL City's Polish striker Jacki Dziekanowski was involved in a wine-bar scuffle at the weekend. He received hospital treatment for a cut eye and a split lip but told police that he did not want to press charges. His former manager Jimmy Lumsden admitted that only Dziekanowski's reputation for the high life enabled City to snap up the ball-playing genius from Celtic for a bargain \\u00a3250,000. Now manager Denis Smith has to decide whether to risk Dziekanowski against West Ham tonight as City chase a first home win. Hoko's hitch PROMOTER Frank Warren yesterday warned rivals Colin McMillan and Paul Hodkinson that greed could prevent them meeting in a world title clash. WBC holder Hodkinson wants a \\u00a3250,000 purse but Warren, who is McMillan's promoter, said: \\u2018I don't want to see the big contests slip away because the fighters are too greedy. \\u2018They mustn't forget there's a recession going on and we've just got to be realistic about money.\\u2019 But Warren is prepared to meet Hodkinson halfway by paying him a further \\u00a325,000 \\u2014 provided he beats McMillan but he will have to offer the WBO champion the same. Hodkinson, 27 today, insisted on \\u00a3250,000 after Saturday's 10th round title victory over Fabrice Benichou in Toulouse. Strike it rich LEEDS are poised to cash in on last season's championship win by signing a multi-million pound sponsorship deal with a German company. Managing director Bill Fotherby will use this week's European Cup trip to Stuttgart to put the finishing touches to negotiations which could smash all records. He said: \\u2018When you're champions and in Europe, the sky's the limit. \\u2018That's why we did not get tied up to a long deal before. The situation was changing so fast and we hoped we might find ourselves in this situation.\\u2019 Leeds have sold the television rights for their first two European Cup rounds to UEFA and ITV for \\u00a3800,000. If they qualify for the Champions League (last eight) they get another guaranteed \\u00a3800,000, plus around \\u00a3180,000 a point. Manager Howard Wilkinson admitted: \\u2018You daren't think about what it means \\u2014 if you do that you end up thinking about what you might lose. I just know it's a very important game for Leeds.\\u2019 Rams-page BRIAN Clough's woes continued last night when Nottingham Forest were crushed 2-0 by Derby in a testimonial for former goalkeeper Steve Sutton. Nazi riot alert LEEDS fear that neo-Nazis will infiltrate tomorrow's European Cup tie here in Stuttgart and cause trouble. A large contingent of police from Yorkshire will mingle with the 1,200 Leeds supporters to try to ensure their trouble-free re-entry into Europe. They are well aware that a hooligan element scarred Leeds' last European match in Paris in 1974 \\u2014 also against German opposition. Les Walker, the FA's adviser on crowd control, travelled to Stuttgart yesterday. He told me: \\u2018The Germans are concerned because of Leeds\\u2019 past reputation. \\u2018And they have a major sport-related problem in their own country \\u2014 and a fascist problem. \\u2018But they are well prepared to deal with fascist situations.\\u2019 Walker's worry is that neo-Nazis will travel from all parts of Germany and treat the clash between the champions of England and of Germany almost like a mini international He is confident that Leeds have taken all reasonable precautions but added: \\u2018The great bulk of Leeds supporters are well behaved and will subject themselves to checks. \\u2018But there are sure to be around 150 who will come without any supervision.\\u2019 BAD BOY Bristol City 0, Southend 1 A BRISTOL City ball-boy was handed over to police during a bad-tempered second half at Ashton Gate. Referee Vic Callow stopped play and asked police to intervene after the boy made several comments. The home fans were angry because they thought Andy Ansah was offside when big striker Ian Benjamin hit the 75th-minute winner. BENJAMIN: Winner Super Stefan SWEDEN'S Stefan Edberg successfully defended his U.S. Open title by defeating American Pete Sampras 3-6, 6-4, 7-6, 6-2 in New York last night. The victory capped a tough week for second seed Edberg, who reached the final by winning three successive five-set matches. Edberg's victory lifted him over American Jim Courier to the top of the world rankings. \\u2018I just didn't have enough today,\\u2019 admitted rival Sampras. \\u00a34 TO BEAT UNITED Russian fear for Fergie KEN LAWRENCE ALEX FERGUSON and his men tonight face a bunch of \\u00a34-a-week footballers determined to battle from the Russian breadline to the big-time. For the players of Torpedo Moscow will not only be fighting for the honour of becoming the first side to beat Manchester United in a European tie at Old Trafford. For United's own Red flier, Andrei Kanchelskis, warns that the men from Moscow will be on a mission most public \\u2014 to sell themselves to the big-money clubs of Western Europe. Kanchelskis made that giant leap 18 months ago when he arrived from Donetsk. Now he drives a glamorous black BMW, owns a palatial house with a swimming pool and earns the kind of salary that would make the average Muscovite's eyes pop. Kanchelskis, forced out of tonight's UEFA first-round clash because of the restriction on foreigners, said: \\u2018The players from Torpedo will have one big plan in mind. \\u2018They will know the game is being televised all over Europe and they will give everything because of that. Contract \\u2018They will be hoping that their performance might bring them a big contract with a foreign club \\u2014 that would represent a way out for them. \\u2018So they will be tough to beat. They will be dangerous.\\u2019 One of the Russians \\u2014 left-wing danger man Yury Tishkov \\u2014 may already be halfway there. Sheffield Wednesday boss Trevor Francis is hoping for the same kind of bargain with Tishkov as Ferguson discovered when he paid just \\u00a3650,000 for Kanchelskis. Tishkov, 21, has scored seven goals in nine UEFA Cup matches and Ferguson stressed: \\u2018He is their danger man \\u2014 he is the one we must worry about most.\\u2019 Torpedo Moscow are on \\u00a380 a man to win \\u2014 a huge amount of money by their standards, even if it is buttons compared to the wealth of United's \\u00a34,000-a-week stars. Fergie's worries are compounded by suspension, injuries and the foreigners rule which will force him to bring in one 17-year-old youth player \\u2014 and have three others on the bench. He had hoped one of his Englishmen, Mike Phelan, would recover from an ankle injury, but the midfielder is almost certainly out. That means that one of a quartet of 17-year-olds \\u2014 Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville or Chris Casper will make a dramatic debut. Neil Webb and Danny Wallace will also figure, while the foreign players will be Brian McClair, Mark Hughes and Peter Schmeichel, with assimilated players Ryan Giggs and Denis Irwin joining them. Ferguson admitted: \\u2018If Phelan does not make it I will be in a bit of trouble because I need as many experienced men out there as I can muster.\\u2019 EURO THREAT: Ferguson and Kanchelskis Cup runs over RUGBY League bosses had to overcome the first major fixture hurdle of the season last night. The second round draw for the Greenall's Lancashire Cup threw up St Helens against Widnes. But the September 23 date clashed with the championship programme. The same applied to Wigan's tie against Swinton, because the champions meet Widnes on September 25 in a League match being televised by Sky. Draw: Swinton v Wigan (Tues Sept 29, 7.30pm at Gigg Lane, Bury), Leigh v Oldham (Wed Sept 23), Salford v Workington Town (Sept 23, 7.30pm), St Helens v Widnes (Wed Sept 30, 7.30pm). THE CAR THAT'S CAUSED ALL THE TROUBLE BUILT FOR A CHAMP THIS is the Grand Prix dream machine \\u2014 the \\u00a31million missile of a car that every top racer wants to drive. Quite simply, the new Williams FW15 is the greatest Grand Prix car of all time\\u2026and it is what all the fuss is about in Formula One. Three-times world champion Ayrton Senna would give up \\u00a312million a year just to get behind the wheel for nothing. Frenchman Alain Prost has come out of retirement in a bid to steer it to a fourth world title next season. They know it is a champion's car, a masterpiece of mechanics, electronics and space-age technology. Each Renault engine costs more than \\u00a3100,000 and they rocket the 800 brake horse-power car to a top speed of more than 200mph. It is so aerodynamically perfect and the down forces are so strong it could travel upside down across your ceiling at 150mph without falling off. Track Test driver Damon Hill gave the FW15 its first-ever shakedown at Silverstone yesterday. The car was driven straight from a studio photo session to the world's fastest track. Even retiring world champion Nigel Mansell will test the car he will never use in Grand Prix action. Mansell may be at odds with Team Renault-Williams, but he will be keen to give them all the feedback he can when he takes the dream car for a spin at Silverstone tomorrow. The car, which could have raced as early as May, will be fully prepared for action with Prost behind the wheel next season. Under new regulations it will run on thinner tyres than the 18inch wide version used this season. But they will still cost around \\u00a3350 each and Goodyear will supply the team with more than 2,000 for the season. MONDAY'S Back Page ROARING TO GO\\u2026but yesterday the new Williams FW15 dream car was sitting pretty at its unveiling in London. Retiring world champ Nigel Mansell will give it a spin around the Silver-stone circuit tomorrow and next season the super car makes its long-awaited Grand Prix debut. POLICE CALLED IN BETS COUP CHARLES FAWCUS JO N JACK'S Lingfield win was cleared by the Jockey Club yesterday, but winning punters won't get paid yet. Racing's bosses looked into the circumstances of the horse's 33-1 triumph and found that no rules had been broken. But they have passed some relevant information to the police, and BOLA are still investigating. \\u2018We have nothing to add at the moment,\\u2019 said a spokesperson for the betting shops association who advised bookies to withhold winnings after Jo N Jack's success eight days ago. The horse was racing for the first time for Epsom trainer Roger Ingram having previously run in Ireland for Joanna Morgan. But memories of the Flockton Grey affair of 1982 were revived when it was revealed that the horse was bred by Ken Richardson. He was given a suspended sentence and declared a disqualified person by the Jockey Club after it was discovered that a winning horse called Flockton Grey was a ringer. But Mr Richardson has always protested his innocence. Most of the winning bets on Jo N Jack were struck in Yorkshire and the horse is due to run again at Beverley to-morrow. Michael Roberts's second double in as many days at Sandown yesterday leaves him needing three wins a week to reach the magic 200-winner mark. \\u2018If he doesn't get there he'll probably sack me,\\u2019 smiled agent Graham Rock. If he doesn't get there he might also regret his defeat on Branston Abby who was caught close home by Our Rita. Steve out STEVE Archibald, ex-Scottish international, has parted company with Fulham after playing 155 minutes for the Second Division club. He joined them on a non-contract basis. Derby land Short KEN LAWRENCE CRAIG Short last night turned his back on Kenny Dalglish and a \\u00a32.5m move to Blackburn Rovers \\u2014 and opted to join Derby County. The Notts County star had been expected to travel north to last night's clash at Ewood Park, where money-bags Rovers lost 3-2 against Everton and missed their chance to bounce back to the top of the Premier Division. Instead he will join First Division big spenders Derby, who have made a disastrous start to their multi-million pound promotion campaign. Jim woe LONDON referee Tony Ward sent off Jim Magilton and booked seven other players as Oxford beat Cambridge 3-0 in a stormy First Division battle at the Manor Ground. Northern Ireland international Magilton, who had given Oxford the lead from the penalty spot, went after 58 minutes for retaliation after being fouled by Paul Raynor. Rocky road to debut HARRY HARRIS DAVID Rocastle will discover tonight whether he is a \\u00a32 million misfit or a potential European Cup match-winner, writes Harry Harris. Manager Howard Wilkinson's record purchase from Arsenal has yet to kick a ball in anger since his surprise switch from Highbury to Elland Road. Now Wilkinson admits he is tempted to call up Rocky to hit the German champions Stuttgart with a surprise selection. The nearest Rocastle has come to the Leeds team was sitting on the bench during last Sunday's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa. Wilkinson admitted: \\u2018I am keeping all my options open and I have been thinking about whether I should play Rocastle. \\u2018I know a lot of people are beginning to wonder why I paid \\u00a32 million for him. \\u2018But I can only pick my best eleven at the time.\\u2019 IRON MAN ANDY IAN GIBB ANDY HOLLIGAN produced an Aintree iron of a left-hook to knock out Manchester's Tony Ekubia in 31 seconds of the seventh round at the Everton Sports Centre last night. Liverpool's Holligan retained his British and Commonwealth light-welterweight titles after barely outpointing the brave Manchester man in the same ring to win the title 15 months ago. Just when it looked as though Holligan would struggle, while being watched by his world featherweight champion pal Paul Hodkinson, he pulled out the big one. A left-hook hurt Ekubia in the sixth round, and then another put him down for a count of nine. But Holligan wasted no time in the seventh and an even better left-hook stretched Ekubia on his back to earn the Liverpool lad a Lonsdale Belt. New boost for hero Nigel TED MACAULEY LABATT'S, the brewery giants who pour millions into Williams, joined the clamour for Nigel Mansell's recall yesterday. Managing director John Eckmire said: \\u2018It's our wish that Frank and Nigel should re-open discussions and that the prospect of Nigel's premature retirement will vanish.\\u2019 Mirror Sport's phone lines were jammed with angry fans venting their rage at their hero's enforced retirement. One irate caller promised: \\u2018If I was down to my last spoonful of petrol, with a hundred miles still to go, I'd drive past an Elf station.\\u2019 French petrol suppliers Elf partner Renault as principal sponsors of the \\u00a325 million-a-year team. Another caller raged: \\u2018I've cancelled my Renault. They can stick it. If this is the way they want to treat Nigel, they can suffer the consequences. And I'll bet I'm not the only one.\\u2019 Labatt's don't want to get caught up in what could be a damaging commercial kickback. Eckmire, anxious to be seen to be supportive of the departing champion, added: \\u2018Our sponsorship position has always assumed that Nigel would be driving for Williams next year and we echo the British public's sentiments.\\u2019 WHY MANSELL HAD TO GO \\u2014 Pages 26, 27  SUPPORT: Mansell KING OF THE TIPSTERS NEWSBOY rounded off a brilliant nap hand yesterday when Jdaayel romped home at 4-1 for his fifth winning nap on the trot. The King of the Tipsters has been in unstoppable form since he struck with another 4-1 shot, Pursuit Of Love, at Doncaster last week. It's been winners all the way with Green Lane 9-2, Mellotlie 13-2 and Seaside Minstrel 100-30. To put the icing on the cake, Newsboy \\u2014 that's Charles Fawcus (left)\\u2014 weighed in with a 29-1 double yesterday through Jdaayel and Our Rita (5-1). He also gave 13-2 shot Highland Fantasy and King's Signet (3-1). FAWCUS: In top form LICKED Ex postman sends Spurs crashing COVENTRY 1 TOTTENHAM 0 DAVID MOORE EX-POSTMAN John Williams, Coventry's \\u00a3250,000 bargain buy from Swansea, made Spurs look second class last night. The lanky 24-year-old grabbed Coventry's winner after 61 minutes. And that followed his special delivery at White Hart Lane last month, when he netted twice in a 2-0 Coventry win. Williams' goal lifted the Sky Blues to second place in the Premier League \\u2014 and punters can get 1,000-1 on a Norwich-Coventry one-two at the end of the season. Doug Livermore, Tottenham's team boss, was left moaning: \\u2018We will be glad to see the back of Williams, that's for sure. \\u2018The lad was in non-League football little more than 12 months ago. He has shot up and seized his chance with both hands. Good luck to him.\\u2019 But Livermore insisted: \\u2018We had no luck at all, particularly when Neil Ruddock had what looked like a perfectly good header disallowed after half-an-hour. \\u2018We worked hard, defended well and surely deserved some reward for our efforts. \\u2018There were periods when we gained control. But a couple of errors crept in and we allowed Coventry to take the lead.\\u2019 The Williams breakthrough came when Lee Hurst's pass sent Peter Ndlovu racing at Tottenham's defence. He fired a drive which looped crazily off Pat van den Hauwe's heel. Williams leaped for a header which dropped over Ian Walker and just under the bar \\u2014 with the keeper finding he had taken one step too many off his line. Williams said: \\u2018For a moment I thought the header was going over. But then I saw the keeper struggling. It could have gone anywhere.\\u2019 Ruddock's goal was ruled out by referee Martin Bodenham, because Teddy Sheringham was pushing Andy Pearce. Ruddock himself, back from a one-match ban after being sent off against Crystal Palace, was blameless as he met a Vinny Samways cross to beat Steve Ogrizovic. But Ruddock enjoyed his own share of good fortune later, escaping punishment for what looked  suspiciously like an elbow in the face that flattened Ndlovu. Centre The skipper was often at the centre of the action, saving Spurs early in the second-half when Brian Borrows hesitated just six yards out with the goal at his mercy. With Manchester United due at White Hart Lane on Saturday, Tottenham's problems are made worse by a lengthening injury list which could soon reach crisis proportions. Livermore confirmed: \\u2018Four people were hurt \\u2014 Gray has a bad shin, Gordon Durie twisted an ankle, Sheringham hurt a knee and Samways sustained damaged ankle ligaments. \\u2018Samways is most doubtful for the week-end. We will need to patch the rest of them up.\\u2019 YOU AGAIN! JOHN Williams (centre) somehow gets in his header before the leaping Spurs defence \\u2014 and that meant his third goal against the Londoners this season. Mart's chance TED MACAULEY BRAVE Martin Brundle has emerged as favourite to replace Nigel Mansell in the Williams-Renault team. The Grand Prix world was rife with rumour last night that team boss Frank Williams will put him in the seat every top driver wants. Britain's former world sports car champion Brundle said last night: \\u2018I've heard the stories, but so far as I'm concerned they're just that \\u2014 stories and rumour. \\u2018I'm a free agent and like any other driver I'd love to be in the Williams.\\u2019 Mansell last night admitted he was considering driving in the infamous Indy sports car series in the USA \\u2014 despite fears about safety. DEATH WISH \\u2014 Page 30, 31  BRUNDLE: Favourite COTTEE POTTY! Wrad injury spoils Kendall's night Blackburn 2, Everton 3 KEN LAWRENCE HOWARD KENDALL'S discovery last night that Mark Ward could be out for the rest of the season with a broken leg spoilt a brilliant Tony Cottee-inspired performance at Ewood Park. Ward went down in agony following a challenge from Rovers' midfielder Mark Atkins, which produced a caution. The joy of Everton's win turned to depression when Kendall and his men returned to the dressing room still elated by their stunning victory. Goodison boss Kendall admitted: \\u2018Everybody is desperately disappointed for Mark. \\u2018He is a bubbly character and while he may not be a favourite of the Everton fans he is certainly a favourite among his team mates. \\u2018We don't know how long he will be out, but we will certainly miss him.\\u2019 Meanwhile, Kenny Dalglish was forced to re-live his bitterest memory as Cottee returned to haunt him. The Blackburn manager will never forget the night 18 months ago when Cottee scored two for Everton in the FA Cup fifth-round replay with Liverpool. The game ended as a 4-4 draw \\u2014 and Dalglish then stunned soccer by announcing his  retirement as Anfield boss. Cottee got two again last night \\u2014 returning after five months on the sidelines to stop Dalglish's \\u00a310million side striding to the top of the Premier League. And Dalglish must have gone into shock again as the side who have so far swept all before them suddenly surrendered their 100 per cent home record. Yet the mega-buck manager of Ewood could have had little complaint \\u2014 Rovers lost to a side who played revivalist football of a kind manager Howard Kendall has waited 22 months to see. Cottee, fit again after two knee operations, was the man who once more put the knife into Dalglish \\u2014 though the catalysts of Everton's thrilling victory were Robert Warzycha and the effervescent Peter Beardsley. Substitute Warzycha was forced on to the field after only ten minutes after Ward was stretchered off. And moments later more trouble hit Everton as Alan Shearer collected his seventh goal in eight games from the penalty spot. But Warzycha's arrival turned fate against Dalglish \\u2014 he was involved in all three Everton goals. Beardsley, meanwhile, produced a performance of such craft, guile and wisdom that it could yet make him the saviour of England manager Graham Taylor \\u2014 if only he would pick him. Cottee finished off the first of a series of classic Everton moves to grab the equaliser before John Ebbrell put them ahead at the break. Shearer, continuing his astonishing run since his \\u00a33.3m move from Southampton, put Rovers back on terms. But Everton were not to be denied, and they produced another brilliant move as Beardsley and Warzycha combined to allow Cottee a simple tap-in. Shocked Dalglish admitted: \\u2018Everton are the best footballing side we have faced all season.\\u2019 TONY'S TIME TONY Cottee (right) grabs the first of his two goals against Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn last night. Picture: ALBERT COOPER COTTEE POTTY IT WAS joy and despair for former West Ham stars Tony Cottee and Mark Ward as Everton scored a shock 3-2 win at Blackburn last night. Cottee, in his first match of the season after knee surgery, scored twice. His second was a brilliantly-worked winner nine minutes from time. But Ward was stretchered off with a broken leg after a challenge by Mark Atkins, who was booked for the tackle. But Everton manager Howard Kendall refused to be drawn by suggestions that the tackle was malicious. MATCH REPORT \\u2014 Page 25  COTTEE: Double joy MY HELL \\u2018They said I should have been killed in a crash\\u2019 COLIN PRICE HARRY REDKNAPP poured his broken heart out yesterday after being accused of inciting a mini-riot at Bristol City. \\u2018A fan behind the dug-out snarled at me and said I should have been killed along with my mate Brian Tiler and three others in a car smash,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I ask you, what kind of person says a vile thing like that over a football match?\\u2019 West Ham's first-team coach angrily refutes the charge that he made V-signs at the lout during the 5-1 victory. But he admits that his self-control snapped sufficiently for him to signal the score, 3-1 to West Ham. Avon and Somerset Police have summonsed Redknapp to appear in court to answer charges of alleged abusive conduct. Redknapp is determined to fight the charge but he is even more upset that his action was seen as the spark for crowd violence. \\u2018Honest to God, I put three fingers up on one hand and one finger on the other, smiled at him and then sat down,\\u2019 said Redknapp. \\u2018There was no V-sign at all. \\u2018A steward standing some 40 yards away rushed over and said he saw me making an obscene gesture. I was flabbergasted and so was my manager Billy Bonds. \\u2018I can't believe I am being blamed for a fight that went on in the stand behind us, and I hope video evidence will clearly back me up.\\u2019 Redknapp spent the best part of six months recovering from serious head and leg injuries after the horror crash near Rome involving a mini-bus in which he and ex-Aston Villa star Tiler were travelling. They were on their way to cheer England in the World Cup finals when the bus was in collision with a car. Tiler, Redknapp's managing director at Bournemouth, and three men travelling in the car were killed. Redknapp returned to West Ham during the summer. MIRROR SPORT yesterday Martin's fired up MARTIN RICHARDS THE Rugby League have mounted their biggest ever advertising campaign in London to promote the Stones Bitter World Cup final showdown between the Lions and the Kangaroos. The centre-piece is the world's costliest player, \\u00a3440,000 Wigan and Great Britain winger Martin Offiah. Officials are confident that \\u2014 with Offiah's help to lure the southern punters \\u2014 there will be a 78,000 Wembley full house next month \\u2014 a new world record for a Rugby League international. Said Rugby League public affairs executive David Howes: \\u2018Offiah was chosen because he is the greatest  personality in the game. He has a London background and great showbiz appeal. \\u2018Like goalscorers in soccer, the great try scorers are the heroes and the personalities. \\u2018He has an amazing try record since he came into the game into 1987 and is being compared with legends like Billy Boston and Brian Bevan. \\u2018And because of his unusual name there can be only one Martin Offiah.\\u2019 Advance ticket sales for the final have already broken the 50,000 barrier and are approaching a British Test record of 54,000, also set at Wembley in 1990. Great Britain have never won the World Cup but after this summer's titanic struggle for the Ashes and blessed with home advantage, Mal Reilly's men will never have a better chance to take the trophy. World champions Australia arrive on October 3 and play three warm-up games in Sheffield, Huddersfield and Workington. HANNON IN GOLD VENTURE CHARLES FAWCUS RICHARD HANNON is eyeing the gold in a bid to clinch his first ever trainer's title. Hannon is already \\u00a320,000 ahead of Michael Stoute and a win with Venture Capitalist in Saturday's \\u00a375,000 Ladbrokes Ayr Gold Cup would make him even harder to catch. \\u2018There aren't many harder races in the year, but they are making Lochsong favourite and I don't see why we should not beat her,\\u2019 said the Wiltshire trainer. \\u2018Venture Capitalist was just a neck behind Lochsong at Doncaster last week and he should have won. \\u2018He was nearly put out of the race when he ran into the back of Clifton Charlie who had broken a leg and yet he would have caught Lochsong in another couple of strides. \\u2018The horse seems to have improved since we put blinkers on him and he'll wear them at Ayr. \\u2018We are giving Stoutie a bit of a target already. It would be nice if we could stretch it.\\u2019 Jo N Jack, who landed a coup for Yorkshire punters when winning at 33-1 at Lingfield last week, is back in action at Beverley (4.00) today. Bleating bookies are still refusing to pay out on the bets while Bola make their inquiries. TAKEN FOR A RIDE Sponsors fear public backlash over Mansell Message for Nigel: \\u2018Don't quit\\u2019 TED MACAULEY BOARDROOMS right across Britain were buzzing yesterday with anxious debate about the shoddy Nigel Mansell affair. Sales of cars, lager, cigarettes, petrol and office equipment are all threatened and could be hit in an astonishing public backlash. And major sponsors of the Renault-Williams team, caught in the crossfire of the bitter battle between the world champion and his team boss Frank Williams, are in a panic. They want a finish to the feud\\u2026and a different ending. The message last night was: \\u2018Come back, Nigel. Don't quit!\\u2019 Their underlying feeling is that Frank Williams has blundered badly and they are saying: \\u2018What a mess he has made of it all!\\u2019 Army Williams has emerged as the unrelenting villain as he patrols what has turned into Fortress Didcot, the race-team HQ, refusing to enlighten the enraged Mansell army on the reasons for their split. He has become a target for abuse \\u2014 and powerful sponsors who back the team with around \\u00a320-\\u00a325million a year want a say in what has become the greatest sports outcry of all time. I conducted a round-up of the principals yesterday and without exception the big six want a say\\u2026and they want Mansell to reverse his decision to quit. The money men who keep Formula One afloat want to stave off commercial backlashes that could cost them millions of pounds and hard-earned goodwill. John Eckmire, managing director of Labatt's, the lager brewers who pump \\u00a32million into the team, said: \\u2018All the sponsors need to get together to get the two men talking again. \\u2018If I had a magic wand I would wave it and get Nigel back. But I'm not advocating a sponsors\\u2019 rebellion. \\u2018We are not basing our views on emotion, but on pure business. But I don't think we realised just what a hero Mansell is to the public. \\u2018We put a lot of money in and we want to maximise on our investment \\u2014 and Nigel, perfect for us, is a major part of our future. \\u2018I see no reason why he and Frank Williams can't get back together again. \\u2018We want him back.\\u2019 And that was the message from Camel, the cigarette company who put \\u00a33million a year behind Williams. Their spokesman, Richard Grundy, said: \\u2018It's all been handled very badly by Frank Williams. He's managed to turn a triumph into a public relations disaster. Caught \\u2018We've waited for years to have a Formula One world champion like Mansell \\u2014 and now it looks as though we won't be able to use him. \\u2018Unfortunately, we've been caught up in the crossfire and we've had people on to us saying they'll never smoke Camel cigarettes again. \\u2018But we'd just like them to know we are as terribly unhappy as they are.\\u2019 Renault, who supply the \\u00a3100,000 engines \\u2014 changed every 400 miles \\u2014 said: \\u2018We've already had a few people on to us saying they're not going to buy our cars. \\u2018We're very sorry and we'd do anything we could to get Nigel back and the situation restored.\\u2019 Major sponsors Elf, the French petrol suppliers with 800 filling stations in Britain, told me: \\u2018It's up to Frank Williams to sort it out. \\u2018We love Nigel. We think he's a hero and he's shown he's a brilliant driver. \\u2018Things might have been handled a bit better \\u2014 but it's between him and the team.\\u2019 Canon, the Japanese office equipment and electrical suppliers, who put in \\u00a35million a year, want Mansell and Williams to get together again. And a spokesman said: \\u2018We've expressed our concern already to Mr Williams. \\u2018Nigel has a fanatical following of loyal fans and we hope they don't try to hit our business. \\u2018No sponsor is happy about the possibility of his business being hit when he has done all he can. We are proud to have been supporters of him and the team. \\u2018So we just hope Nigel's supporters will be sensible.\\u2019 Champion sparkplugs spokesman Robin Longden said from the company headquarters on Merseyside: \\u2018We are having continuing dialogue with both Nigel and Frank Williams because everything in our advertising campaign for next year was geared around the two of them. \\u2018I'm optimistic there'll be a meeting of minds and it can all be resolved.\\u2019 Wave \\u2018There's been a massive wave of patriotism behind Nigel that is quite unbelievable \\u2014 and we just hope that there isn't any backlash from the public that will damage either the sport or sponsors.\\u2019 At Goodyear, who supply 2,000 tyres a season at \\u00a3350 a time, a spokesman told me: \\u2018Nigel is a character, a personality and a tremendous driver who does the sport a lot of good. \\u2018It's a tragedy that it looks as if he's quitting just when he's developed from being a superstar into an awesome megastar. \\u2018What worries us is that our sales could be affected because fingers of suspicion are being pointed at us.\\u2019 Putting his foot down NIGEL MANSELL insists his decision to quit is final, despite the outcry from the world champion's fans and the concern of the Renault-Williams sponsors MONDAY: Shocker Poles apart MANSELL and team boss Frank Williams failed to hammer out a deal MONDAY: Mirror Sport's verdict TUESDAY: Mansell's American offer My sacking hurt me, my family and my friends like hell PHIL THOMPSON ON THE CRISIS AT LIVERPOOL NEIL SILVER PHIL Thompson last night described the torment of his sacking by Liverpool. In a frank debate on the Anfield crisis on Sky TV Thompson, former Liverpool skipper and coach, told how his shock sacking had shattered his family. \\u2018It hurt me, it hurt my family and friends like hell,\\u2019 said Thompson. \\u2018And I've not been given a good reason for it.\\u2019 Thompson was backed by former hard-man Liverpool colleague Tommy Smith, who said Thompson should have been given a medal for what he did at Anfield, not the sack. Here is the amazing transcript of the debate, on The Footballers' Football Show, which also included Liverpool community liaison officer Brian Hall and former skipper Mark Lawrenson, and which was hosted by presenter Richard Keys. Debate We pick up the debate at the point where Hall suggests Liverpool boss Graeme Souness was under too much pressure to make rational decisions. BRIAN HALL: \\u2018At that particular moment in time we have a manager that has got himself into the semi-final of the FA Cup, he's got the opportunity of reaching Wembley, he's had a difficult time in the League, it's been a traumatic season okay, then he's told he needs triple by-pass surgery at the age of 39. \\u2018There aren't many people in the world that are actually going to make solid, rational decisions. I don't think so under those sort of circumstances.\\u2019 TOMMY SMITH: \\u2018So you're saying his decision to have this operation and to actually sell it to the Sun came all within five seconds?\\u2019 HALL: \\u2018No, what I'm saying Tommy is that Graeme has subsequently apologised, he's made apologies. I think we ought to make some understanding of the sort of pressures that the man was under at the time when all this happened, and it happened very quickly.\\u2019 PHIL THOMPSON: \\u2018So that mean's I get my job back does it?\\u2019 RICHARD KEYS: \\u2018We should explain that too. Phil, you were on the coaching staff and left in the summer. \\u2018I understand you've got a legal problem which means we can't go too deeply into that, but from the outside is it hurting you a little bit?\\u2019 THOMPSON: \\u2018It hurts like hell. Reasons for my dismissal were nothing like I think I deserved. I think it lies a little bit deeper.\\u2019 SMITH: \\u2018I think the lad deserved a medal, because they won the Cup with half a reserve side out last year \\u2014 and he was taking care of the reserves.\\u2019 THOMPSON: \\u2018All I've just said is that it was not a good enough explanation of what I got and I don't think anybody has been told, not only to the media out there, myself who is the most important one. \\u2018But it hurt me, my family and my friends like hell. And I've not had a good enough reason why \\u2014 that's all I'm hurting Brian, I don't think that is taking anything too far.\\u2019 KEYS: \\u2018Mark, somewhat distanced from it now, what's you're impression of what's happening at Anfield.\\u2019 MARK LAWRENSON: \\u2018I think the thing you have to say Richard, they've only played eight games. This has happened before and no matter what people say I think in my second year we were about 16th or 17th.\\u2019 KEYS: \\u2018But it is not just a question of what is going on on the park, it's what's happening elsewhere that we're beginning to hear and read about and that's never been the case at Liverpool previously, ever. LAWRENSON: \\u2018No but I honestly believe that there are certain members of the Press that are delighted to have a go at Liverpool because of the success that they've had. \\u2018They are a victim of their own success. It has been absolutely phenomenal, it really has, and now all of a sudden eight games into the season and we hear supposedly all of the stories. \\u2018How many games are there left? 34? You know, I don't think he (Souness) has been able to pick from all his players every week certainly probably for 18 months since he's been there. \\u2018So I think it is a bit early to pre-empt things.\\u2019 Souness was then accused of trying to run Liverpool on the same lines as an Italian club. SMITH: \\u2018Souness seems to be changing an awful lot. If he wants to do it his way and he succeeds then great, but so far it hasn't been that successful. \\u2018I know that Liverpool won the FA Cup \\u2014 thanks to Phil and his reserves, because most of the reserves were playing in most of the games last year with all the injuries. \\u2018There's a big question mark about how Liverpool train. They go on pasta diets now. If food's got anything to do with it then I must have been eating the wrong way for the last 40 years. \\u2018An awful lot of things are changing which is foreign to Anfield because it used to be a very friendly club.\\u2019 THOMPSON: \\u2018The thing with Bill Shankly was that we were always a family and everyone knew each other from the cleaning lady to the girls in the ticket office. It was something special.\\u2019 PHIL Thompson is still bitter at the way he was treated at Anfield. SMITH: \\u2018Thompson deserved medal\\u2019 LAWRENSON: \\u2018Too early to judge\\u2019 SOUNESS: Upset some Anfield fans Happy Gooch ENGLAND skipper Graham Gooch last night backed the decision to leave David Gower out of the winter tour to India and instead pick South African rebel Mike Gatting. Gooch said: \\u2018I agree with our policy to select two batsmen over 35. \\u2018Given that I was one of them it came down to a choice between Gower and Gatting. It was a marginal decision and I'm certainly not unhappy with it.\\u2019 He added that wicket keeper Jack Russell was left out because of his poor Test batting. VIV GRABS GOAL GLORY Anderson lifts Owls Sheffield Wed 8, Spora 1 JOHN EDWARDS VIV ANDERSON called on all his European know-how to help Sheffield Wednesday recover from the shock of their lives last night. Humble Spora arrived at Hillsborough with a reputation as one of the tiniest of this season's European minnows. They attract crowds of 450 for their home matches in the Luxembourg league and brought 26 fans with them for this UEFA Cup first round tie. But that didn't stop them reducing Hillsborough to a stunned silence by answering Chris Waddle's eighth-minute opener with an equaliser two minutes later. Ricco Cardoni robbed Peter Shirtliff and set up Joao Cruz for a simple finish that had Spora's fans \\u2014 all 26 of them \\u2014 dancing with delight. That followed Waddle's first goal for Wednesday, a low left-foot drive from 20 yards. And it left Wednesday rattled until veteran campaigner Anderson took charge midway through the first-half. The 36-year-old defender \\u2014 who won European Cup medals with Nottingham Forest in 1979 and 1980 \\u2014 restored Wednesday's lead with a header from Waddle's 22nd-minute cross. And he struck again in the 29th minute, chesting down a Trevor Francis cross and firing past the keeper from 12 yards. Wednesday completed a burst of three goals in nine minutes to go 4-1 up. Carlton Palmer sent make-shift striker Paul Warhurst clear in the 31st minute for an explosive finish that finally removed any Wednesday anxiety. Curling The vastly-experienced trio of Francis, Anderson and Waddle \\u2014 with 105 years and four European Cup finals between them \\u2014 were beginning to revel in the huge open spaces left by their part-time opponents. And Francis almost made it five on the stroke of half-time, cutting in from the right and curling a left-foot shot just wide. Wednesday kept up the relentless pressure after the break and Chris Bart-Williams made it five in the 61st minute. Nigel Worthington and Warhurst  added to the drubbing with two more goals. And Bart-Williams rounded off the thrashing in the 81st minute. FRANCIS: Exp[erienced WADDLE: Scored IT'S RUSH HOUR! Champ-Ian slams four to storm past Hunt's record Super Reds in a Euro romp Liverpool 6, A Limassol 1 RICHARD TANNER JUBILANT Ian Rush was crowned Liverpool's European goal king at Anfield last night. The Welsh ace bagged four goals in this Cup-Winners' Cup romp to eclipse Sixties' idol Roger Hunt. Rush now has 19 in European competition compared to Hunt's 17. And last night's haul puts him just one behind Hunt's all-time Liverpool scoring record of 285. Rush, without a Premier League goal this season, took all his pent-up frustration out on the unfortunate Cypriots. And after scoring four for the first time in a European game, he said: \\u2018I'm proud and privileged to break such a great player's record. Hunt was my dad's hero. He was a big Liverpool fan in the Sixties and we called him Sir Roger. \\u2018Hunt is a legend here but if I go on and beat his all-time record I think it'll take some bettering. \\u2018It's been hard going for us all in the League, but hopefully this result will help bring back the confidence.\\u2019 Rush's club landmark came just a week after he had reached a scoring milestone for his country. Drive His World Cup hat-trick for Wales against the Faroe Islands took his international tally to 23 and brought him level with Ivor Allchurch and Trevor Ford. While Rush ended the night as the hero it was Paul Stewart who got Liverpool going. Danish star Torben Piechnik, who will complete a \\u00a3500,000 move to Anfield today from FC Copenhagen, had hardly settled into his seat before Stewart made the vital early breakthrough in the fourth minute. Pushed up front by Souness to partner Rush, the former Spurs star showed he had lost none of his old striking instincts by evading two challenges and firing a rising drive high into the net after robbing Apollon's Scottish exile Dave Kenny. Liverpool enjoyed almost total domination but faced with a team who pulled all 11 players back behind the ball they had to wait until the 38th minute before adding their second. This time Stewart ran in unmarked at the far post to score with a downward header from Jan Molby's free kick. The Rush show began a minute later when Mike Marsh wriggled his way into space in the penalty area before Rush rifled in a 10-yard chance. Apollon didn't help their cause when they had Marios Charalambous sent off for a second bookable offence a minute before the break. Rush completed a quick-fire hat-trick within 10 minutes of the second half starting \\u2014 and he owed it to Mark Walters. In the 50th minute he produced an instinctive finish from six yards after Walters had driven in a fierce low cross. And five  minutes later he stooped low to head his third after overworked keeper Mikalis Christophi had only managed to push out a curling effort by Walters. The sixth came in the 74th minute with Rush pouncing to punish Christophi again after he had failed to hold another Jamie Redknapp shot. Surprise Apollon grabbed a surprise consolation goal seven minutes from time when Marsh upended Pampos Pittas and Yugoslav international Malenko Spoliaric converted the spot kick. That denied David James the distinction of his first clean-sheet for Liverpool, but it will hardly raise Apollon's hopes of a fight-back in Limassol in a fortnight's time. Only 12,769 watched the game \\u2014 Liverpool's second lowest in their 23 seasons of European soccer. STRIKE IT RICH IAN RUSH slots home his fourth goal against Limassol last night to make him Anfield's European goal king. EURO HELL FOR JOHN Leeds in shock Stuttgart 3 Leeds 0 HARRY HARRIS LEEDS' bid for European Cup glory struck disaster last night. Keeper John Lukic was beaten three times in the second half and they now face a giant task in the second leg of this first round tie. And Eric Cantona's night ended in misery. The Frenchman's exceptional talents might have been rewarded with two goals in the first half here in the Neckarstadion. But after the interval the striker pulled up with a hamstring strain, signalled to the bench to come off \\u2014 and then gave the ball away and set up Stuttgart's vital opening goal. The whole tie turned from Leeds' grasp in that fateful moment the Frenchman will want to forget. His first injury in English football could not have come at a worst time. As he tried to leave the field the ball suddenly dropped at his feet and he attempted a long-range crossfield pass aimed at Gordon Strachan. The Germans cut it out and ruthlessly exploited the possession as dangerous winger Ludwig Kogl crossed along the ground. Centre back Chris Whyte slipped and top goalscorer Fritz Walter expertly chipped over the advancing Lukic for the 63rd-minute opening strike. That was a cruel blow for Howard Wilkinson's team, who had made a committed, controlled and commanding start. Instead they fell apart when the German champions went ahead, and Walter collected his second within five minutes. A long-range effort from Eyjolfur Sverrisson was parried by Lukic and Walter demonstrated his predatory instincts ruthlessly inside the box. Then, with Leeds still hopeful of prising an away goal to take back to Elland Road, they were caught out on the break with Andreas Buch beating Lukic with an angled shot into a corner eight minutes from time. It could have been so vastly different for Leeds and Cantona. But instead of the Leeds fans celebrating with their new sing-song \\u2018Ooh Ah, Cantona\\u2019 it was \\u2018Oh no, Cantona\\u2019. Firing blanks LEE CHAPMAN and his Leeds team-mates couldn't break down the Stuttgart defence as they began their European campaign in Germany last night BACK ON TOP CHARLES FAWCUS CHAMPION apprentice Darryll Holland is a winner again \\u2014 and that's good news for boss Barry Hills as well as his jockey. With the Hills team poleaxed by a virus, this season had proved a real struggle for Darryll until his win on 25-1 chance Knifebox a week ago. He set off for Ayr yesterday with five more under his belt and promptly won the first three races, two in photos. \\u2018It's amazing what happens when your luck changes. I had to be patient and wait for the tide to turn,\\u2019 he said. Typical of his new found fortune was his win on Bandoline. Two weeks ago he forgot to weigh in when second at Haydock on the horse and was fined \\u00a3315. By coincidence his Ladbrokes Ayr Gold Cup ride tomorrow is Cantoris. Darryll was suspended for his ride on the horse last month \\u2014 at Haydock! Hills is just as relieved that the nightmare is over. \\u2018I wouldn't like to go through another summer like this one. \\u2018Some of the three-year-olds have never recovered, but the two-year-olds are looking good,\\u2019 said Barry who runs promising Bawaeth at Newbury today. Job horse Jo N Jack failed to land any touches at Beverley yesterday, finishing way out of the money behind No Comebacks. It's unlikely that losing punters will get their money back! CASH IN Eubank aims for earning power IAN GIBB THE way forward for WBO super-middleweight champion Chris Eubank should now be clear enough \\u2014 as long as he beats highly-rated American Tony Thornton in tomorrow's Daily Mirror-sponsored fight in Glasgow. With old foe Nigel Benn favoured to take the WBC version of the title from Italy's Mauro Galvano on October 3, the two champions could afford to forget their squabbles fighting for a mountain of cash. Forget it. I believe Eubank is already planning another defence before Christmas and Benn's name doesn't come near the list. If anything, the two men are further apart than ever \\u2014 even if a clash between them is one of three domestic battles that fight fans want to see \\u2014 the others being Lennox Lewis against Frank Bruno and Paul Hodkinson against Colin McMillan. When I asked Eubank if Benn had crossed his mind recently, it drew a cold response. He said: \\u2018No. Here is a man who antagonised me and bothered me for 16 months and when I said \\u2018yes\\u2019 to fighting him again, he said \\u2018no\\u2019. \\u2018What am I to do? He's not being true to the man he is.\\u2019 Eubank is certainly showing no great interest in trying to unify the title, possibly starting against WBA holder Michael Nunn. He said of the American stylist: \\u2018I'm not interested in him. He doesn't mean anything to me. \\u2018If my intention was to become famous worldwide, it would mean something to me to unify the titles. \\u2018But my intention is to make money and I'm doing that rather well with the WBO.\\u2019 The Brighton fighter strolled into a Glasgow press conference this week resplendent in light suit, bow tie and carrying a briefcase \\u2014 a new slant on the old line about taking care of business. And he knows there will be plenty of business to occupy him against Thornton. Eubank admitted: \\u2018From what I can make out, this will be a good fight \\u2014 unfortunately for me, because I like to get the job over and done with and go home with the minimum of fuss.\\u2019 BENN: No deal IT'S MINE: Eubank takes Benn's title, November 1990. POUNDING: Chris Eubank's goal is big money. ANDERS AGONY Top Gunner's fight for glory LIMPAR GETS SWEDE BASHED FRANK WIECHULA ANDERS LIMPAR was warned last night that his international career is in jeopardy if he keeps missing out on matches with Arsenal. Swedish chief Tommy Svensson declared: \\u2018If Anders doesn't play for his club for some time then it's going to be very difficult for me to pick him. \\u2018We need the player to be playing matches and be in form. I just hope it all clears up.\\u2019 It's the latest twist in the lengthy club versus country row which has simmered for the last two seasons. In the past, the exciting forward has opted to play for Sweden and lost out on his club place afterwards. Now, in an ironic reverse, being kept in the cold at Highbury could cost him his international place. Limpar hasn't figured for the Gunners since scoring the opening goal in the 2-0 win at Anfield on August 23. He's played twice for his country in that spell, against Norway and Finland, but not for Arsenal. Now he's in line to miss his sixth successive club game at Sheffield United tomorrow. Arsenal boss George Graham is annoyed that it took so long for him to be told about Limpar's current ankle injury. The Swede had played in his country's World Cup qualifier against Finland, but the injury wasn't reported until Limpar rejoined Arsenal last Friday. Graham said the Swedish FA should have had the courtesy to inform him. But Svensson said: \\u2018When Anders left Finland on Thursday he had no problems with his ankle. \\u2018I did not know he was injured. When he was back in London, he felt something. It's surprised me.\\u2019 WOUNDED HERO: Anders Limpar's ankle injury has left Arsenal boss George Graham fuming \\u2014 and now his Sweden career is on the line too. Good golly Ollie! SPANISH golf ace Jose-Maria Olazabal grumbled yesterday after taking the lead in the Lancome Trophy in Paris with a first-round five-under-par 65. Olazabal, 26, shot five birdies and a superb eagle but said: \\u2018My game is just not there. It is only 50 per cent at present. \\u2018It has happened to me before but this is the longest period. \\u2018I am practising hard to try to find the answer and I am playing in several events in the next few weeks and hope it comes right.\\u2019 Nick Faldo, chasing his fourth successive European tour win, laughed and said: \\u2018I'm happy enough with my par 70. \\u2018But Ollie is very young. When he is 10 years older he will be happy with 65 every time.\\u2019 Olazabal is just one shot ahead of Ian Woosnam, Barry Lane, Spaniard Jose-Manuel Carriles, and Argentinians Vicente Fernandez and Eduardo Romero. Dave sings Blues FRANK WIECHULA DEFIANT Dave Beasant last night spoke for the first time since his week-end goalkeeping torment and insisted: \\u2018I still want to play for Chelsea.\\u2019 Beasant has been to hell and back since he was publicly blamed by manager Ian Porterfield for Saturday's 3-2 home defeat by Norwich, and was told he was finished at the club. Chelsea have been actively looking for a replacement. But brave Dave has broken his silence and is ready to play in Sunday's live televised match at Manchester City. He said: \\u2018I'm still employed by Chelsea and no matter what the manager has said, I'll be wanting to play on Sunday. \\u2018I've been in the game a long time and you don't last forever. But you don't play over 500 games with three big clubs, have a couple of big moves and become a bad player overnight. \\u2018I've still got belief in myself and I still have confidence in my own ability.\\u2019 Beasant, who still has 18 months of his contract to run, has a chance of playing on Sunday. Chelsea's other senior keeper, Kevin Hitchcock, is struggling to recover from injury, and the club have until midday today to sort out a new signing. BEASANT: Determined Fozzie staying WEST Ham defender Colin Foster yesterday turned down a \\u00a3425,000 move to crisis club Nottingham Forest. Brian Clough, whose side are bottom of the Premier League after six successive defeats, wanted Fozzie back \\u2014 three years after selling him to West Ham for \\u00a3750,000. NO JOKING, IT'S STEVE STEVE Martin, Featherstone's new Aussie coach, is a shrewd man. He could be in the right place at the right time when top jobs come up for grabs next summer. Wigan's John Monie, Darryl Van de Velde at Castleford and St Helens' Mike McClennan are in the final year of their contracts. Martin will in the running. Come in, David MARTIN RICHARDS HALIFAX are ready to resurrect the career of Wigan's out-of-favour Great Britain winger David Myers. The championship leaders have contacted Wigan chairman Jack Robinson about the \\u00a3120,000tagged Myers, who has lost his senior place since the arrival of Martin Offiah. Myers upset coach John Monie by demanding a move when Wigan came back from the Sydney Sevens last February. He had promised Monie he would wait until the end of the season before discussing his future. \\u2018He and John haven't been able to strike up an amicable relationship since and David doesn't seem to figure in the coach's plans,\\u2019 said chairman Robinson. \\u2018If Halifax come back with a decent offer we'll consider it. David is listed at \\u00a3120,000 but you have to be flexible.\\u2019 Halifax are pulling out all the stops to try to strengthen their squad and want a sponsor to help fund a deal for Aussie Test forward Bob Lindner. Salford face strong competition from an un-named Yorkshire club in their bid to sign Leeds former All Black star John Gallagher. The stumbling block to any deal is a cash settlement for the remainder of Gallagher's contract, worth a reported \\u00a3400,000 when he signed for Leeds in the summer of 1990. Leigh are set to advertise for a player-coach to succeed Jim Crellin, who quit last Sunday. CARRY ON GARRY ALEX MURPHY/MARTIN RICHARDS GARRY SCHOFIELD must keep the Great Britain captaincy for next month's World Cup final against Australia. And there has to be a big question mark as to whether Ellery Hanley is effective enough to be offered even a playing role in the Wembley showdown. It will be a real kick in the teeth for Schofield if he has to make way for Hanley again as Britain's captain \\u2014 no matter what the set-up is at Leeds. And there'll be uproar in Wigan if the classy Phil Clarke has to give up his No.13 jersey for Hanley. I watched Hanley on TV against St Helens and Halifax and he looks to have lost the pace and mobility to close down players going away from him. Saints' Allan Hunte went past him with ease and Hanley was caught out several times in midfield in the Halifax match. Aussie scrum half Allan Langer is playing out of his skin at the moment and if \\u2018Alfie\\u2019 controls the open spaces at Wembley, it will be curtains. For that reason I'll be happier to see Clarke in midfield \\u2014 and a lot of Aussies would agree. Don't get me wrong. This is not another knocking piece on Hanley, who has been a great player for club and country. I'm just being realistic. There's a school of thought that Hanley should be given a spot on the bench and brought on in a game-breaking role. That's worth considering. But the right selection is vital for this game. It's a great opportunity to win the World Cup for the first time since 1972. Schofield was an inspirational leader in this summer's Ashes tour when he took over from the injured Hanley and he played the game of his life in the second Test win in Melbourne. He is a first-rate professional who's popular with his fellow players and the media. There was an amusing moment when Schofield talked enthusiastically to the press after the Melbourne win and a British journalist pleaded: \\u2018Slow down Garry, I can't get all this down!\\u2019 By contrast, Hanley is not comfortable with the press and a good media profile is vital with the World Cup final being heavily promoted in London. CLARKE: Should play HANLEY: Lost form MAN FOR THE JOB GARRY Schofield played the game of his life when he led Britain to victory in the second Ashes Test in Melbourne. BIGG BUY BOLTON are set to break their transfer record by splashing \\u00a3500,000 on Stoke striker Wayne Biggins. Manager Bruce Rioch wants to link Biggins, 28 goals last season, with the equally prolific ex-Celtic player Andy Walker. KENNY GOES DANISH KEN LAWRENCE KENNY Dalglish is poised to bring in a Danish defender to make up for the disappointment of losing \\u00a32.5 million Craig Short. The big-spending Blackburn manager watched Glasgow Rangers play Lyngby on Wednesday and his eyes were firmly fixed on right back Henrik Risom. Dalglish had Risom training at Ewood Park last year but did not pursue matters. However, Lyngby are ready to part with the Danish international as soon as their interest in the European Cup is over \\u2014 and following Rangers 2-0 win that is likely to be in 10 days time. Dalglish, who has already spent more than \\u00a310 million, will have to pay \\u00a3500,000 if Risom arrives at Ewood Park. DALGLISH: New target Bjorn again Dane MATT HUGHES DANISH international Bjorn Kristensen yesterday staked his claim for a First Division recall at Newcastle United. Kristensen, a star of United's Anglo-Italian 2-2 draw at Grimsby on Wednesday, insisted: \\u2018I reminded a few people that I'm still around.\\u2019 Manager Kevin Keegan was delighted by Kristensen's form as the 28-year-old tasted 90 minutes of first-team action for the first time in more than a year. Keegan said: \\u2018Bjorn was terrific and adapted to the pace of the game very well.\\u2019 Kristensen, who missed most of last season through injury, won't break into the side for tomorrow's match against Bristol City at St James's Park. But he added: \\u2018I'm a happy man. The last few months have been frustrating, so it was nice to be in action again. \\u2018There wasn't a big crowd at Grimsby, but the atmosphere was 400 per cent better than in the reserves.\\u2019 KRISTENSEN LAMBGATE UMPIRE SACKED OSLEAR'S LEFT IN THE COLD CHRIS LANDER DON OSLEAR has been sacked in the middle of cricket's great ball-tampering scandal. The blunt-talking Yorkshireman has been voted out as chairman of the Umpires' Association by his fellow pros. And this could be a major blow for Oslear and colleagues Ken Palmer and John Hampshire, the men at the centre of the ball-changing drama. The fact that Oslear has been stripped of his position as the umpires' boss at their annual meeting, means that Palmer, Hampshire and the England team now fear Allan Lamb's sensational Daily Mirror revelations may never be backed by cricket's dithering chiefs at the Test and County Cricket Board. Oslear, a one-time Grimsby stevedore, had privately put pressure on the International Cricket Council to confirm Lamb's claim that the Pakistanis tampered with the ball during the one-day match at Lord's nearly a month ago. Dossier Oslear produced a 2,000-word dossier recording all that happened from the moment that Lamb and England manager Micky Stewart lodged complaints about the state of the ball at lunchtime. Oslear was determined to see the truth told about the ball-tampering. But for his pains he was was given a private roasting by a TCCB official. This official was furious when it appeared that Oslear had spoken to media men about his determination to back Palmer and Hampshire, as well as Lamb, the only England cricketer who has had the courage to take on the cricket establishment. Now Oslear is wondering if the truth will ever come out \\u2014 especially as ICC supremo Sir Colin Cowdrey has failed to comment on match referee Deryck Murray's report and on the umpires' official findings. The Umpires' Association had planned to table a motion giving an official vote of support for Lamb. But this was shelved when Oslear was deposed as chairman. An umpire told me: \\u2018What's happened to Don was no reflection on his unswerving attempt to get the truth told over everything that went on at Lord's. \\u2018But, sadly, this may take the pressure off the ICC and the TCCB and many of their officials who seem embarrassed \\u2014 as though they would have preferred Lamb not to have rocked the boat.\\u2019 But last night other umpires stressed that Oslear had not been sacked as chairman because of his battle to support Lamb. One senior umpire said: \\u2018Don not being voted back as chairman had absolutely nothing to do with the uproar about the ball-changing. \\u2018The umpires are simply determined to have an independent chairman who can fight for us on contractual and legal matters. \\u2018We are the only full-time professional umpiring body in the world. We believe we are undervalued and there is a feeling that we get kicked around.\\u2019 The umpires are calling for their new chairman to be Roy Kerslake, a Taunton lawyer and a former Somerset cricketer. CHOICE LAMB ALLAN LAMB sparked a storm with his revelations OSLEAR was voted out by his fellow umpires LAST Friday's Back Page RUSHIE RECORD RICHARD TANNER IAN RUSH moved within one goal of Roger Hunt's all-time scoring record of 285 goals for Liverpool with a four-goal spree in the 6-1 Cup-Winners' Cup thrashing of Apollon Limassol. Rush took his European tally to 19, smashing Anfield legend Hunt's 17-goal Euro record for the club. Paul Stewart scored Liverpool's first two goals against the hapless Cypriots, who had Marios Charalambrous sent off. Paul Warhurst, Sheffield Wednesday's make-shift striker, was rushed to hospital with a serious head injury sustained while scoring in the 8-1 win over Spora. MATCH REPORTS \\u2014 P 46, 47  RUSH: Four-timer MANSELL SIGNS FOR INDY Newman's sting for Williams TED MACAULEY NIGEL MANSELL has sensationally signed to race in America next year in the killer-car Indy series. I can exclusively reveal that Britain's Grand Prix hero last night secretly agreed to a multi-million-pound link-up with film star Paul Newman's red-hot team. World champion Mansell, at loggerheads with Grand Prix team boss Frank Williams, finally snapped and turned his back on Formula One. He will be paid around \\u00a33million \\u2014 the same wage he was offered in a cut-price deal by Renault-Williams. An informed insider told me last night: \\u2018It is absolutely certain that Nigel has done the deal. I understand he finalised it all today.\\u2019 Mansell, 39, is still young by Indy standards, where drivers compete and win well into their fifties. He has been pursued all year by race fan Newman and his Chicago business partner Carl Haas. Indycar racing holds no fears for the brave Brummie, even though it is a notorious killer with spectacular crashes in cars belting around oval tracks at 240mph. Even as the clamour grows for Mansell to reverse his decision to quit, the public hero has decided to give it a go in America. One of the attractions about Indycar racing is that Mansell will not have to cross the world in wearying pursuit of Grand Prix glory. He'll be able to return to his Florida oceanside home in just a couple of hours. But it must have taken some sweet talking from Newman to persuade Mansell's wife Rosanne to agree. Earlier in the year Mansell told me that Indycar racing fascinated him \\u2014 and he would relish its new challenge. That is just what he'll get \\u2014 with every wild car racer desperate to humiliate the Limey champ. Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone told me: \\u2018Yes, it is true. Nigel has told me that he's going to go Indycar racing.\\u2019 Ecclestone, president of the Formula One Constructors Association, had pleaded with him not to do it and added: \\u2018I'm frightened for him. \\u2018A crash finished Nelson Piquet \\u2014 and I wouldn't want the same to happen to Nigel. He's an old friend.\\u2019 WARNING: Tuesday's Mirror MANSELL: Racing in America next year BLOW ME! This ref can play Steve spot on  HARRY HARRIS STEVE BAINES, an ex-pro footballer with more than 600 matches behind him, is hoping to lead a revolution. He is quietly working his way to the top as a referee \\u2014 and he is just 18 months away from landing his first League fixture. He believes he can be the man to change the face of referring for the better. Baines turned out for seven League clubs, chiefly Huddersfield, Bradford City, Walsall, Scunthorpe and Chesterfield. Then he was inspired by two famous hard men, Ron Harris and Tommy Smith, who insisted that football needed ex-players as referees. Agree The players' union agree. They are itching to hold up the red card to an establishment that doesn't believe that ex-pros have the right pedigree to control top matches. The PFA describe Baines as a guinea pig. If he is successful, the FA will no longer be able to ignore the clamour for ex-pros. Baines told me: \\u2018Reg Matthewson played a couple of matches for Bolton before becoming a referee. But I want to be the first man to achieve Football League status after a full playing career. \\u2018In my first season I was referee-of-the-year in Chesterfield. I'm now in my fifth season. \\u2018I'm running the line in the Conference and the Pontins leagues. Depending on how this season goes, I could be running the line in the League next season and taking control of a League game the following year.\\u2019 Baines' playing career was terminated by arthritis in the neck. Now he has become a pain in the neck to the establishment. He says: \\u2018They do keep moving the goalposts. I have had some problems. \\u2018They don't really want somebody with my background, even though they say they do. \\u2018It does help for a referee to have played the game. I can tell what's going to happen before it happens. I've done it myself.\\u2019 Two unhappy managers, George Graham and Terry Venables, have told players' union leader Gordon Taylor they are angry at  refereeing standards. A summit \\u2014 a gathering of referees, managers and the PFA \\u2014 will take place \\u2018in the next few weeks\\u2019. Graham and Venables have been sniping at refereeing but have been unable to declare publicly their full outrage for fear of FA disrepute charges. Graham says: \\u2018We were assured that we would have the top 20 referees in the country taking charge of our games. But I'd like to see that list.\\u2019 The PFA's Taylor supports the move to publish a list of referees, as assessed by managers, and for only the top 20 to officiate in the Premier League. STEVE BAINES proudly holds up a medal he won as a player \\u2014 and one he has collected as a referee. MAN IN CHARGE: Baines By HARRY HARRIS  STEVE BAINES proudly holds up a medal he won as a player \\u2014 and one he has collected as a referee. MAN IN CHARGE: Baines \\u2018BEAST\\u2019 CAGED Kiwi recruit out as Leeds battle MARTIN RICHARDS FRUSTRATED Leeds have been wounded by two more injury blows as they bid to kick-start their season with a win over Hull KR tomorrow. New Kiwi centre signing Kevin \\u2018The Beast\\u2019 Iro, who flew in on Thursday, has been caged because of a damaged ankle which will keep him out of action for a fortnight. And a hamstring injury has put skipper Ellery Hanley out of the starting line-up against Rovers. Leeds, who have lost their two opening championship games, are already without second rower Gary Mercer and Iro's former Wigan team-mate Andy Gregory. \\u2018The best Ellery can hope for is a place on the bench,\\u2019 said manager Doug Laughton. Aggravated The 24-year-old Iro picked up the injury playing against Great Britain in the second Test in Auckland in July and aggravated it in his last match for Manly three weeks ago. Ex-Wigan favourite Iro was looking on the bright side yesterday. \\u2018Leeds were always at the back of my mind as the side I would like to join if I came back to England,\\u2019 said the 6ft 2in, 16 stone Iro. \\u2018It's a new-look team but has the players to be very successful. \\u2018This is a great opportunity for me. One of the main factors in my coming here was the chance to play outside such great players as Garry Schofield and Andy Gregory. \\u2018I always got a great service from Andy at Wigan. \\u2018The English game is a lot more open than the Sydney competition which is a little stereotyped with defence being the main part of the game.\\u2019 After his record-breaking exploits with Wigan, Iro didn't strike gold in his two years at Manly. \\u2018My form was up and down at Manly but so was the form of the team. We won 10 and lost 10 this season.\\u2019 Iro, who holds the Wembley try scoring record with six tries in a total of four Challenge Cup final appearances with Wigan, is aiming to go back again in a Leeds jersey. \\u2018Wigan are a high profile side and so are Leeds and I certainly wouldn't mind a trip back to Wembley,\\u2019 he added. Laughton commented: \\u2018Kevin is a class act who's proved his worth in the English game. He's a big man who can score tries and make the ball available to his winger.\\u2019 Laughton had to spend time at Iro's press conference fending off questions about Leeds' next targets. He denied he'd talked to props Ian Lucas of Wigan and Castleford's Dave Sampson. \\u2018There are no forward signings under review. We can't stop clubs linking us with their players. \\u2018We've been linked with Dean Sampson but I have not spoken to the player. \\u2018And there has been no approach to Wigan over Lucas \\u2014 yet!\\u2019 Laughton added that speculation about John Gallagher leaving Headingley sounded as though the player's agent was doing all the talking. Wigan chairman Jack Robinson last night said that tour prop Lucas was one player he definitely didn't want to lose. The unsettled Lucas, who wants regular first team football, is on the bench for tomorrow's trip to Wakefield. But Robinson said: \\u2018Ian is a bit down after the tour and I think once he gets a couple of senior games under his belt things will work out.\\u2019 OH BLOW! Leeds' new signing Kiwi Kevin Iro will be only be a spectator at tomorrow's game due to an ankle injury. HIGH WIRE SWINGERS Hull 14 pts Warrington 29 SUPER Warrington wrecked Hull's bid to go to the top of the Stones Bitter Championship. Greg Mackey \\u2014 the Australian stand-off who turned down Hull's contract offer last month to re-join Warrington \\u2014 and Welsh scrum half Kevin Ellis were at the heart of the Wire's classy, high speed football. Intense pressure was rewarded after 13 minutes when prop Neil Harmon produced the perfect pass for Rob Myler to score, Chris Rudd adding the goal. Then Mackey re-gathered his own kick to put in Rick Thackray. Two Paul Eastwood penalties against one to Rudd gave Hull a glimmer of hope. But it was snuffed out just before half-time when hooker Duane Mann seized on a Rob Nolan error to score. Mackey turned the screw in the second half with a drop goal, and then brilliant handling ended with Ellis kicking to the corner for Neil Kenyon to go over. Dean Busby hit back with a Hull try. But almost immediately Wire's prop Phil Sumner raced through to score. Rudd added the goal and then a penalty. Hull had the final say with a spectacular breakaway by Andrew Mighty and Eastwood's third goal. CLAYBANKER CHARLES FAWCUS CLAYBANK could prove a blinking good bet at Ayr today if Barry Hills's big race plan pays off. Barry fits a visor on his colt for the first time in the Ladbrokes Ayr Gold Cup in a bid to cover all the angles. \\u2018My son Michael rode him at Newcastle where they were second to Venture Capitalist and felt that a visor would help the horse to concentrate more,\\u2019 said the trainer. \\u2018You've got to do everything to give yourself a bit of an advantage in a race like this, so we'll put the visor on. We've got the beating of Venture Capitalist on that run and he's got the beating of Lochsong so in theory we should have a big chance. \\u2018The horse is certainly in good heart and because we are drawn close to Lochsong we are on the side of the track with a strong pace guaranteed. All we need now is the luck.\\u2019 Richard Hannon is confident of a bold show from Venture Capitalist. \\u2018He was nearly knocked down at Doncaster and finished just a neck behind Lochsong. We are 9lb better off at Ayr so we've got to fancy our chances.\\u2019 EU ON CLOUD 9 Chris aiming to stamp on another challenger in Glasgow tonight Champ lays a trap for tough guy Tony IAN GIBB CHRIS EUBANK is determined to be the British Bulldog who tears a chunk out of New Jersey punching postman Tony Thornton in Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition centre tonight. It's WBO super-middleweight champion Eubank's ninth world title fight in just 22 months \\u2014 and there's to be no let-up in his quest to earn the money that can give him retirement in the next year. Assuming he stamps Thornton with a return-to-sender label tonight, the Chris Eubank caravan moves on to Manchester on November 28. Sheffield and Cardiff are also on the list of future venues as the controversial, unbeaten Brighton fighter carries on his own tour of Britain. Promoter Barry Hearn told me: \\u2018He must have created some kind of record already with this his ninth world title fight in under two years. \\u2018And there's no stopping him. His appetite for fights and, of course, making money is such that he wants to make his pile as quickly as possible and get out.\\u2019 Damaged I understand names like Paraguay's Juan Carlos Giminez, who had to pull out of a previous challenge with a damaged hand, Americans Darrin Van Horn and Lindell Holmes plus Italian Vicenzo Nardiello have already been short-listed for November. They are all walk-forward, exciting types of fighters, and Hearn added: \\u2018We'll never ever go for non-fighters like Ron Essett again. They are poison. Chris loses interest against them.\\u2019 That's why WBA champion Michael Nunn and our own former world title challenger Herol Graham haven't a prayer of ever facing Eubank. Thornton should certainly be in the rugged bracket. \\u2018His style is that he keeps coming forward,\\u2019 observes Eubank. \\u2018His strength could turn out to be his weakness.\\u2019 And that's where Eubank hopes the American will play right into his fists in the Daily-Mirror sponsored fight. Chris has looked decidedly uncomfortable against runners and awkward opponents. But with Thornton, what you see is what you get. And he may be marching into a trap with a right hand that needed surgery on it three fights ago to enable him to continue in boxing. There is an ugly lump on his right fist and Thornton doesn't sound too confident when asked whether it would stand up to a hard fight. Although he enjoys a top four rating in all the major organisations, including the IBF, WBA and WBC, his winning record is studded with nonentities. He did halt Dave Tiberi in four rounds, the same man who was robbed when challenging IBF middleweight champion James Toney. But Tiberi is not really in Thorton's 12st class. Eubank has no special game plan tonight and says: \\u2018I'll play it by ear and in accordance to Thornton's fighting spirit. You may say he has an intimidating record. But that's nothing new to me \\u2014 I've fought plenty of people who were intimidating. That's part of the business.\\u2019 Eubank has been at his best when right up against it and facing defeat, especially in the battle with Nigel Benn that first gave him the world middleweight title and then when he climbed off the floor in the second, tragic contest with Michael Watson. Unbeaten He is also fiercely protective of that unbeaten record despite constantly saying that he's only in boxing for the money. \\u2018Every day I think about losing\\u2019 he says. \\u2018That's what keeps me winning.\\u2019 Thornton, shaven skulled to hide his baldness, knows this is his one chance, at 33, to crack the big money and supplement his modest postman's wages. He says: \\u2018I didn't come here to put a notch on Chris's belt. I'm looking for a lot of fireworks to fly.\\u2019 Eubank will spare a thought for Michael Watson. It's a year to within two days since he put the brave Londoner into a coma, from which he is only now slowly recovering. Eubank said: \\u2018Michael is never far from my thoughts \\u2014 but he'll understand better than anyone that on the day I must close out everything except the fight. I'll tell him after how it went.\\u2019 It should be a happy account and I take Eubank to halt the smaller-framed Thornton by the eighth round. If the fight goes the distance, there might hardly be the thickness of a stamp between them unless Chris ups his recent workrate. But he should have the power to hurt the battle weary, 36-fight Thornton \\u2014 and then move on to Manchester. HAVE BELT, WILL TRAVEL CHRIS Eubank's world championship roadshow stops in Glasgow tonight for his ninth title fight in just 22 months. Next stop could be Manchester. TARTAN TERROR TONY THORNTON'S wife Carole took an instant liking to his new tartan kilt yesterday. Higgins' dream on cue FALLEN hero Alex \\u2018Hurricane\\u2019 Higgins took another step on the comeback trail last night when he beat Canadian Kirk Stephens 10-5 to keep alive his dream of a return to the Crucible. The 43-year-old Irishman is having to battle through the qualifying rounds in Blackpool to try and clinch a place in next April's finals of the \\u00a31 million Embassy world championship in Sheffield. The two times world champion, now rated No. 72, trailed Stevens 5-4 overnight but, without having to produce his best form, he won the next six frames in succession to win their third qualifying round tie. Higgins, whose highest break of the session was 44, said: \\u2018The snooker was nothing to write home about but I'm pleased to get a step nearer Sheffield.\\u2019 He added: \\u2018I felt sorry for Kirk. He's not the player he used to be but I suppose you could say the same about me.\\u2019 In the next round Higgins meets Brian Morgan, of Essex, over 19 frames. Ronnie O'Sullivan, a 16year-old from Essex, finished with breaks of 72, 74, and 83 to beat Paul Davies, a Hampshire-based Welshman, 10-5. HIGGINS: Battling Not so crazy, gang JOHN EDWARDS DAVE Bassett last night laughed off Sheffield United's bad-boy image. \\u2018We're angels compared to my old Crazy Gang,\\u2019 he insisted. United and today's opponents Arsenal have both been under the disciplinary spotlight, having picked up a stack of yellow cards between them. But Bassett reflected on his early management days in charge of Vinny Jones and Co at Wimbledon. And he said: \\u2018That mob could have gone in against a team containing Mike Tyson and Joe Frazier and looked after themselves. \\u2018Maybe my connection with them has rebounded on Sheffield United. \\u2018We seem to be automatically tagged a physical side. \\u2018I've seen tackles going in from other sides that would without question produce a booking for a United player.\\u2019 Bassett gives \\u00a3150,000 summer signing Alan Kelly his debut in place of suspended goalkeeper Simon Tracey. BASSETT: Angels TRACEY: Banned MIXING IT WITH THE BEST King Kenny's brave brigade ALEC JOHNSON BLACKBURN boss Kenny Dalglish takes his expensive collection of stars to rough and tumble Wimbledon today, insisting: \\u2018I can't wrap them up in cotton wool.\\u2019 His \\u00a33.3 million striker Alan Shearer is still battle-scarred from his recent trips to Spain and Highbury. But Dalglish said: \\u2018Alan is a brave player and he can handle it. \\u2018That goes for the rest of the team. You expect there will be strong physical challenges because, after all, it is a contact game. \\u2018But you don't complain. You just get on with it. The players are strong and fit and can look after themselves. \\u2018It is up to the referees to decide whether or not the tackles are fair or not. As long as they are doing their jobs I see no problems.\\u2019 Blackburn suffered their first defeat of the season in midweek when lost 3-2 at home to Everton. Dalglish said: \\u2018I was disappointed that we lost but not with our performance for I thought we played well. \\u2018All credit to Everton for that was probably the best they have played this season. \\u2018That defeat will not have affected the spirit of the team and they will be going out against Wimbledon as determined as ever. \\u2018Wimbledon are always a difficult side to beat, especially on their own ground. \\u2018It is up to us to play to our strengths and try to control the game.\\u2019 Dalglish picks from a squad of 16. SHEARER: Strong DALGLISH: Defiant PETER PERFECT Sch\\u2026he's on title trail KEN LAWRENCE PETER SCHMEICHEL arrives in London for the first time this season convinced Manchester United can become the first Premier League champions. The Great Dane, recently voted the world's best goalkeeper, will be looking for his seventh shut-out in a row as Manchester United take on Tottenham today. And last night he insisted: \\u2018We know the feeling of losing the title by half a horse's head \\u2014 but it won't happen this time. We are playing better than last season. \\u2018We are more mature as a team and we are more clever. \\u2018The problem last season was that we were too successful. We were involved in so much. \\u2018And while we felt we were the best team in England, we were killed by our own success. \\u2018We play too many games in this country. Last season at United it was one game every three days \\u2014 and it was too much.\\u2019 Difficult With his amazing current shut-out record, Schmeichel has confirmed boss Alex Ferguson's opinion that he is the best in the game. Fergie enthused: \\u2018Peter has IMPROVED from last season. \\u2018We had a difficult start to this season and our defence was making mistakes. \\u2018But now we are showing real discipline and concentration \\u2014 and Peter's had a big say in that.\\u2019 Schmeichel added: \\u2018We are quite happy that unlike last year we are not out in front. This time it would suit us fine to stay behind the pace \\u2014 and jump to the front as late as possible.\\u2019 That is looking an increasingly difficult task as United soar towards the summit. And with Paul Ince, Darren Ferguson and Ryan Giggs all available again, Fergie is also boosted by the fact that Danny Wallace has finally rid himself of his hang-ups. He'll be on the bench today and the boss says: \\u2018Danny has finally learned he has nothing to prove here \\u2014 whereas I think he tried too hard before. \\u2018Now he is standing right at the door and knocking to get in. \\u2018I'd have sold him for \\u00a3600,000 in the summer but there were no takers. Thank goodness for that, because it would have been the sale of the century.\\u2019 SCHMEICHEL: \\u2018We're playing better than last season\\u2019 FERGUSON: Tribute A WING AND PRAYER Spurs sweat on dazzling Darren Duel of the whizz-kids NEIL SILVER BRITAIN'S two wondrous whizz-kid wingers may come face to face today when Darren Anderton's Tottenham Hotspur meet Ryan Giggs' Manchester United at White Hart Lane. The prospect conjures up magic memories of the vintage clashes featuring Jimmy Greaves and George Best, but \\u00a32 million Anderton is still battling to shake off a stomach strain. Tottenham fans are still waiting to see the England Under-21 international produce the scintillating form that he displayed at his former club Portsmouth. Desperate But Spurs coach Doug Livermore said: \\u2018It is just a matter of time before Darren explodes \\u2014 then watch him go.\\u2019 Anderton suffered his troublesome injury at Coventry on Monday night, but played on. Assistant coach Ray Clemence said: \\u2018Darren was feeling the injury at half-time but didn't want to let the rest of the boys down by coming off. That's the kind of lad he is and he's desperate to do well.\\u2019 Anderton faces a late fitness test, along with Gordon Durie, Teddy Sheringham and Andy Gray. Vinny Samways is definitely out after damaging ankle ligaments at Coventry. Spurs have drafted in Justin Edinburgh, Terry Fenwick, David Tuttle and John Hendrie to a 17-man squad. GIGGS: Great talent ANDERTON: Faces late fitness test Mark's tipped for top NIGEL CLARKE GEORGE Graham showed last night that he is ready to let loose another of his hungry young pack. He named Mark Flatts in his squad at Sheffield United only a week after giving 18-year-old Ian Selley his debut. Graham has pencilled in Flatts, 19, as a stand-by for the injured Anders Limpar and says: \\u2018I would have no fears about playing him. He is a talented player, happy on either wing.\\u2019 Two broken legs have held back Flatts. But Graham has never been afraid to experiment. Two successive defeats have brought about fresh criticism and Graham adds: \\u2018We know what people are saying. But to be honest, we thrive on it.\\u2019 Both Arsenal and United have picked up a stack of yellow cards. But Blades manager Dave Bassett reflected on his early days in charge of Vinny Jones and Co. at Wimbledon and said: \\u2018That mob could have gone in against a team containing Mike Tyson and Joe Frazier and looked after themselves. GRAHAM: Confident BASSETT: Tough guys TONY STAYS LOYAL RICHARD TANNER STRIKER Tony Cottee last night knocked rumours that he is keen to return to London. \\u2018I want to earn a new contract with Everton,\\u2019 he insisted. The \\u00a32 million former West Ham man has endured an up-and-down four years on Merseyside. After months of injury frustration, he took a definite up-swing on Tuesday by launching his season with the two-goal blast that wrecked Blackburn's unbeaten run. And he faces Crystal Palace today determined to show he can still play a key part in Howard Kendall's blueprint for the future. \\u2018It's up to me to convince Everton to give me a new contract,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I just want to play regular football and I don't think there's a better place to do that than at Goodison.\\u2019 Everton are without broken leg victim Mark Ward and Polish winger Robert Warzycha, who misses the next two games because of international duty. Striker Paul Rideout faces a late fitness test on a shoulder injury. COTTEE: Staying The iron maiden LIZ MCCOLGAN is out to prove herself the iron woman of athletics in tomorrow's IAAF/Diet Coke World half marathon championship on Tyneside. McColgan fronts Britain's challenge seven weeks after flopping in the Barcelona Olympics. POOR TREVOR LEFT OWLING But the pain isn't over yet JOHN EDWARDS TREVOR Francis is ready to drag his weary frame through another 90 minutes of torture at Norwich today. The 38-year-old Sheffield Wednesday player-manager made his first full appearance for 17 months in the 8-1 UEFA Cup rout of Spora Luxembourg in midweek. But it was murder for Francis, who said: \\u2018I thought a European tie would be easier than the Premier League \\u2014 but I miscalculated. \\u2018As it turned out, we launched attack after attack for the entire 90 minutes and there was simply no respite. I still enjoyed playing again but even now I'm feeling very tired.\\u2019 New signing Mark Bright returns to the attack after being ineligible for the Spora tie. But with makeshift striker Paul Warhurst facing a long lay-off after his horror injury, Francis must again decide between himself, Nigel Jemson and Gordon Watson for the other place. \\u2018I'll see how I feel before deciding but it's a bit of a predicament,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I've got to weigh it up carefully and make sure I can justify my selection.\\u2019 Wednesday's injury crisis will ease next week when England striker David Hirst starts his comeback from a cracked ankle. He will resume training on Monday and could be in line for a place in Wednesday's Coca Cola Cup tie against Hartlepool. Warhurst was allowed home from hospital yesterday after the clash with Spora's keeper that knocked him out and almost cost him his life. FRANCIS: Still weary WARHURST: Recovery Give us a lift, Craig CRAIG SHORT makes his \\u00a32.5 million debut for Derby County tomorrow \\u2014 joining a bunch of players feeling sorry for themselves. That's the verdict of manager Arthur Cox, who is desperate that his men show their true colours at West Ham and score their first win of the season. Big-spending Derby were pipped by Middlesbrough for automatic promotion last time \\u2014 then they lost to Blackburn in the play-offs. \\u2018Maybe we've still got to get that out of our systems,\\u2019 said Cox. \\u2018If that's the case, it's time to knuckle down because ability that doesn't come covered in sweat is not enough.\\u2019 Defender Short, signed from Notts County, chose Derby not Blackburn. He will play in this TV clash with Simon Coleman in danger of losing his place. Keeper Steve Sutton is suspended and Martin Taylor deputises. West Ham skipper Julian Dicks is also banned and they will keep the side that won 5-1 at Bristol City in midweek. Meanwhile Cox, who has spent \\u00a39.5 million in ten months, is deciding whether to lay out another \\u00a3100,000 on Dutch midfielder Richard Goulooze. WALSH BUZZING TOUGH Leicester defender Steve Walsh is planning to clean up his act after serving a three-match ban already this season. Walsh \\u2014 whose \\u2018bad boy\\u2019 reputation began five years ago when he received a record nine-match ban after an incident that left Shrewsbury's David Geddis with a broken jaw \\u2014 returns today for the visit of Brentford. \\u2018I'm more determined than ever to stay out of trouble,\\u2019 he said. Beardo danger MATT HUGHES INJURY-HIT Crystal Palace go in search of their first Premier League win today at Everton with boss Steve Coppell fearing the Peter Beardsley factor. Coppell said: \\u2018Blackburn number two Ray Harford told me Beardsley was magnificent in Everton's 3-2 win over them this week. \\u2018He is one of those players you want in your side because you know he will be superb week-in, week-out. If he gets back into the England team it will be deservedly so.\\u2019 Palace, yet to keep a clean sheet this season, are without Geoff Thomas with a trapped nerve in his neck as well as long-term injury victims Richard Shaw, Andy Thorn and Simon Rodger. England goalkeeper Nigel Martyn has also been laid low by a virus this week. Everton are without broken-leg victim Mark Ward and Polish winger Robert Warzycha, who misses the next two games because of international duty. Striker Paul Rideout faces a late fitness and Mo Johnston, Peter Beagrie and Stuart Barlow are on stand-by. DIXON SET KERRY DIXON returns for Southampton against Leeds at The Dell today in search of his 200th League goal. Former Chelsea striker Dixon is back after missing two matches with an ankle injury. \\u2018I have been in the 190s for more than a year, so I will be glad to get there,\\u2019 said Dixon. David Speedie and Terry Hurlock, the Saints players at the centre of a brawl in an exclusive Channel Islands hotel, have been fined by manager Ian Branfoot. GOOD AS GOLD SUNDERLAND boss Malcolm Crosby last night backed Don Goodman to end his goal famine. He said: \\u2018Goodman will come good. He has worked his socks off and he'll get his reward.\\u2019 The tricky and talented Goodman is a target for Derby. But Crosby said: \\u2018He's staying here.\\u2019 Sunderland travel to Cambridge, with Crosby saying: \\u2018I want the players to go out and not be afraid to take a few risks.\\u2019 But John Byrne, Anton Rogan and John Colquhoun are injured. Going batty It's just not cricket MARTIN RICHARDS KIWI Test ace Kevin Iro and West Indies Test ace Richie Richardson swapped a few jokes \\u2014 and bat and ball \\u2014 when they arrived at Headingley yesterday. Iro, who will play for Leeds and Richardson, Yorkshire's overseas import, officially signed on the dotted line. The 16-stone 6ft 2in New Zealander, who holds the Wembley try-scoring record with six tries in a total of four Challenge Cup final appearances with Wigan, is aiming to go back again in a Leeds jersey. \\u2018Wigan are a high pro-file side and so are Leeds and I certainly wouldn't mind a trip back to Wembley,\\u2019 he said. But he will have to wait to get into the action \\u2014 an ankle injury has sidelined him for two weeks. Butch Cassidy and the Indy Kid Film legend Paul Newman talks exclusively to the DAILY MIRROR \\u2018I hustled to get Mansell\\u2019 He's a great champ TED MACAULEY A SWEET-TALKING phone call from film superstar Paul Newman wiped out any worries Nigel Mansell had about switching to killer-car Indy racing in America after quitting Formula One. The Hollywood actor, a racing fanatic, booked a call to Brummie Mansell at his Isle of Man home when he heard about the world champion's bitter split with the Renault-Williams team. And that was that \\u2014 Mansell was hooked. They agreed a contract that will bring Mansell \\u00a33million a year, a pittance compared with the \\u00a312 million he was offered to rejoin Ferrari and the \\u00a38 million a year he was on at Renault-Williams. But with prize-money soaring to \\u00a3500,000 a race, he is poised to become American motor sport's biggest earner. New adventure And last night Newman, star of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and joint-owner with Chicago businessman Carl Haas of America's top Indy team, told me: \\u2018I am really excited about Nigel joining us. \\u2018I know what a great driver he is. I have followed his career closely. He is a superb champion. And he will do well in our team.\\u2019 Newman, who still races even though he's turned 60, believes Mansell can carry on now for at least another six or seven years. And he revealed: \\u2018We met by accident just recently and I got to talking to him about Indy. \\u2018Then we had a chat on the phone last week and I told Nigel it would be a new adventure for him if he joined our team and that we are all looking forward to his racing in America. \\u2018I am very  enthusiastic . He will be a great boost to the Newman-Haas team and to Indy car racing in the States.\\u2019 An announcement timed to be released simultaneously in Britain and America confirmed my world exclusive in Mirror Sport yesterday that Mansell had done the deal. Mansell will commute to races from his ritzy \\u00a34million oceanside mansion in Clearwater, Florida and will now sell his \\u00a33million cliff-top home in the Isle of Man. Wonderful He telephoned his wife Rosanne in America, where she is with their three kids, and told her of his decision and then from his Port Erin home said: \\u2018Indy car racing is a wonderful new challenge for me. \\u2018I have seen quite a few races on television and the competition is really good.\\u2019 Lion-hearted Nigel doesn't worry about the high-speed horrors of blasting around a concrete oval, six inches from a wall at up to 240 mph with 30 other drivers all battling for the same space \\u2014 and no runoffs if you crash. He says: \\u2018Indianapolis and the other ovals will be a new experience. I am ready to give it a go. It doesn't scare me.\\u2019 Mansell is 39 \\u2014 but top drivers carry on into their 50's in the 16-race Indy series that, oddly, kicks off in Surfer's Paradise, Australia. \\u2018Paul missed that race last year,\\u2019 said Carl Haas, \\u2018but sure as hell he'll be there for Nigel's debut early next year.\\u2019 Fabulous Mansell's first taste of Indy action will be in California in December when he tests the monster motor that will hurtle him to the threshold of survival in the most hair-raising episode of his race career. He is the first reigning Formula One world champion to make the switch and Haas, a wealthy ex-racer, admitted: \\u2018We know he had a fabulous offer from Ferrari. But he honestly only wanted to defend his title with Williams. \\u2018Okay, we are paying him plenty \\u2014 not nearly as much as he gets in F1 \\u2014 but real good. \\u2018But he's worth every penny.\\u2019 Haas, talking to me from the team HQ in Illinois, was anxious to underline that neither he or Newman had unfairly, unethically, rocked the Williams boat. Said Haas: \\u2018Whatever anybody says we had no deal with Nigel before he fell out with Frank Williams. \\u2018But as soon as he he had real problems and got unhappy with Williams, he became seriously interested in Indy racing. \\u2018He told us he couldn't see anywhere else to go and he'd like to join the team. \\u2018I'd talked to him a year ago \\u2014 and we just kept in touch. Then Paul rang him and that was it. We'd got our guy.\\u2019 BYE-BYE BRITAIN WORLD champion Nigel Mansell waves goodbye to the Formula One racing circuit after this season \\u2014 and the battling Brummie will also sell his \\u00a33million Isle of Man cliff-top mansion to live in the Florida sunshine as he joins superstar Paul Newman's team PARDNERS! NIGEL MANSELL is no Robert Redford lookalike \\u2014 but then the film star hasn't won many Grand Prix races! FLASHBACK Mirror Sport yesterday exclusively revealed Nigel Mansell's Indy racing plans BIG WHEEL PAUL Newman is a star of the track as well as the screen, and has a date with Mansell for the first Indy race in Australia WRONG! TED MACAULEY THREE-TIMES world champion Nelson Piquet, who survived an Indy horror crash three months ago, last night blasted Nigel Mansell for quitting Formula One. \\u2018He's an idiot,\\u2019 said Piquet, once a team-mate of Mansell's \\u2014 but never a friend. \\u2018But having said that,\\u2019 he added \\u2018I think he will do well. He's such a bloody good driver.\\u2019 Piquet's 200 mph crash nearly took off his legs and left him with a limp for life. But, even at 40, he still burns with ambition to dump Indy racing and make a Grand Prix come-back. He added: \\u2018Indy circuits, particularly the ovals, are really dangerous. And Nigel will have to watch out. \\u2018But he should have stayed with Williams. It's a shame we won't see him racing on equal terms against Senna or Prost.\\u2019 PIQUET: Horror THE GANG'S STILL CRAZY AND THAT'S ONLY THE RESERVES TWO SENT OFF SEVEN BOOKED DOORS SMASHED WALLS GOUGED FRANK WIECHULA WIMBLEDON reserves, the club's second-string Crazy Gang, were booted out by Southampton after allegedly causing hundreds of pounds of damage to changing rooms. The Dirty Dons are accused of smashing two doors and of gouging walls before getting their marching orders from reserve ground Marchwood after a stormy clash on Wednesday. Wimbledon won 4-2, had Steve Anthrobus and Gerald Dobbs sent off and seven players booked. Southampton, who had the worst  disciplinary record in the League last season, had three players booked.  Saints secretary Brian Truscott said: \\u2018After the game they were screaming, chanting and shouting. It stopped only when we told them to leave. \\u2018We will be billing Wimbledon for damage caused, although we don't know at this stage how much it will all cost. \\u2018It is not just the cost. It is the principle of having respect for other people's property. \\u2018It is a great shame that we should provide such a superb facility and then see it treated like that.\\u2019 Wimbledon assistant manager Terry Burton countered: \\u2018Whenever we win, we have a sing-song. We do enjoy our football and we enjoy winning. \\u2018We were happy, we were delighted and we were singing. They came in and asked us to stop. \\u2018It's probably sour grapes after they've been beaten 4-2 by nine men. They can't be enjoying their football down there at the moment if that's the only thing they've got to moan about. \\u2018Our reserve team manager Brian Sparrow is amazed at the accusations about damage to property. \\u2018He asked the senior players if they'd seen anything as they came away from the dressing-room and they said they hadn't. \\u2018Apparently someone said there was plaster off the wall. But before players go out they tend to kick the wall to make sure their boots are on properly. \\u2018Most clubs have scuffs around the base of their walls where players have kicked them. Or they've kicked the base of a door to make sure their boot is on comfortably. \\u2018It could possible have been something like that. And anything that has been done \\u2014 if it's been done \\u2014 has certainly been done accidentally and not intentionally. \\u2018Brian thought that the sendings-off were a bit unfortunate. He felt that there were not really any nasty tackles. \\u2018He felt the referee did not have a particularly good game and I think he's going to speak to the League about that.\\u2019 Reg Davis, Wimbledon's commercial manager, added: \\u2018If damage was caused, then it is only right that we should be sent a bill for the repairs. \\u2018As for the matters on the pitch, I think it's a bit of a coincidence we were playing Southampton when this happened. Their disciplinary record speaks for itself.\\u2019 HANDY MILKMAN Andy Till, 29, took the British light-middleweight title at Watford last night by a wafer-thin margin. The London fighter outpointed Wally Swift over 12 rounds with a 118-117 verdict from referee Mickey Vann. Birmingham's Swift boxed for half the fight one-handed after damaging his right fist. Send for Simon COLIN PRICE ENGLAND'S forgotten hero Simon Hodgkinson is in line for a squad recall after David Pears broke his jaw at Bath. Pears prefers to play fly-half but both England and Harlequins see him as an attacking full-back. He was named ahead of Hodgy as record-breaking Jon Webb's cover for the opening international against Canada at Wembley on October 17. But his nightmare start to the season ended in a broken jaw as double winners Bath started their Courage League defence with a 22-6 win. Three weeks ago Pears was rushed to hospital for x-rays to a head injury after being injured during a sevens tournament. Now he faces at least two months on the sidelines. One of the first on the scene to treat him at Bath was full back Jon Webb, an orthopaedic surgeon. Webb, who has agreed to play on for both Bath and England until a Registrar's appointment becomes available, kicked five penalties and converted a superb Jeremy Guscott try to sink Quins. Former Quins centre Ron Eriksson had plenty to celebrate with the only try in London Scottish's 8-3 win over a rebuilt Gloucester side. Tony Underwood raced in for a 70 metre try in Leicester's 30-14 win at London Irish. Bristol's new fly-half Andy May missed five penalties as his side went down 16-6 to Northampton. Alan Buzza kicked 14 points as Wasps came back from West Hartlepool with a 19-6 victory. Ben Crawley got the only try as Saracens beat relegation favourites Rugby 14-6. HODGKINSON: chance OVER THE MOON Welsh facing back trouble COLIN PRICE WALES chiefs Alan Davies and Robert Norster face a rare new headache tonight as they sit down to pick the first squad of an exciting new season. They've got almost too much back talent from which to choose a side to play Italy at Cardiff on October 7. Another Heineken weekend of records and dazzling rugby has convinced fans that Wales are on the brink of a new golden era of back play. And no-one would be surprised if that first national side of the season includes another Englishman, Rupert Moon, to partner his record-breaking Llanelli team-mate Colin Stephens. Fastest A third Scarlet, Neil Boobyer, is tipped for the centre while Nigel Walker, rated the fastest man in world rugby, could be a shock choice on the left wing after just a handful of Cardiff games. Stephens, capped three times last season, is now oozing confidence in Llanelli's all-action side and scored an incredible 39 points in shattering Newport's unbeaten record. That haul included three of the 11 tries that hoisted Llanelli's total to 26 in just three games as they won 79-10. Wales skipper Ieuan Evans also got three before limping off with a groin injury. And national coach Davies was so impressed that he wants a full video shown to all clubs as the perfect illustration of playing under the new laws. That runaway win ensures a full house at Stradey Park on Saturday to see defending champions Swansea in a repeat of last season's Schweppes Cup final. Swansea were only half a dozen points short of matching Llanelli's record haul in a spectacular 73-24 thrashing of South Wales Police. Star of the Swansea show against the overrun police was CID officer Simon Davies with a hat-trick of tries. The Police were so worried about Davies in the sixth round of the Schweppes Cup last season that they knocked him out by giving him a Saturday shift. Davies got his revenge in spectacular fashion as Swansea tore the police apart in an 11-try bonanza. Police team manager David Rees said: \\u2018We should have switched him to a Saturday afternoon shift. I think he will be back on traffic duty after doing that to us.\\u2019 Mark Titley, switched from wing to fly-half, landed nine conversions in a rare kicking display as well as getting a try. Nigel Walker, clocked at 10.35 secs for the 100 metres, ignored fellow Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson's advice to set up Cardiff's 39-14 win over Newbridge. Jackson said: \\u2018I told Nigel he was too thin to play rugby and that they would break him in half.\\u2019 Stretcher Fly-half Adrian Davies topped 50 League points in three matches with a try, two penalties and four conversions. Meanwhile former Wales hooker Kevin Phillips looks certain to quit the game after being stretchered off in Neath's 24-20 win at Bridgend. He admitted: \\u2018This might be the end. My life is more important than rugby.\\u2019 Neath, rocked by centre Colin Laity's decision to leave in midweek, were relieved when giant No 8 Paul Jones got the all-clear after being kicked in the head. Jones played on, helping back row partner Adrian Varney grab two tries, before going to hospital for x-rays on his jaw. MARK Egan of Newbridge gets to grips with Cardiff's Mike Rayer on Saturday. MOON: Ready That's final by George FORMER Hull boss Brian Smith showed why he's one of the game's top coaches by steering St George into their first Sydney Grand Final since 1985. Smith and assistant Rod Reddy, the ex-Barrow coach, watched their side beat Illawarra 4-0. The Dragons now go through to meet red-hot favourites the Brisbane Broncos in next Sunday's final. LUCA CUMANI and Frankie Dettori did an Italian job yesterday with Masad who beat Modhish and In A Tiff in the Grand Premio D'Italia at San Siro. OFF TO THE DOGS HARRY LLOYD TRACK promoters and bookmakers are locked in a bitter \\u00a33.5million dogfight over punters' cash. Bookmakers say they should handle the betting tax rebate as the money comes from their betting shops. Greyhound racing claims the Chancellor earmarked the windfall for the tracks in his March Budget. It's the poor old punter who pays the betting tax in stoppages from winning bets \\u2014 but he won't get a penny. It's not the first time punters, who bet \\u00a31.6billion a year just on the dogs, have found themselves cornered in the doghouse. Betting shops deduct ten per cent from punters' winnings \\u2014 a whopping two per cent over the odds which puts a \\u00a310million perk in bookies' pockets. If the money was ploughed back into dog racing \\u2014 horse racing enjoys a \\u00a340million levy \\u2014 tracks could improve amenities and strengthen security which would encourage more people to go to the dogs. Prolific winner Murlens Abbey just gets the nod in a red-hot Fosters Select Stakes at Wembley. The Abbey, from Trap 1, should gain first run on Sheffield record-breaker Pineapple Lemon. Daily Mirror/Sporting Life Grand National winner Kildare Slippy and the powerful My Texette are among the stars in a brilliant supporting card. Kingswell Limo, Duagh Colours and Skelligs March are three to follow in the Wey Plastics Puppy Derby semis at Wimbledon on Tuesday. The Limo, a sub-28sec performer, has the style to go all the way in Saturday's final. Toulon and Lets All Boogie at Walthamstow and Harbour Breeze at Hackney are other Tuesday fancies. CRAYFORD's Some Rabbit was tagged The Fugitive when he went on the run from his Essex kennels. His 12-day taste of freedom slimmed down the heavyweight performer who has notched six wins from 16 starts. Some Rabbit, from a handy six-metre start, should quickly escape his rivals in tonight's 540 handicap to bolt up. Wimbledon's auction on Wednesday carries the incentive of a \\u00a320,000 bonus if the sale dog wins the Daily Mirror/Sporting Life Derby. ARAZI FLOPS CHARLES FAWCUS ARAZI'S reputation nose-dived again yesterday when the one-time wonder horse could finish only third at Longchamp. But trainer Francois Boutin came out of his corner in fighting mood. Last year's champion had been expected to stroll home against second-division opposition in the Prix du Prince D'Orange before another Breeders Cup bid. But he finished six lengths behind the winner Arcangues, who could manage only eighth place in the Coral Eclipse at Sandown, losing second place on the post. Defeat was no disaster however to Boutin who still expects his fallen hero to rise again. \\u2018I still believe that I can find the great horse of last year,\\u2019 he declared. \\u2018Arazi came to today's race after enduring all sorts of problems \\u2014 the trip to America for the Kentucky Derby, a hard race at Ascot when he wasn't right and an injury which stopped him running two weeks ago. Power \\u2018I think he ran as well as he could in the circumstances and he'll go again at Longchamp in two weeks.\\u2019 Steve Cauthen blamed lack of staying power and Arazi will revert to a mile on Arc day. But it wasn't all gloom for Cauthen over the week-end and a brilliant ride landed the Irish St Leger on Mashaallah. Steve refused to be drawn when Willie Carson set a suicidal pace on Jahafil, but was still far enough ahead of the others to have a winning lead off the final bend. \\u2018I worked for Vincent O'Brien for a year and it's great to come back here and win my first classic,\\u2019 said trainer John Gosden. \\u2018If Mashaallah gets the mud he wants he could well run in the Arc.\\u2019 Carson was unlucky all round, as his regular ride Lochsong killed off the Ayr Gold Cup opposition under apprentice Francis Arrowsmith. Winning trainer Ian Balding was in New York seeing Spinning finish a brave third in the Man O' War Stakes. BAD BOYS IT'S A FACT SEVEN sendings-off made it the season's worst day for discipline and took the total to 50, compared with 64 at the same stage last season. I'M DOING IT FOR YOU MICHAEL FANZINE special on the force that's driving Eubank Respect for fallen hero IAN GIBB CHRIS EUBANK couldn't help himself \\u2014 the words of tribute to Michael Watson came tumbling out in a torrent, a year to the Saturday since he put the brave Londoner into a coma. Forgotten, momentarily, were the lumps and bumps and soreness of his face after the punishment he took from game but limited American challenger Tony Thornton in Glasgow on Saturday night. Today is the actual anniversary of the tragic night in Tottenham when Eubank crushed Watson \\u2014 and it is only recently that the Islington fighter has started to make a real recovery. Just the mention of his name started Eubank off. \\u2018What a blinding man, and I'm so very pleased that Michael is seeming to make an amazing recovery. \\u2018I've spoken to him a few times and he's the  epitome of a true warrior. He still wants to fight, believes he still has it in him to fight. \\u2018He's still sharp, has a sense of humour, he's witty. He's bitter about what happened \\u2014 he didn't want to lose. He hated that. \\u2018But I got punched to pieces that night and the only reason I won the fight was that I could still keep going in the 12th round. Brilliant \\u2018Since that day it hasn't looked too good for Michael, certainly not five or six months ago. Now he's brilliant. He said to me: \\u2018Bring the championship belt and a camera.\\u2019 \\u2018I'd willingly give him the belt but he wouldn't take it. The difference between us is that I don't like this boxing business \\u2014 and he still loves it, even now. \\u2018He keeps telling me that I must fight every contender and mustn't dodge anyone. He says as a champion I must perform well and give the public value for money. Then he says: \\u2018Are you ready for the re-match. Are you up to it?\\u2019 \\u2018He's still a warrior in his mind and you can't break his spirit. He will keep on trying to finish on his feet.\\u2019 Yet questions have to be asked quite seriously about whether Eubank himself can maintain his work-rate with a tenth world title fight lined up in just 24 months. He faces yet another challenge for his WBO super-  middleweight crown in Manchester on November 28. But I think it's all to do with Watson, the man he now respects so much. Eubank would fight every week if he could to make his fortune secure as soon as possible. Yet on Saturday night he may have run away from a million dollar showdown with Iran Barkley, a man Nigel Benn once conquered, now the IBF champion at 12 stone. Barkley's handler, Stan Hoffman, was in Glasgow to run the rule over Eubank \\u2014 and he wasn't impressed. He said: \\u2018I could not sell a Eubank-Barkley fight in the States after that performance. \\u2018All that running away in the last couple of rounds, it was crazy \\u2014 an American TV audience wouldn't like it.\\u2019 Eubank's promoter Barry Hearn may have different ideas, and is thinking of trying to put Barkley on against Eubank in Britain. That's even though the British Boxing Board have already ruled out Barkley from fighting here because of eye retina damage. If that fell down Hearn might think of staging such a fight in France. But that wouldn't happen until some time next year when Eubank could also be facing Nigel Benn \\u2014 especially if Benn lifts the WBC title in Italy next month. Eubank looked as though he was going to finish off Thornton in the ninth round \\u2014 and should have done so in the tenth. But he admitted: \\u2018I couldn't stay with his pace and I had to get away and look after myself.\\u2019 Thornton was not impressed by that tactic. He said: \\u2018What was the speed limit in the ring during those last couple of rounds? He ran his ass off! It must be wondered whether Eubank is jaded through having so many fights at a high level in such a short time. But it won't get any easier as Hearn promises: \\u2018We're only going to fight sluggers and tough guys. That may sound mercenary because Chris knows the rest of his career is limited, but it will be fun for people watching! Eubank insists: \\u2018I HAVE to fight. I NEED to fight. I WANT to fight \\u2014 on November 28. Yet even Eubank, deep down, does question his continuation in a sport that he has never really liked. He said: \\u2018It's nice to have a record of 33 wins in 33 fights, but in a way it is becoming tedious and I'm tired of winning all the time. \\u2018You can have too much of a good thing \\u2014 but the alternative is quite unacceptable\\u2026defeat.\\u2019 If he keeps pushing himself so hard, that unacceptable facet of boxing might have to be faced sooner or later. Thornton wasn't quite good enough to take his title, but Eubank might soon be so tired that someone, somewhere, will catch up with him. WHAT A BELTER! STILL champ \\u2014 but deep down Chris Eubank knows how close it was against punching postman Tony Thornton CHRIS makes his point to the fans EU better watch out \\u2014 Thornton throws a left FLASHBACK one year \\u2014 and joy that was soon to turn to despair for Eubank, with Michael Watson moments away from collapse Pictures: CHRIS GRIEVE PLATT'S GREAT BERNIE LOVETT DAVID PLATT celebrated his Italian league debut for Juventus yesterday with the goal that earned them a 2-2 draw at Genoa. The England midfielder has played just two domestic cup ties plus a UEFA Cup tie in midweek since his \\u00a36.5 million move from Bari this summer. Platt has had to wait in the wings because he is one of four foreign players fighting for the permitted three places. But he powered to the rescue nine minutes from time after a neat combination with Roberto Baggio. AC Milan stayed clear at the top of the table after beating Atalanta 2-0 in a match marred by crowd trouble. Police with truncheons waded in at the San Siro stadium as fighting broke out, although there were no immediate reports of severe injuries. Marco Van Basten grabbed his fourth goal of the season, 12 minutes after Daniele Massaro had broken the deadlock. Napoli failed to find their midweek scoring touch and went down 2-1 at home to an impressive Inter Milan in Channel 4's latest afternoon offering. Uruguayan striker Daniel Fonseca, scorer of all Napoli's five goals in their UEFA Cup midweek win against Valencia, hit the target again. But by then German ace Mathias Sammer and new signing Salvatore Schillaci had already put Inter 2-0 up. However, Schillaci, Italy's sensation of the 1990 World Cup missed a penalty two minutes from time, after being foul by goalkeeper Giovanni Galli. On another high-scoring day, Dane Brian Laudrup scored two goals as Fiorentina destroyed rock-bottom Ancona 7-1. Des Walker put his Spanish problems behind him as Sampdoria moved into third spot thanks to a 2-1 win at Udinese, while Lazio, minus Paul Gascoigne, registered their third consecutive draw. PLATT: Debut strike FLIER MARK Roe scored the biggest victory of his career when he shot a five- under-par final round of 65 to win the Lancome Trophy yesterday. The 29-year-old Yorkshireman finished two shots ahead of Argentinian Vicente Fernandez at Saint Nom La Breteche, near Paris \\u2014 despite hitting two spectators during the last nine holes. Ryder Cup star Steven Richardson finished in joint third while world number one Nick Faldo, seeking a fourth successive European tour victory, had to be content with joint 17th place. Roe, already third, fourth and fifth in European tour events this year, said: \\u2018I birdied the first three holes to give myself a flying start and never really looked back.\\u2019 ROE: Career best Mugs PAT Clinton hit back at the critics who jeered him after he retained his WBO flyweight title in Glasgow on Saturday. The 28-year-old champion was booed after taking a points decision over Hitchin's Danny Porter at the Scottish Exhibition Centre but he said: \\u2018They are the mugs, not me.\\u2019 \\u2018All three judges gave me the decision and having watched the video, I reckon I lost only two rounds \\u2014 the fourth and the tenth.\\u2019 Clinton needed five stitches in an eye cut he suffered in the first round, when he also badly displaced the knuckles on his left hand. The Scot said: \\u2018I was one punch away from knocking him out in the fifth and if I hadn't been injured, I would have finished him.\\u2019 CLINTON: Injured BURNT OUT Graham's tired lines Sheffield Utd 1, Arsenal 1 JOHN EDWARDS GEORGE GRAHAM claimed last night: \\u2018Some of my players are burnt out with the season only a month old!\\u2019 The Arsenal boss should have been feeling pleased after his side salvaged a late point. But he looked a picture of misery instead as he reflected on a the heavy demands on his men. Arsenal saved face with an Ian Wright leveller five minutes from time after having a jaded, end-of-season look \\u2014 eight months ahead of schedule! And that didn't surprise Graham one bit as he bluntly admitted: \\u2018I've got tired players on my hands, and we've only been playing five weeks. \\u2018Football is going down a path where the product is being sacrificed for the sake of finance, and I'm not happy about that. Whingeing \\u2018I know I'll be accused of just being another whingeing manager. But it's a fact that the vast majority of chairmen don't even talk to their managers about the workload that's being placed on players. \\u2018If they did, they would realise it's getting out of hand. \\u2018They would realise that foreign players think we're crazy to be playing more matches rather than fewer when our game is faster and more competitive than the rest. \\u2018It's sad for Graham Taylor as well as club managers like myself. \\u2018He had to pick an England team from what was left after the week-end games a fortnight ago, while I found myself with just two players at Highbury for almost the entire week. \\u2018There's no way we can bury our heads in the sand and pretend the problem doesn't exist. You only need to look at John Jensen to know it does. \\u2018He won the European championship with Denmark in June, and hasn't stopped playing since. He's already had a handful of World Cup qualifying ties in two or three different countries and is off to another one next week. \\u2018Is it any wonder the game as a spectacle is suffering?\\u2019 Graham hauled off Anders Limpar and Paul Merson 20 minutes from time and reverted to Arsenal's old five-man back line in a desperate late bid to peg back Dane Whitehouse's 49th-minute strike. And he didn't know whether to grin or grimace when it produced a point-saver from Wright after a link-up between Steve Bould and Lee Dixon. \\u2018I abandoned my better judgement by sacrificing the flair of Merson and Limpar, and that saddened me,\\u2019 added Graham. \\u2018I'd love to win games 6-0 playing entertaining skilful football, but equally I'd like to stay in a job.\\u2019 DANE AND OUT: Despairing Arsenal defender Lee Dixon is left on the deck as Dane Whitehouse (centre) fires Sheffield United ahead GRAHAM: Complaints Morris answer QPR 3, Middlesbrough 3 TONY STENSON CHRIS MORRIS admitted he nearly caused a touchline riot at the end of a high-octane thriller. The Irish defender was furious when he was judged to have given away a late penalty for tripping Andy Sinton. And when the whistle went seconds after Sinton tucked in his spot-kick, Morris went looking for trouble. He admitted: \\u2018It was my fault. Maybe I said things I should not have done \\u2014 it was over-reaction to the fact we lost two points we probably deserved, and to the manner they were lost.\\u2019 Sinton, also joining the candid club, said: \\u2018I didn't think it was a penalty, either.\\u2019 But that didn't save Morris from a rucking by Boro manager Lennie Lawrence. \\u2018Chris was well out of order,\\u2019 he said. Boro took the lead three times through Alan Kernaghan, Tommy Wright and Willie Falconer but each time were hauled back through Les Ferdinand, Gary Penrice and Sinton's first-ever penalty for Rangers. MORRIS: Sorry Brain waves Norwich 1, Sheff W 0 NEIL SILVER THE secret of Norwich's rise to the top can be revealed at last\\u2014 it's brain power! The clever Canaries may not be brimming with university honours but assistant manager John Deehan revealed: \\u2018We have got a set of very intelligent players \\u2014 and it would be naive of myself and the manager not to take their advice.\\u2019 Norwich's victory opened up a four- point lead at the top of the table with their fifth win on the trot. The decisive goal in the dying seconds of the first half was a beauty. Mark Robins bamboozled two defenders to whip in a cross which make-shift striker Rob Newman headed past England keeper Chris Woods. DEEHAN: Listens PROBED BARNET and Liverpool are among several clubs under investigation over the appearance of black-market tickets for last season's FA Cup final. Liverpool are carrying out their own internal inquiry at the request of the FA. \\u2018GIGGS BETTER THAN GAZZA\\u2019 Georgie boy reckons Ryan could be Best! Spurs 1, Manchester Utd 1 HARRY HARRIS RYAN GIGGS has the magical talent to become an even bigger star in British football than Paul Gascoigne was. And that prediction comes from a man who should know \\u2014 George Best, who witnessed the brilliant individual goal by Giggs which put United in the driving seat at White Hart Lane. Giggs is constantly compared to Best himself, but the former United hero said: \\u2018One day they might even say I was another Ryan Giggs! \\u2018Every time a winger comes along with skill he's labelled the latest George Best, but that's not fair on them \\u2014 or on me. \\u2018Ryan has the potential to be a great player. He seems a level-headed lad with a great temperament for the game. \\u2018He has everything\\u2026youth, skill and speed. He's a real talent \\u2014 and he could be a bigger star than Gazza.\\u2019 Giggs' goal was highlighted on Match of the Day, demonstrating uncanny reactions in taking advantage of Dean Austin's stumble, slipping the ball through Jason Cundy's legs and rounding keeper Ian Walker to shoot into a vacant net from an awkward angle. But Spurs found the character to come back and equalise through Gordon Durie on 56 minutes, and United manager Alex Ferguson applauded the new competitive edge to a side that ended his team's run of five straight wins. Ferguson said: \\u2018After losing Lineker, Gascoigne and Paul Stewart, it has been an enormous upheaval for them \\u2014 but they are starting to build again. \\u2018Nobody will find it easy here judging by what I've seen today.\\u2019 Spurs coach Doug Livermore was also full of praise for his side, particularly one of their own young hopes, Andy Turner. Future Livermore said: \\u2018For 70 minutes he showed tremendous  enthusiasm . He tired late on, but he has a great future. \\u2018Remember, he's just 17, he was playing before a full house, it was Manchester United \\u2014 but he took it all in his stride.\\u2019 But while United strive for the championship, Spurs, for the moment, are aiming for nothing more glamorous than some mid-table security. Owner Alan Sugar made the point: \\u2018Now under the leadership of Terry Venables, we feel that the team has tremendous potential\\u2026there is a need for a settling in period.\\u2019 WHITE HART PAIN: The Spurs defence is spreadeagled, and keeper Ian Walker grounded, as Ryan Giggs bursts through for his wonder goal GAV STAYING PUT N'castle 5, Bristol C 0 GAVIN PEACOCK is studying Italian at night school but won't be following Gazza in the player drain. Kevin Keegan is ready to wheel and deal to keep Newcastle top of the First Division but Peacock is not for sale. \\u2018He's going to be a key figure at this club for the next three or four years,\\u2019 said the Newcastle boss. The 24-year-old star could have left in the summer but insisted: \\u2018I know I made the right decision to stay.\\u2019 Peacock grabbed two penalties and Liam O'Brien, Franz Carr and Kevin Brock also scored to maintain the Magpies' 100 per cent League record. PEACOCK: Key man Cool it or else Soton 1, Leeds1 COLIN PRICE TERRY Hurlock and David Speedie have been warned to end the war \\u2014 or else. They came to blows in Jersey last weekend and Speedie was fined \\u00a350 in court. Both were fined by Southampton and boss Ian Branfoot had to think seriously about playing them together. He put them in central midfield \\u2014 and he would have been rewarded with a vital home win but for Gary Speed's late equaliser. But Branfoot warned: \\u2018I'll be keeping them under tight control from now on. \\u2018There was a team meeting on Thursday when we cleared the air. They had already shaken hands and been out for a meal together. \\u2018They have a future as long as they can channel their aggression in the right area. If they can't, they become liabilities.\\u2019 Perry Groves hit his first goal for the club, gloriously fashioned by Matt Le Tissier. HURLOCK: Warning SHOWDOWN It's want-away day for reject Jemson Norwich 1, Sheff Wed 0 NEIL SILVER NIGEL JEMSON will walk into Trevor Francis's office this morning and demand to have his future sorted out. Angry Jemson suffered the embarrassment of coming on as substitute and then being substituted himself at Carrow Road. Now he is gunning for Wednesday boss Francis for showdown talks about his on-off move back to Nottingham Forest. \\u2018I was surprised to be taken off,\\u2019 said fans' favourite Jemson. \\u2018I'll be going in to see the manager first thing Monday to sort out my future. \\u2018One minute I was going to Forest, the next it was all off. I don't know what the stumbling block is.\\u2019 Jemson lasted less than half-an-hour on Saturday. He came on after 51 minutes to replace the injured Francis, then was hauled off 11 minutes from the end in favour of Nigel Pearson. \\u2018The substitution was purely tactical because I wanted to get some height up front,\\u2019 said Francis. \\u2018I don't know what Nigel thought, you'll have to ask him that.\\u2019 Jemson added: \\u2018I'm very disappointed. Nothing much has gone right for me since January when I was injured in a car crash. I was a first team regular until then, but it has really set me back.\\u2019 Just a fortnight ago, 23-year-old Jemson was on the verge of re-joining Forest in a \\u00a31million-plus swap deal which would have taken Kingsley Black to Hillsborough. But the deal collapsed mysteriously and is yet to be resurrected. Jemson's problems shouldn't detract from woeful Wednesday's own troubles and their disappointing performance. The scoreline flattered the Owls, who never had a shot on target and were fortunate to concede only one goal, a stunning 44th minute header by makeshift striker Rob Newman from Mark Robins' clever cross. JEMSON: In to see boss today LIVERPOOL and Barnet are among several clubs under investigation over the appearance of black market tickets for last season's FA Cup final. Liverpool, who beat Sunderland at Wembley last May, are carrying out their own internal inquiry at the request of the FA. Central boss in swoop for Villa HARRY HARRIS CENTRAL TV want to buy a football club \\u2014 and Aston Villa are top of their shopping list. Gary Newbon, head of sport for Central, will tonight reveal his masterplan \\u2014 to purchase a Premier League club and provide his company with an influential foothold for future TV negotiations. On the BBC's Standing Room Only programme at 6.50 tonight, Newbon discusses the chances of an English club going the way of French team Paris St Germain, who were bought by Chanel Plus last year. Rules Newbon disclosed that he told his former managing director a couple of years ago: \\u2018I could get Oxford United very cheaply,\\u2019\\u2014 but his boss wasn't interested. But Newbon goes on to explain: \\u2018He's now gone and I'm talking to the present managing director. \\u2018If we are interested in a Midlands club, it would have to be a big one with a big following like Aston Villa. \\u2018That would give us a stronger inside track when it comes to deciding TV rights with the clubs. Standing Room Only researchers can find no rules or regulations to block Newbon's revolutionary plan. And the example set by Chanel Plus in France can only improve his chances of success in England. In the 12 months since Chanel Plus bought Paris St Germain, the club has been transformed from a financial cripple to a top-of-the-table French First Division outfit where crowds have doubled. Central TV have not yet made any approach to Villa owner Doug Ellis \\u2014 but if Ellis won't play ball, then Newbon may try his luck with other Midlands giants like Coventry or Nottingham Forest. Misfit Webb seeks move HARRY HARRIS OLD Trafford misfit Neil Webb is on the verge of demanding a transfer from Manchester United. The England midfielder has been continually snubbed by manager Alex Ferguson this season. A close friend of Webb told me: \\u2018It doesn't look as though Neil has a future with United. He wants to talk to the boss about it. He is very close to asking for a transfer.\\u2019 Webb, 29, has played for United just once this season \\u2014 in the UEFA Cup tie against Moscow Torpedo \\u2014 and that was only because of the foreigners' rule that restricted Ferguson's choice. When the team for Saturday's game at Tottenham was announced, Webb's name was missing again. Now unless Webb figures in the squad for Wednesday's Coca-Cola Cup home tie against Brighton, he is set for show-down talks. But Fergie might be reluctant to release one of his English midfield players while United are still in the UEFA Cup. I understand that Fergie was offering Webb in part-exchange during the close season and he is still interested in a swap deal involving Chelsea's Andy Townsend. But Stamford Bridge chairman Ken Bates is insisting on \\u00a33million cash for his 29-year-old star. Tottenham and Nottingham Forest would also be interested in Webb if the fee was less than \\u00a31million. Spurs are in need of a creative midfielder since selling Paul Gascoigne and Paul Stewart, while Brian Clough might consider luring Webb back to Forest with his team at the bottom of the Premier League. WEBB: Snubbed Torby's a disaster DANISH star Torben Piechnik hit back yesterday after a nightmare debut which must add fresh fears about Liverpool's future. The 29-year-old cost \\u00a3500,000 from Copenhagen, but he was turned inside out by an Aston Villa side that cruelly exposed his lack of pace. He looked a pale shadow of the commanding centre half who helped Denmark win the European championship, but said: \\u2018I won't crack under the pressure. \\u2018I'm not the sort \\u2014 I'm big and strong, and I can take everything they throw at me on my broad shoulders. \\u2018It's a situation I believe I can handle, given a bit of time.\\u2019 PIECHNIK: Nightmare ACCUSED Man City 0, Chelsea 1 KEN LAWRENCE ANDY TOWNSEND last night refused to back down after going wild over an X-rated tackle that left Dennis Wise in a heap. The Chelsea skipper insisted: \\u2018That is the kind of tackle that can end a player's career \\u2014 and it is one Fitzroy Simpson cannot be proud of. \\u2018I wasn't trying to start a riot or anything like that when I reacted as I did. \\u2018But if one of our lads had done something similar, I would have expected the Manchester City players to respond in the same way. \\u2018I told Fitzroy: \\u2018You are a bloody good player and you don't need to be doing that. One day it could be you in the same position\\u2019. \\u2018I did put my arm around his shoulders at the end and he told me he did not mean anything malicious. I believe him. \\u2018But I don't regret what I did or how I reacted. I am the Chelsea captain and it is my duty to try to protect my players.\\u2019 Protest Townsend had to be forcibly restrained by team-mates after the tackle ignited this live TV clash. His reaction was so wild that he would have found himself in even deeper trouble if he had connected with Simpson. Simpson, booked for the challenge that sparked this flare-up, was the victim of a nasty challenge by Gareth Hall a minute later \\u2014 and Hall also went into referee Keith Hackett's book. But Simpson, a \\u00a3350,000 buy from Swindon, defended himself, saying: \\u2018I saw the ball and went for it. \\u2018My game is about tackling in midfield and how the opposition react is up to them. \\u2018The referee did not stop the game until the Chelsea players started to protest and the linesman did not raise his flag. So why was I booked?\\u2019 Townsend countered: \\u2018Remember we lost our centre-half Paul Elliott through a bad tackle last week. Players have to remember that their livelihoods are at stake. \\u2018I would not have wanted to see either player carted off to hospital because of a tackle like that which was dangerously high. \\u2018Perhaps Dennis also lunged a little bit and Fitzroy was maybe trying to protect him self. But there can be no excuse for what happened.\\u2019 Simpson left Wise writhing and Townsend reacted instantaneously. As he tried to grab Simpson, team-mates Mal Donaghy and Nigel Spackman dived in to pull him back. Then more Chelsea players joined in the manhunt for Simpson. City player-manager Peter Reid also piled in \\u2014 and Townsend was still being restrained after Simpson had been cautioned. Reid said: \\u2018My man went into the tackle and was going for the ball. I know the Chelsea players reacted but it is a passionate game and the tackles do go in.\\u2019 Wise was also centre stage in the incident which led to Chelsea's 40th-minute winner. Hackett judged that City skipper Keith Curle's tackle on Wise was head-high. He gave Chelsea an indirect free-kick in the box which Wise touched to David Lee. His shot was charged down but Mick Harford shot in the rebound. The goal came as City tried to struggle through with 10 men while Rick Holden was having four stitches in a mouth wound after colliding with team-mate Terry Phelan. Holden was missing for 18 minutes and Reid admitted: \\u2018We took a calculated gamble by not replacing Rick \\u2014 and it did not come off.\\u2019 City created several chances but Kevin Hitchcock's return for the disgraced Dave Beasant boosted Chelsea. Hitchcock made fine saves from Simpson, Mike Sheron and David White. Then he responded brilliantly late on to parry a point-blank shot from the ill-starred Simpson. CHELSEA scorer Mick Harford (centre) leads the angry protest against City's Fitzroy Simpson. Picture: ALBERT COOPER TOWNSEND: Wild reaction WISE lies flat out after being felled by Simpson's tackle. 35 YEAR HITCH West Ham 1, Derby 1 NEIL SILVER WEST HAM'S lowest League crowd for 35 years were left wishing they hadn't bothered after this dismal affair. Just 11,493 spectators turned up at Upton Park as ITV kicked off its live Football League coverage to rival Channel 4's Italian action and Sky's Premier League offering. It was the Hammers' lowest gate since 9,500 watched them play Bristol City in 1957. Manager Billy Bonds said: \\u2018I thought we would have got a few back after our last few results, but this seems to be par for the course lately.\\u2019 Striker Trevor Morley, who signed a one-year contract on Friday, celebrated by grabbing West Ham's equaliser, his fourth goal in three games. They had fallen behind to a crazy goal after 33 minutes. Paul Simpson broke free on the left, raced into the box and fired in a low-angled shot which keeper Ludo Miklosko fumbled. Mitchell Thomas tried to hook the ball clear, but it struck Miklosko on the shoulder and flew into the net. But Morley pounced just a minute after the break to give the Hammers the goal their pressure deserved. Mark Robson's corner from the right was helped on by Thomas, Alvin Martin and then Kevin Keen before Morley slotted home from eight yards. BONDS: Disappointed HELLO Lee snubs old boss to join Keegan Magpies steal Charlton ace COLIN DIBALL ROBERT LEE joined Newcastle United last night after turning his back on a move to Premier League Middlesbrough. The \\u00a3700,000 transfer from Charlton went through only 48 hours after Lee rejected the chance to link up again with his former boss Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence's bid broke down largely because of Londoner Lee's reluctance to move to the North. Now, in an amazing snub to Lawrence, the 26-year-old has joined a club which is even further away from the capital and is set to make his debut in the Coca-Cola Cup tomorrow night \\u2014 against Middlesbrough! \\u2018I can understand if Lennie Lawrence is feeling a bit bemused tonight, but he wanted an answer straightaway,\\u2019 said Lee. \\u2018He put me on the spot and eventually pulled out of the deal as much as I did. Lennie wasn't prepared to wait. \\u2018Maybe I'm wrong, but I hope there are no hard feelings. I like to think he would wish me good luck in the future.\\u2019 Keegan insisted: \\u2018There's no animosity between us and Middlesbrough. He had the chance to sign for them and didn't go. \\u2018I don't feel that we've poached him. We didn't arrive on the scene until that deal had fallen down. \\u2018We are nearer than Middlesbrough to London in many ways. We are on the main rail line and there are more flights from Newcastle.\\u2019 Lee revealed that Keegan's presence was a major factor in his decision to join Newcastle. \\u2018Kevin was my idol when I was a youngster,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018His interest was flattering and I felt Newcastle were right for me. \\u2018The lure of Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United was too much \\u2014 and it had to be something big for me to leave London.\\u2019 Keegan was allowed to spend \\u00a3700,000 on Lee because of the huge gates United are attracting this season. \\u2018The supporters have bought him,\\u2019 said Keegan. \\u2018They have enabled us to add a very valuable player to our squad because they are putting their money on the table.\\u2019 Meanwhile, Lawrence refused to get involved in a row following Lee's decision. Lawrence declared last week: \\u2018If Lee doesn't sign for me he won't leave London,\\u2019 after the striker had indicated he did not fancy quitting the capital. That's why Keegan's swoop came as such a shock. Lawrence had insisted: \\u2018Whether he goes or stays is of no concern to me now. \\u2018When I put the phone down on him on Friday that was it. \\u2018Good luck to him. There's no point in moaning and groaning. I'm not in any rush to make a signing. We aren't doing badly, are we?\\u2019 Boro players were stunned by Lee's about-turn \\u2014 especially his former Charlton team-mate Andy Peake. Said Peake: \\u2018I'm surprised. If he was going anywhere I thought he would have come here for Premier League football. \\u2018I thought I was his best friend. Now he's going to get some stick for this!\\u2019 GOTCHA! NEWCASTLE'S Kevin Keegan and Sir John Hall celebrate their new signing Robert Lee (front) LAWRENCE: Snubbed GOODBYE NEWCASTLE striker Mick Quinn wants out of St James's Park \\u2014 after being dropped for Saturday's match against Bristol City. Quinn, who scored three goals in two games against Portsmouth and Grimsby, has met boss Kevin Keegan but seems determined to get away. A source close to the player last night made it clear that he was deeply hurt at being dropped from the match. He said: \\u2018Mick is confused. He doesn't know what he has to do to win a regular first team place.\\u2019 QUINN: Upset Cool Nigel JOHN EDWARDS NIGEL JEMSON last night shrugged aside the most embarrassing moment of his career and ruled out any showdown with Trevor Francis. The Sheffield Wednesday striker was livid at finding himself back on the bench just 28 minutes after being sent on as a second-half substitute at Norwich on Saturday. But he kept his anger under control and vowed to knuckle down and fight for a first-team future. The \\u00a3800,000 signing from Nottingham Forest then paid tribute to the man who has helped transform his fiery character and enable him to take such a setback calmly in his stride \\u2014 player-boss Francis. He said: \\u2018I believe my attitude and fitness have both improved since I signed for Wednesday, and I've got the boss and coach Ritchie Barker to thank for that. \\u2018They have helped and encouraged me to be more professional, and I'm grateful for that. \\u2018I was disappointed at what happened, but I'm not the only one who has been through something like that. \\u2018Trevor himself was taken off after going on as sub last season. \\u2018I didn't like what happened at Norwich. But Trevor told me it was tactical, so I've got to bite my tongue and accept his explanation.\\u2019 Jemson added: \\u2018I know it's going to be difficult breaking into the Wednesday team, with David Hirst and Mark Bright both ahead of me. But I will give it my best shot.\\u2019 JEMSON: Tribute MIDDLESBROUGH have been refused permission by Millwall to play on-loan goalkeeper Brian Horne against Newcastle in the Coca-Cola Cup local derby tomorrow. Neil's war cry NOTTS County boss Neil Warnock, preparing for tonight's Coca Cola Cup first leg against Wolves, has challenged his players: \\u2018Let's see you come out fighting \\u2014 the same as me!\\u2019 Warnock, under fire after a 6-0 blasting by Millwall, said: \\u2018Millwall was a body blow but I've told my players that I've always been a fighter. I'll come out battling \\u2014 but will they?\\u2019 Kenny nicks Nicky MATT HUGHES KENNY Dalglish hopes to clinch the surprise \\u00a3750,000 signing of Plymouth skipper Nicky Marker today. The big-spending Blackburn Rovers boss was locked in talks with Argyle manager Peter Shilton throughout yesterday in an attempt to finalise a player-plus-cash package. Marker, 27, can play in defence or midfield and has a hard-man reputation. Dalglish switched his sights to Marker after failing in a \\u00a32.5million bid for Craig Short. The deal also involves two young Blackburn squad players going to Plymouth in exchange. Shilton wants winger Craig Skinner, who has been on loan at the club, and centre-half Keith Hill, who is valued at \\u00a3250,000. MARKER: Target Danny's his boy WALTER STOREY WORRIED Sunderland boss Malcolm Crosby is ready to thrash out a \\u00a3250,000 deal for Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Danny Wilson. Crosby is determined to buy this week to halt the Roker slide down the First Division table. Bookies pay out on coup CHARLES FAWCUS JO N JACK'S supporters will get their money today after BOLA finally advised its members to pay up. The Betting Shop association had been looking into the  circumstances surrounding the horse's win at Lingfield two weeks ago. That success at 33-1 was cleared by the Jockey Club and the police last week, but BOLA surprisingly continued to hold out. There was almost no money on course for the horse and the only serious cash, about \\u00a31,000 in a series of small bets, was placed in the Bradford area. One winning punter, Chris Welham, said: \\u2018The bookies only squealed because we beat them.\\u2019 Too true and how many attempted coups have gone wrong and the cash has been lost without any question of an inquiry. BOLA keeps insisting that it is looking after the interest of all punters by examining the details of this affair and issuing the \\u2018No pay\\u2019 edict. But this was just a shrewd touch that came off. The betting shops got caught and didn't like it. BOLA council member Peter Smith, one of the bookmakers hit, said: \\u2018If this happened again then I would bring it to BOLA's attention.\\u2019 A 33-1 chance is unlikely to crop up in this week's top event, the Queen Elizabeth 11 Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, which sees the re-match between Selkirk and Marling. Rodrigo De Triano also figures in the entries and will take his chance if the ground stays as he likes it. \\u2018THE WORST LIVERPOOL SIDE FOR 33 YEARS\\u2019 EVEN THE BOOKIES ARE READY FOR AN ANFIELD SHAKE-UP It could take him five seasons to get it right EMLYN HUGHES/NIGEL CLARKE A SINISTER campaign to boot Graeme Souness out of Liverpool went public last night when the betting boys opened a book on his successor. Kevin Keegan, the current darling of Tyneside, is already being quoted 5-1 to be in charge at Anfield when Liverpool start the Premier League next season. Although William Hills make Souness the 6-4 on favourite to remain manager next year, it's still a shattering blow to his credibility. Along with Keegan, all the other Kop favourites are being lined up to depose the Scottish hard-man. There's John Toshack, who has won his managerial spurs with Spain's top clubs, at 6-1 and former boss Kenny Dalglish \\u2014 now a hit at Blackburn \\u2014 quoted 8-1. Difficult Even Alan Hansen, who has retired to the TV studios, is a 10-1 shot. Then comes Oldham chief Joe Royle, once a hero with arch-rivals Everton, at 12-1 and current Goodison boss Howard Kendall at 14-1. Manchester City player-manager Peter Reid is 20-1 along with former Liverpool star Sammy Lee and Howard Wilkinson, boss of champions Leeds. The bookies chalked up their prices as Liverpool have staggered to their worst start for 28 years. And ex-skipper Emlyn Hughes, who captained the Reds to an incredible 13 trophies, says: \\u2018It is the worst side for 33 years. \\u2018No wonder Souness is having such a difficult time. What is happening at Anfield now would make Bill Shankly, the man who was my idol, turn in his grave. \\u2018I hear all the arguments about injuries, loss of form and man management. The truth is that Liverpool are nowhere near getting out of their rut of despair. \\u2018A campaign has already begun suggesting that Souness is for the chop \\u2014 but I blame the players. \\u2018I know he has made mistakes, but for the first time since Shanks took over in 1959, a Liverpool manager has got a job to do. \\u2018Souness has inherited the biggest mess at Anfield that I can remember and in trying to get himself out of it he has at times become even more bogged down. \\u2018But with injuries that have cut the heart from the side, Souness has had to buy \\u2014 and he's not always been successful. \\u2018While the critics are erecting the hangman's gallows for him, it is his players who have let Liverpool down. \\u2018I see no captain on the bridge, no leader, no will to win or passion to play for the club. \\u2018Souness can sweat his own blood and tears for Liverpool \\u2014 but sees few others ready to show that kind of commitment. \\u2018When Dalglish went what did Souness inherit? A team and a club on the slide. Players bought who had nothing to do with the Liverpool way of life. \\u2018Suddenly Souness had to start from the bottom and try to build not just from an injury-decimated side, but from one whose senior players were in the most part over 30 and past it. \\u2018He has tried to draft in fresh faces, and found it difficult for them to fit in. \\u2018I don't fancy Mark Wright as a skipper \\u2014 or even a centre half. \\u2018He has gone backwards. But who else is there? No wonder Souness has been into the transfer market for a new centre back. \\u2018And what about Mark Walters? He shows nothing that suggests to me he should wear a Liverpool shirt. I see no heart and soul for the job. \\u2018I know critics will say that Souness picks the team, and they reflect his selection. But he hasn't much of a choice. \\u2018He has had to play kids because the cupboard is bare. And the stars he does have are not going to get any better. \\u2018Souness doesn't have any money to spend like Dalglish did. He has had to gamble on selling before he can buy, that's why he got rid of first Ray Houghton and then Dean Saunders. \\u2018He took over a team in turmoil \\u2014 and it might take him five years to get it right. \\u2018Will the club be that patient? While the bookies adjust their odds, the pressure builds for him.\\u2019 DOWN GRAEME SOUNESS (far left) and his staff have that sinking feeling. DREAM TEAM: Bill Shankly's prize guys of 1966\\u2026but how things have changed at Anfield SOUNESS 4-6 KEEGAN 5-1 TOSHACK 6-1 DALGLISH 8-1 HANSEN 10-1 ROYLE 12-1 KENDALL 14-1 REID 20-1 WILKINSON 20-1 Blame Taylor claims Irish WALTER STOREY FORMER Irish international Eamon Dunphy has launched a blistering attack on Graham Taylor \\u2014 and gone to war against a host of other top football personalities. Speaking about legendary Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby, Dunphy choked back tears as he said: \\u2018Busby was the last football man with vision. \\u2018Compare his dream to people like Vinny Jones, Ken Bates and Graham Taylor. What the **** has Taylor ever done?\\u2019 Dunphy, capped 22 times by the Republic of Ireland, added: \\u2018We need to winkle out people like Bates, and we don't need an England manager like Taylor.\\u2019 Dunphy blamed Taylor for the failings of the English national side. \\u2018The European championship showed that decline is unique to the English game. \\u2018There's no place for individuals any more. \\u2018English football has been dead for a decade now,\\u2019 he added. Turning his scorn on to Republic of Ireland boss Jack Charlton, Dunphy snorted: \\u2018They play like Wimbledon, yet he's regarded as a hero! It's the age of the blind and the deaf.\\u2019 The former Millwall star, now a writer and broadcaster, stunned the packed audience at a football evening at Waterstone's Bookshop in London's Charing Cross Road as he laid into more of the game's major figures. Dunphy also blasted pundits Trevor Brooking and Bob Wilson for \\u2018glibness and stupidity\\u2019. Even Crystal Palace boss Steve Coppell was not spared. \\u2018Coppell's regarded as intelligent because he's been to university,\\u2019 the Irishman said. \\u2018But he talks a lot of tripe about football, and his team's a disgrace.\\u2019 TAYLOR: Blasted SILENCE OF THE LAMB! Special on the man who told the truth No faith, let's hope for charity! MIKE LANGLEY I'VE no faith in the disciplinary tribunal of the Test and County Cricket Board. They look mostly the same breed of numbskulls who've been mishandling the Allan Lamb case for a month. Ditherers and mums-the-worders who'd make even the fossilised Football Association Council look like a Brains Trust. I said from the outset that, in the eyes of the TCCB, the MCC and the International Cricket Council, the gouging of a cricket ball is a lesser crime than rocking the boat. Nothing has happened since to contradict that judgment. Indeed, hardly a day has passed without some fresh damned-foolery to strengthen it. Lamb alerted the umpires at Lord's to Pakistan bowling with a ball showing signs of unnatural wear. \\u2018It's been tampered with,\\u2019 he said. The ball was duly examined, confiscated and changed \\u2014 without one official, convincing word of straight-from-the-shoulder explanation. Frantic Lord's silence over Lamb has been broken only by the swish, frantic swish of sweeping every inconvenient fact under the Long Room carpet, now piled so high that Chris Bonnington might not scale it! I won't go again through the details of the Fax that failed, the chairman who was uncontactable by phone, the urgent letters posted second-class \\u2014 and \\u2018the statement that never was\\u2019 delivered by the secretary as he disappeared on holiday. Yes, we'll skip all that. Today provides a more immediate issue- the final opportunity for cricket to show it's not administered entirely by blithering idiots. Eddie Slinger of Lancashire and his tribunal are almighty. They can double or treble the two-match suspension and \\u00a31,800 fine that Northants imposed immediately on skipper Lamb for exposing the ball-fiddle by speaking out without his county's permission. But chairman Slinger also has the power to ask his eight-man jury: \\u2018How can we punish a chap for telling the truth, even if he has breached his contract? \\u2018Won't folk be saying it's us, not Allan Lamb, who are bringing the game into disrepute by acting out a lie and covering up for Pakistan's bowlers? So perhaps we ought to treat the lad reet leniently. Any suggestions?\\u2019 Yes, Mr Chairman. No fines, no further suspensions. Send Lamb a reprimand, instead. Second-class post. Langley's verdict on August 29 MIRROR SPORT, August 27 MIRROR SPORT, August 28 MIRROR SPORT, August 29 WALTER'S SO LUCKY CHARLES FAWCUS WALTER SWINBURN struck back at Kempton yesterday and now he can't wait for Marling's return at Ascot on Saturday. Swinburn was knocked down in a late night incident in Newmarket a month ago \\u2014 and rates himself lucky to be riding again at all. . \\u2018I hit my head on the kerb when I fell and when I went to hospital two days later they told me I had severe bruising of the brain,\\u2019 said Walter after his Kempton win on Mithl Al Hawa. \\u2018When I came out again my weight had gone down to 8 stone and it's definitely an experience I wouldn't like to go through again, but it gives you a new outlook on life. \\u2018I got 500 get well cards and I'm really grateful to the people who sent them. It feels as if I'm starting the season again and obviously I'm not 100yet, but I will be for Marling on Saturday. \\u2018I rode her in a bit of work on Saturday morning and she felt great. It's going to be tough on Saturday but she won't mind the rain which might frighten one or two away.\\u2019 Walter gave crack sprinter Sheikh Albadou a spin yesterday morning and he flies to New York to ride the horse in a pre-Breeders Cup race on Saturday week. Then he makes a lightning trip back on Concorde for Petit Loup in the Arc a few hours later. Selkirk is 6-4 favourite to beat Marling on Saturday and his trainer Ian Balding was smiling in the rain at Kempton yesterday. \\u2018It was like this when he won the Queen Elizabeth last year so I won't mind if it keeps pouring down for him or Lochsong,\\u2019 he said. His Ayr Gold Cup heroine is right on song for a farewell appearance for the year in the Diadem Stakes on Saturday. \\u2018She came back from Scotland in fine form and it's certainly looking as though she'll run again,\\u2019 he added. Laburnum, just beaten at the last Kempton meeting after being off the course since April, was the big weekend gamble yesterday. Ladbrokes cut his price from 12-1 to half those odds for Ascot's Krug Trophy. ALL GUNS BLAZING GEORGE GRAHAM takes his misfiring Gunners into Coca-Cola Cup battle tonight at Highbury against old club Millwall admitting his team are not yet good enough. He said: \\u2018With the talent we've got we should be doing better \\u2014 we are still not playing well enough.\\u2019 GRAHAM: Frank We're here to win NEIL SILVER THE FORMER colleagues of Paul Gascoigne at Spurs would like nothing better than to spoil his comeback tonight. Gazza makes his Lazio debut against his old club and his Tottenham pals aren't going to give him an easy ride. Captain Gary Mabbutt, who hopes to make his first appearance of the season after injury, said: \\u2018The game may be only a friendly but there is a lot of prestige involved. \\u2018The match is being beamed back to White Hart Lane and you always want to look good in front of the cameras.\\u2019 And that means there is no question of special treatment for Gazza. \\u2018We will definitely put Paul to the test,\\u2019 Mabbutt said. \\u2018He came over and trained with us last week and he was looking fit. \\u2018Gazza has always been brilliant on the football field and it will be great to see him back after the long haul he's had.\\u2019 Spurs\\u2019 defender Neil Ruddock never played with Gazza but has lined up against him and he said: \\u2018I've only played against him once and I couldn't get near him. \\u2018Obviously we won't be deliberately kicking Gazza up in the air. \\u2018All the lads at Spurs talk about Gazza and what a great player he is. I know he's had a long time out with injury but he must be all right now or he wouldn't be playing.\\u2019 MABBUTT: Prestige RUDDOCK: Big game Crosby's Bogie-man MALCOLM CROSBY, the Sunderland manager, is bidding to tie up a loan deal for Millwall's Ian Bogie \\u2014 a player once dubbed the new Gazza. But Crosby faces a snag, with Lions boss Mick McCarthy wanting his striker, John Byrne, in exchange. Bogie was given the chance to replace Paul Gascoigne at Newcastle, when Gazza went to Spurs, but failed to establish himself. BELL HAS APPEAL Mean Dean's set to boss the champs MARTIN RICHARDS SKIPPER Dean Bell will be front-runner to take over as Wigan coach when John Monie goes back to Australia next May. That was the strong inside bet from Central Park yesterday as the champions angrily denied they had made a move for Sydney St George coach Brian Smith to succeed Monie. Former Hull coach Smith, who has agreed a new 12-month contract with St George, claims he has had two offers to return to England for the 1993-4 season. \\u2018There's not a grain of truth in the Smith stories and it's unsettling for the club,\\u2019 said Wigan chairman Jack Robinson. Leeds new centre signing Kevin Iro won't make his debut for at least six weeks after a specialist said that the Kiwi international's injury was worse than first feared. Iro originally hoped he would be sidelined for only two weeks. He picked up the injury playing against Great Britain in July and aggravated it in his last match for Manly. BELL: Coach bid IRO: Out 6 weeks Rory's return RORY Underwood, England's most-capped player and record try-scorer, has dramatically reversed his decision to retire from international rugby. Underwood, who has scored 35 tries in 55 England appearances, will be available for the \\u2018foreseeable future\\u2019 and will tour New Zealand with the British Lions next summer. Bill's game plan NEIL SILVER BILL Nicholson, the man who led Tottenham to the League and FA Cup \\u2018double\\u2019 in 1961, last night slammed the modern game for failing to provide value. And the former Spurs boss, whose push-and-run team of the 1960's included such soccer legends as Danny Blanchflower and Dave Mackay, called for revolutionary changes. \\u2018I can't understand how people can pay excessive amounts to watch football the way it is played today,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I watched Tottenham play Brentford on Monday night and I was very disappointed with what I saw. \\u2018In my day, it was all about players finding space. \\u2018I want to see something happening in the game, something that helps the players and the spectators to enjoy it \\u2014 but how can it happen when players are congested in seven-and-a-half yards either side of the halfway line?\\u2019 Nicholson called for the introduction of a major change in the offside law. He believes two white lines should be drawn across the width of the pitch, one in each half 15 yards from the centre spot. \\u2018Inside those 30 yards we should say you can't be offside,\\u2019 he explained. NICHOLSON: Ideas JOHN'S TOP OF THE OPS C Palace 3, Lincoln 1 TONY STENSON MIRACLE man John Salako last night showed Paul Gascoigne the way to bounce back from serious injury. Palace's former England forward struck a glorious goal to serve Graham Taylor notice that he's worth another try. Salako, once part of Taylor's new dawn, severed two tendons and had to fly to America for \\u00a3100,000 of treatment. But while Gazza is still to test his recovery, Salako returned at the start of this season and last night played a majestic role in Palace's first leg Coca-Cola Cup win. He was behind most of the attacks that usually floundered at the hands, feet or body of Lincoln's inspired keeper Ian Bowling \\u2014 who played for most of the game with a suspected smashed ankle. Palace manager Steve Coppell said: \\u2018Everything we get from John now is a bonus because we did fear the worst. The money we spent on the operation was worth it.\\u2019 Gareth Southgate fired in Palace's opener from 25 yards in the 19th minute then Salako scored on the hour. The lively Eddie McGoldrick grabbed Palace's third before Graham Bressington gave Lincoln scant second leg hope just before the end. SALAKO: Inspired Up for t'Cup PAUL Gascoigne felt he was going to pot without his favourite cuppa \\u2014 so he asked a friend to bring some English tea-bags out to Rome. And he's hoping to brew up a shock for his old mates tonight. SHAMED No-hopers shake Kop in 8-goal drama Souness on rack Liverpool 4, Chesterf'ld 4 RICHARD TANNER LIVERPOOL manager Graeme Souness last night refused to discuss the goals that Mark Wright and David James gave away to a team of Third Division nobodies. Shamed Souness said: \\u2018I'd rather not talk about the goals we gave away and concentrate instead on the  pluses .\\u2019 England centre-half Wright and costly keeper James will doubtless be on the receiving of their manager's tongue today \\u2014 after being humiliated by two unknown strikers the wrong side of thirty. Pressure Last night ex-Halifax striker Steve Norris was doing much of the talking after hitting Liverpool with two goals. \\u2018We'll finish them off in a fortnight,\\u2019 he said, as he celebrated 31st birthday. Chesterfield came within a whisker of shocking Liverpool in this amazing Coca Cola Cup-tie. His strike partner Dave Lancaster also snatched two goals as Chesterfield led 3-0 and then 4-2 in a match that will only pile the pressure on Souness. But Liverpool, facing their biggest Cup humiliation since their 1959 defeat by non-League Worcester, escaped with late goals from Mark Walters and skipper Wright. Wright's face-saving equaliser came five minutes from time \\u2014 after he had endured a nightmare display. Souness, while hugely relieved that his team got out of jail, was furious with the goals they leaked \\u2014 with Wright and James the prime culprits. He said: \\u2018We played some really good football and showed some tremendous character considering we had so many young players out there. Minute \\u2018We hit the post in the last minute. Had that gone in, I think it would have been justice because of the way our players responded. \\u2018Chesterfield worked hard but we made things easy for them with the goals we gave away.\\u2019 But Norris, who launched his career at non-league VS Rugby and Telford, said: \\u2018That's a birthday I will never forget. \\u2018If someone had said we would get a draw here, we would have been well happy. \\u2018But the lads were disappointed in the end  because we threw it away. \\u2018But scoring four goals at Anfield is brilliant. Now we are all looking forward to the second leg. If we play as well as that I don't see why we can't finish them off. \\u2018You dream about scoring at Anfield \\u2014 but to do it both ends and to silence the Kop is a fantastic feeling.\\u2019 Two-goal Lancaster said: \\u2018We thought there might be eight goals tonight \\u2014 but we didn't think we would get four of them!.\\u2019 Manager Chris McMenemy, son of England number two Lawrie, said: \\u2018This is the proudest night of my football life. It's all we could have hoped for. \\u2018In fact, the lads are upset because at 3-0 up they should have been home and dry. But I don't think they could believe what was happening \\u2014 and nor could I. \\u2018I don't care what troubles Liverpool may have. They are still a great club and they had several internationals out there.\\u2019 Souness will now conduct a major inquest into Liverpool's defensive shambles. It was the first time they had conceded four goals at home since the Manchester United of Charlton, Law and Best rammed four past them in 1969. And Souness will desperately hope that some of his eight injured stars will be back to face bogey side Wimbledon at Anfield on Saturday. Liverpool are already in the grip of their worst League start to a season since 1953 \\u2014 and this amazing result will have done little to restore confidence. Already the bookies are taking bets on whether Souness will still be in the Anfield hot seat neat season. Another blow was the crowd of 12,533 \\u2014 the lowest at Anfield since 1945. STEVE NORRIS races in to beat David James for Chesterfield's first goal \\u2014 and an astonishing night at Anfield is under way. Norris ended with two goals, as did fellow striker Dave Lancaster. HEROES: Chesterfield's two-goal strikers Steve Norris and Dave Lancaster salute the crowd at Anfield WORRIED: Graeme Souness last night FELLED Wright eyeful NIGEL CLARKE ARSENAL striker Ian Wright was hit in the face by a coin thrown from the crowd during the 1-1 Coca-Cola Cup draw against Millwall at Highbury. Arsenal manager George Graham said: \\u2018Ian was hit just above the eye. I believe the referee is going to put it in his report, but luckily Ian was unmarked and not badly hurt.\\u2019 Six players were booked, four of them from Arsenal taking the team's tally of yellow cards for the season to 21. MATCH REPORT \\u2014 Page 30, 31. FACING TROUBLE: Arsenal's Ian Wright is treated at Highbury after being hit in the face by a coin thrown from the crowd PROUD CHESTERFIELD boss Chris McMenemy got a special pat on the back for his team's Coca-Cola Cup draw at Liverpool \\u2014 from proud dad Lawrie. The England number two was on his way to see Gazza play in Rome when he phoned his son. \\u2018He sounded pleased as punch for me,\\u2019 beamed Chris, \\u2018and he said the whole family were absolutely delighted. It was great to hear from him.\\u2019 McMENEMY: Delighted PHEW-NITED Brighton 1 Man Utd 1 TONY STENSON MATT EDWARDS used the Coca-Cola Cup to finally come in from the wilderness last night. Edwards, one of soccer's wandering gypsies, returned home to keep this second round, first leg tie on knife-edge with a brilliant 73rd minute goal. The 21-year-old Edwards, London born, and once on Brighton's books, was tossed out by Spurs this summer after being farmed without impact to Reading and Peterborough. He eventually rejoined Brighton on a free transfer \\u2014 and last night, at last, he enjoyed a taste of the good life. Edwards revealed he knew his days at Spurs were numbered when then-manager Peter Shreeves forgot his name! He said: \\u2018We were in training and everyone was having goal attempts. Peter got round to me and said \\u2018sorry son, I've forgotten who you are.\\u2019 I knew it was time to move. \\u2018I saw Terry Venables and he agreed. Now it's nice to show them I am really around.\\u2019 His goal was a gem for the Seagulls \\u2014 but it left United manager Alex Ferguson fuming: \\u2018There was a slackness right through our side \\u2014 only Danny Wallace played as though he meant it.\\u2019 Brighton, relegated from Division Two last season, constantly had United in trouble. Even Wallace's goal late in the first half did not deflect their determination. The last time these clubs met was at Wembley in the 1983 FA Cup final, a game that needed two bites for United before they finally ran out winners. Steve Foster, his famous headband constantly leaping ahead of Mark Hughes and Brian McClair, is sole survivor of those far-off days. Brighton, now \\u00a34m in debt and losing \\u00a31,000 a day, will reap almost \\u00a3100,000 from the two games \\u2014 and few will deny them their rich pickings. United's star keeper keeper Peter Schmeichel was on international duty with Denmark. But his deputy, Gary Walsh, was their hero, constantly in the action. It took Wallace to finally offer United hope. Ince, taking a return from his own shot, put the little winger clear to rifle in his first goal of the season on 36 minutes. But the equaliser was always on offer and arrived in the 73rd minute. Ian Chapman, booked earlier for fouling Andrei Kanchelskis, provided the cross that Edwards rose to head home. WALLACE: On target ALERT RED: Brian McClair slips past a challenge by Brighton's Steve Foster during last night's hectic battle at the Goldstone Grant grabs title IAN GIBB HEROL Graham's reign as British middleweight champion ended last night as Bradford's Frank Grant blasted him to a ninth-round defeat at Elland Road, Leeds. The master craftsman was left helpless as referee Paul Thomas called it off after two minutes 20 seconds of the ninth. Up to then Graham, 33, had been mainly in control and had at times outclassed the 27-year-old Grant. But he was taking far too many punches which at one time he would have slipped with ease. Grant blazed forward in the ninth with a big right and left and Graham was down. He got to one knee but had to stay down until the count reached nine. Another right on the jaw had Herol collapsing back in a corner. He managed to get away to the other side of the ring but Grant, who calls himself The Terminator, slashed away with both hands, forcing the stoppage. IAN GIBB Henry Wharton added the British super-middleweight title to his Commonwealth crown by the narrowest of margins. British champion Fidel Castro Smith fought hard and bravely to hang on to his title, losing only by 118 to 117 1/2 points Sheals shame Leigh 14, Oldham 26 OLDHAM prop Mark Sheals, signed from Leigh this summer, was sent off on his first trip back to Hilton Park. He was dismissed by Widnes referee David Campbell in the 36th minute for a high tackle on his ex-team-mate Andy Ruane. But the Second Division battlers clinched a Lancashire Cup semi-final spot with the help of two touchdowns from winger Scott Ranson who took his tally to 13 in 14 matches since his arrival from Swinton last season. RODRIGO'S RAINED OFF CHRIS JUDGE THE weather has put a real dampener on Saturday's Festival of British Racing at Ascot with some of its biggest stars ready to pull out. The downpour that caused flooding in many areas of the country yesterday hit the Berkshire track and two inches of rain reduced the going to soft from good. With such conditions Rodrigo de Triano is almost certain to miss the meeting's highlight, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, while Second Set and Brief Truce could also be absentees. Top two-year-old Sayyedati is also considered doubtful for the Fillies' Mile. But clerk of the course Nicholas Beaumont is still optimistic about an improvement. \\u2018I haven't conceded that we have lost Rodrigo de Triano yet. I spoke to Peter Chapple-Hyam this morning and he told me he hadn't decided what to do. Reluctant \\u2018The course dries very quickly and the ground is sure to be better on the old course. We will have to wait and see.\\u2019 Chapple-Hyam has warned for some days that he is reluctant to risk Rodrigo de Triano, winner of the English and Irish 2,000 Guineas, on soft ground. Second Set, whose disappointing fourth in the race last year was blamed on soft ground, could also be pulled out. Hills pushed out his price from 8-1 to 14-1 yesterday and there were still no takers. Irish challenger Brief Truce could also miss the race, though he proved he could handle the soft when chasing home All At Sea, who will love the ground, in the Prix du Moulin. Hills cut Selkirk to 11-8 favourite from 13-8 and then offer 7-2 All At Sea (from 6-1) and Marling (from 3-1). Marling has yet to encounter such conditions and trainer Geoff Wragg warned: \\u2018I will have to play it by ear but as long as it is only soft we should be all right. However, if it gets bottomless then I would think everyone will be pulling out in hordes.\\u2019 Conditions At Ascot today Two Left Feet should enjoy the conditions after an impressive victory on similar ground at Ripon. His run at Haydock last time is best ignored as George Duffield got himself jammed in on the rails until too late. ANGRY COLUMN PETER SHAW POOR old Neil Webb \\u2014 forgotten but never forgiven. He hasn't a chance of getting his wish and leaving Manchester United! After the way Mark Robins has exposed Alex Ferguson's lack of judgment by shooting Norwich to the top of the Premier League, the Old Trafford boss will never dare risk a repeat with Webb. And don't, in your snide comment, make the mistake of thinking I'm a Manchester City fan. I've been a true Red for 30 years and more. \\u2014 Would I do that? Anyway who needs City fans with Reds like you? Red raw GRAEME Souness has ruined Liverpool. The club that once prided itself on having so few injuries they could field the same team week in week out now has so many invalids they are lucky to have the same side two games running. Worse still, injuries are offered as excuses for poor performances. They never were under Shankly, Paisley, Fagan or Dalglish. My bet is that Liverpool won't win anything this year and Souness will get the sack. And the sooner the better!\\u2014 Ten out of ten, pal. That's for your spite. You get one out of ten for logic. Empty box I COULDN'T tell whether I was watching a world title fight or Come Dancing last weekend. It is no wonder Chris Eubank can go 33 fights without defeat when he spends most of the bout running away. His display against Tony Thornton was a travesty. The American at least deserved a draw. Eubank never stops telling us he hates boxing. I have news for him: I hate watching him box. \\u2014 So why bother? Mind you, one look at Come Dancing and you'll soon be back to Eubank. Ref-raff BLACKBURN'S Kenny Dalglish and Joe Kinnear of Wimbledon are the latest Premier League managers to have a serious go at referees. Before them was Howard Wilkinson and Alex Ferguson. I am a referee in a junior league and can tell that ungrateful lot that even in such a comparative stress-free environment, it is not an easy job. When managers have to make decisions, they have time on their side \\u2014 and yet are not always right. How would they fare if the decisions had to be made in split seconds? Very badly is my verdict. \\u2014 That's my verdict, too, pal. Just as badly, in fact, as all the refs I have seen so far. SURPRISE OFFER'S big-race warm up almost turned to disaster at Brighton yesterday today. Richard Hannon's 1-8 favourite appeared ill at ease on the switchback track and scrambled home by the shortest of short heads from Troon. Surprise Offer was running without blinkers and Hannon said: \\u2018He'll definitely wear them for his next race, the Cornwallis Stakes at Ascot.\\u2019 DON'T TELL THE TRUTH Test chief's stark message to cricket Bosses butcher Lamb! CHRIS LANDER ENGLISH cricket yesterday finally became the sport in which it is a crime to tell the truth. The outrageous fine of \\u00a35,000 plus \\u00a31,000 costs imposed on England batsman Allan Lamb will act as the ultimate deterrent to every English professional cricketer who may want to speak out about some scandal, corruption or evil practice in their sport. England cricketers have already been cowed into submission in recent days over discussing publicly the \\u2018Lambgate Affair\\u2019 which has rocked cricket. Privately, they have backed Lamb and admired him for disclosing the Pakistanis' ball-scuffing skulduggery. Now they will be scared rigid of stepping up and saying anything which could land them on the same mat upon which Lamb was so unfairly punished at Lord's yesterday. A number of England players were horrified on hearing of the draconian sentence passed on Lamb \\u2014 who has 28 days in which to lodge an appeal \\u2014 as a top-up sanction following a fine and suspension from his county, Northants. Disgusted Their overall verdict on the high and mighty bunch of Test and County Cricket Board disciplinary committee men was \\u2018What a load of balls!\\u2019 They are disgusted with a decision which must kill off the all-important chance of exposing a form of cheating that has spread with alarming haste as bowlers find ways of getting the old ball to swing violently late. Cricketers the world over, and England's highly-respected umpires in particular, were stunned after the TCCB more than doubled Lamb's original fine, which was already a maximum for a county committee to impose. One player told me: \\u2018At the end of the day, you would have thought Lambie had committed some form of cricketing treason instead of merely having the guts to reveal the Pakistanis\\u2019 ball-tampering trickery in an unauthorised Daily Mirror newspaper article.\\u2019 Another well-known cricketer said: \\u2018I wish I could let this appear under my name, but Lord knows what the Board would do with me! It's a total farce that Lambie can be hit so hard a second time. \\u2018Cricket must now be the only sport in which you can be punished for the same offence twice and, who knows, maybe three times if he appeals! \\u2018You just have to wonder if those members of the disciplinary committee really care about where the game is going at international level. \\u2018Do they truly want to stamp out ball-gouging? They must know it's been going on at domestic and international level for a long time. \\u2018We are aware that a number of incidents have been reported but sweet FA seems to have been done about it.\\u2019 There is one umpire itching to tell all about the drama of that momentous lunch interval during the Texaco Trophy one-day match at Lord's which sparked the biggest row in modern cricket. John Hampshire and Ken Palmer, umpires on the day, are mystified as to why their official match report has not been made known. And match referee Deryck Murray remains baffled as to why his report has been tucked away in some International Cricket Council file. Board spokesman Ken Lawrence said: \\u2018Allan Lamb was in breach of his contract with Northampton, and also the England agreement which forbids comments about international matches for a minimum of two years without permission.\\u2019 Lamb's solicitor Alan Herd, who represented him at the 50-minute hearing, said: \\u2018Allan is very unhappy with the decision and is urgently considering an appeal to the Cricket Council. \\u2018I also want to point out we have been refused access to the match referee's and umpires\\u2019 reports as to the reasons for the change of ball on August 23.\\u2019 The great game of cricket is now in danger of becoming the sport in which everyone is frightened of telling the truth. If they do, they know the price \\u2014 ask Allan Lamb. ALLAN PAYS HEAVY PRICE A stony-faced Allan Lamb leaves the hearing at Lord's yesterday. He is considering an appeal against his \\u00a35,000 fine with \\u00a31,000 costs. ALLAN PAYS HEAVY PRICE A stony-faced Allan Lamb leaves the hearing at Lord's yesterday. He is considering an appeal against his \\u00a35,000 fine with \\u00a31,000 costs. MIRROR SPORT, August 26 MIRROR SPORT, August 28 MIRROR SPORT, August 29 You're all gagged! THE England squad for the controversial Texaco one-day internationals against Pakistan: Gooch, Stewart, Smith, Hick, Botham, Lewis, Fairbrother, DeFreitas, Reeve, Illingworth, Small, and Cork Nothing like the Danes EUROPEAN champions Denmark were held to a  goalless draw by Lithuania in a World Cup Group Three qualifier in Vilnius. Midfielder Kim Christorfe missed a penalty for the Danes. ITV deal on cards FRANK WIECHULA ITV could stage their own Snatch of the Day for FA Cup ties and England internationals. A proposed \\u00a372 million deal between BSkyB and the FA is under threat and ITV could be the winners. FA chief executive Graham Kelly did not want BSkyB to screen Paul Gascoigne's Lazio comeback last night for fear of poor gates at home. But BSkyB took the FA to court. Trevor East, executive producer for ITV Sport, said: \\u2018We are watching the situation.\\u2019 KELLY: Request Well played FRANK WIECHULA ALLAN LAMB, hammered by the TCCB, is a hero with the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. They rang us to reveal all the good work Lamb does for them \\u2014 one of many messages of support for him. Fund-raising director Patricia Feltham said: \\u2018In the middle of everything that's going on, Allan spent two hours on Monday helping with a promotional video. He is most incredibly supportive. \\u2018Last year he organised a fund-raising match for us and it raised \\u00a351,000 net. \\u2018He turns up at absolutely everything we ask. One morning he batted on to an unbeaten hundred. \\u2018He had a shower, changed, leaped on to a train and came straight to London for a 3pm charity gathering. \\u2018He's got a two-year-old son called Richard and they were told he had cystic fibrosis. They had the most horrendous ten days waiting for the tests, only to find Richard hadn't got it. \\u2018Most people would have simply said \\u2018Thank God for that\\u2019 and done nothing more. But not Allan.\\u2019 TV swoop ITV are poised to cover the FA Cup and England internationals as a proposed \\u00a372 million deal between BSkyB and the FA is under threat. Lindsey to the rescue COLIN PRICE ALLAN Lamb's day got off to the worst possible start as flooding in London forced a quick change of travel plans. He had intended to go to Lord's by train \\u2014 instead his wife Lindsey drove them from Northampton. The \\u2018jury\\u2019 took 50 minutes to consider the evidence. Chairman Eddie Slinger said: \\u2018The committee took the view that there had been a deliberate and flagrant breach of Board regulations which Mr Lamb admitted were designed not only for the benefit of the Board but all registered cricketers. \\u2018He is an experienced player who acknowledged that he was fully aware that under his contractual responsibilities he was forbidden to make unauthorised public statements. \\u2018The committee took into account his exemplary record, his contribution to the game, both with his county and nationally, and also the fine and suspension imposed by Northamptonshire.\\u2019 LINDSEY: Duty driver NORWAY ALERT Norway 2, Holland 1 NIGEL CLARKE ENGLAND will desperately need Paul Gascoigne's skills for the World Cup qualifier against Norway at Wembley next month. Little Norway stunned Holland here with a shock win and they now have four points from two games after already beating San Marino 10-0. It was their greatest result since they beat England 2-1 here nine years ago. And it left boss Graham Taylor saying: \\u2018This was no fluke and they worked hard for each other. But I am not going to go overboard \\u2014 I expect us to beat them.\\u2019 Kjetil Rekdal's penalty gave Norway the lead but Dennis Bergkamp stroked in an equaliser 30 seconds later. Goeran Soerloth smashed the winner 11 minutes from time after a Ronald Koeman blunder. Allan Lamb and the DAILY MIRROR WE'LL PAY HIS \\u00a35,000 CRICKET FINE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT At least he'll get justice from us MIKE LANGLEY THE Daily Mirror will pay the \\u00a35,000 fine imposed on Allan Lamb. Our offer was made promptly and proudly yesterday to honour Lamb's bravery in ripping aside a cover-up which is shielding cricket cheats. But our cheque won't be handed over meekly to the Test and County Cricket Board. Never that! We'd rather fling the money in their faces as a mark of defiance by our readers. The Mirror cannot kow-tow before a disciplinary tribunal whose feudal justice was dispensed from the appropriate setting of a committee room tucked between a Real Tennis court and the Lord's museum. Real Tennis is a high-class game even older than the Long Room's most ancient inmate. Henry VIII played it. If only bluff King Hal had been around yesterday, I think the tribunal might have co-opted him to pronounce the sentence they'd love to carry out on Lamb: \\u2018Off with his head!\\u2019. They were icily formal with Lamb yesterday. Not a glimmer of warmth or admiration indicated that the man before them was actually one of the only two England batsmen to hit six centuries against West Indies. The other is Sir Colin Cowdrey who, as president of the International Cricket Council, has been playing the deadest of bats lately. He has been stonewalling throughout the whole month since Lamb told the world, through the Daily Mirror, how the Pakistanis scuff and scrape and scoop at an old ball until it swings as though it was factory fresh. I can't see that Cowdrey knew what was going on among the fielders while Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram bowled. But if he didn't find out, he's out of touch and shouldn't be in his high office. Everybody else in cricket claims to have been aware and says so readily. But they always do so anonymously because every playing contract contains a self-signed gag. Lamb alone tore that stopper from his mouth so the fans could learn, authoritatively and from the middle, exactly how Pakistan had perfected their series-winning delivery. The law break! Now he's been fined a record \\u00a37,800 for telling the truth \\u2014 \\u00a35,000 and \\u00a31,000 costs yesterday, in addition to an earlier \\u00a31,800 by Northants. Nit-picking legalists \\u2014 and how that tribunal looked loaded with them \\u2014 will say the two fines for one offence are not because Lamb exposed Pakistan. They will say Lamb is being roasted for breach of contract. Maybe there are some people gullible enough to believe that. But you won't find Daily Mirror readers among their ranks. We know, don't we, that Lamb hasn't been fined so heavily for breaching a harsh contract. He has been fined for exposing a wrong that England and Pakistan seemed happier keeping under the carpet. And I'll think better of cricket only if the Daily Mirror's cheque for \\u00a35,000 goes to charity. SIR COLIN: Stonewalling Rambo ready Charles Fawcus RAMBO'S HALL rolled back the years yesterday and now he's spot on for another Cambridgeshire bid. Trainer Jeremy Glover landed his biggest win when Rambo's Hall took the 1989 cavalry charge at Newmarket and his confidence is sky high again. \\u2018Everything we've planned with this horse has come off. We set out to win that Cambridgeshire and we set out to win the two races at Haydock which came before today,\\u2019 he smiled. \\u2018But the horse has certainly had a few adventures in the meantime. We sold him for \\u00a3100,000 to race in America and bought him back for \\u00a325,000 when he did nothing over there. \\u2018Then he got injured in a field and had to be off for a year, but everything seems to be going well now. Newmarket is the next stop and he's not rated much higher than when he won the race before.\\u2019 Corals were so impressed they cut Rambo's Hall to 7-1 joint favourite with the horse Glover rates his biggest threat \\u2014 last year's winner Mellottie. Rambo's Hall provided Jeremy with, his first Ascot win but he's hopeful of doubling that with Doulab's Image tomorrow \\u2014\\u2018He'll love the softer ground.\\u2019 Ascot's Cesarewitch trial didn't provide many clues for Newmarket, but it did cause top jockeys Pat Eddery and Michael Roberts some anxious moments. They were pulled into the stewards room after the race as officials took a long look at an incident early in the straight.A ban would have ruled the pair out of the Cambridgeshire and the Arc, but no action was taken. Roberts won the race on Bold Resolution, who is not entered for Newmarket, but last year's shock Ces winner Go South didn't run badly in fourth. Luca Comani mopped up the Blue Seal Stakes for the sixth time in seven years with promising newcomer Queen's View. GLOUCESTER trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies took six horses up to Perth, and five of them have won \\u2014 including four out of four yesterday. Emily's Star, Sweet Duke, Grange Blake, and Petosku combined to reward Twiston-Davies\\u2019 new Scottish fan club with a handsome 454-1 accumulator. Celtic Prince had won the day before, and only Twist 'N' Scu (eighth in a bumper) failed to do the business  SURREY CHEATS FINED \\u00a31,000 Cricket's rocked by another ball-tampering scandal 3-year saga of shame COLIN PRICE WAQAR YOUNIS'S county Surrey have been fined \\u00a31,000 for repeated ball-tampering over a three-year period. The Test and County Cricket Board acted only hours after fining Allan Lamb five times as much for exposing Pakistan as ball-gouging cheats. Spokesman Ken Lawrence said: \\u2018We are determined to stamp out what little ball-tampering there is in the domestic game.\\u2019 A four-man panel imposed the heaviest fine in their power \\u2014 but it will only be paid if Surrey's bowlers are involved in another incident within two years. The flash-point that finally forced Lord's to act came last month while Waqar was away on tour with Pakistan. But the world's most devastating fast bowler played in two other matches when umpires reported Surrey to Lord's under Law 42.5 which exclusively governs unfair play. Struggle He destroyed Yorkshire's second innings at Guildford with six for 40 last year but struggled to break through against Gloucestershire in a drawn match at Cheltenham in 1990. Last night Surrey skipper Alec Stewart, the England vice-captain, who appeared before the tribunal, said: \\u2018I have absolutely no comment to make, on the instructions of Surrey.\\u2019 Lord's secretly warned Surrey in writing at the end of the 1991 season. But they ran into trouble again during a 72-run defeat by Leicestershire at The Oval last month. Umpires Barry Dudleston and John Holder \\u2014 the man who reported England for tampering with the ball on the same ground against West Indies last year \\u2014 changed the ball because it had been suspiciously scuffed. Stewart, Surrey coach Geoff Arnold and secretary David Seward were all summoned to Lord's for a disciplinary hearing. Donald Carr, chairman of the panel, said: \\u2018Surrey were given a warning last year for repeated offences and that is why the matter was reported to the disciplinary committee.\\u2019 Lawrence added: \\u2018It must be stressed that we do not see ball-tampering in our domestic game as a serious problem, but we are determined to stamp it out. Message \\u2018There is nothing that cannot be coped with by the co-operation of captains and the vigilance of the umpires. \\u2018I am quite sure that the message has gone home to the counties and their bowlers. \\u2018And after all the controversy involving Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis this summer, Lancashire and Surrey will be well aware that people are going to be looking at their performances. \\u2018But I can assure them our umpires will be quite even-handed about checking all bowlers.\\u2019 Surrey's problems started during the 1990 drawn game at Cheltenham when umpires Chris Balderstone and Barrie Leadbeater changed the ball because it had been tampered with. During the Guildford Festival week in 1991 umpires Don Oslear and Bob White considered the ball had once again been tampered with. But they didn't change it because the only one of similar age available to them had been used in the previous match when Waqar took seven for 87 against Gloucestershire. And the umpires considered that to be in \\u2018too poor a condition\\u2019 to use. One leading umpire told me: \\u2018At last it seems the Board are ready to back up the umpires in this matter.\\u2019 Deal Waqar recently signed a three-year deal to stay at Surrey, estimated to be worth around \\u00a350,000 a year with bonuses. His Pakistan team-mate, paceman Wasim Akram, re-signed for Lancashire in a five-year deal worth around \\u00a3250,000. Both have vigorously denied tampering with the ball. STEWART: Skipper OSLEAR: Umpire LENNOX RAISES ALARM Lewis ready to cash in IAN GIBB LENNOX LEWIS has got a \\u00a3250,000 sponsorship deal to boost his hopes of destroying Razor Ruddock. Anti-car-theft company Nightstick believe they will help steer Lewis through his world heavyweight final eliminator at London's Earls Court on October 31 \\u2014 and help make the \\u00a34m battle a sell-out. Lewis's manager Frank Maloney claims that 5,000 tickets have already gone with 7,000 still to be shifted. And the fighter revealed he's shelling out \\u00a320,000 for sparring partners Mike Weaver and Tony Tubbs, both former world champions. Lennox also hit back at critics, who claim he should have avoided the dangerous Ruddock and hidden himself away for a world title shot, snapping: \\u2018I know the British fight fans will respect me for going in against the best instead of facing an easy touch. \\u2018That's what Riddick Bowe did by beating Pierre Coetzer and now Frank Bruno is getting all brave by daring to face Coetzer.\\u2019 Meanwhile, Herol Graham is contemplating quitting after his shock British middleweight title defeat by Bradford's Frank Grant. The Sheffield Bomber said: \\u2018I'll have to have a long, serious think about my future \\u2014 but I'll make the decision, on my own. And it will be final.\\u2019 BBC commentator Harry Carpenter was under fire last night after he said Fidel Castro Smith had in fact beaten victor Henry Wharton in their Commonwealth super-middleweight showdown \\u2014 a decision that also had Bruno up in arms. But  promoter Mickey Duff said: \\u2018If we're talking retirement it should be 5 to 4 ON Carpenter going before Graham!\\u2019 LEWIS: Cash boost BOT BACK MARTIN RICHARDS WIGAN'S top points scorer Frano Botica returns after injury for tonight's big TV clash with Widnes. And Test winger Martin Offiah will also be back after a two-match absence if he comes through a fitness test on his damaged hamstring this morning. Botica is at stand-off with Shaun Edwards continuing at scrum-half. Widnes have big injury problems with Jonathan Davies, John Devereux, Tony Myler and Richard Eyres all rated very doubtful. But Bobby Goulding is back at scrum-half after a two-match suspension. Wigan will meet Oldham in the semi-finals of the Greenalls Lancashire Cup if they beat Swinton in the second round next Tuesday. In the second semi-final Salford travel to the winners of next Wednesday's tie between holders St Helens and Widnes. Wallace in from the cold Fergie's U-turn KEN LAWRENCE DANNY WALLACE has ended his Old Trafford nightmare and is poised to prove it against Queen's Park Rangers tomorrow. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson revealed last night he is so impressed by Wallace's comeback that he is considering making room for him in his team's title push. Wallace scored a wonder goal in the Coca Cola Cup clash at Brighton this week \\u2014 his first strike for the club since December 15, 1990. Wallace, signed for \\u00a31.2million from Southampton, last played a League game in May 1991 and until the last fortnight it seemed his future lay away from Manchester. But he returned to the side in last week's UEFA Cup match with Torpedo Moscow and his performance against Brighton finally convinced Fergie that the little winger still has a part to play. Wallace was only being used at Brighton because Fergie wanted to give his regular stars a rest. But the days of Wallace being only a bit part player are coming to an end. Ferguson revealed: \\u2018I have been so impressed by Danny's form that I am now giving serious consideration about playing him in the League team. I haven't made up my mind just yet, indeed, I don't quite know what to do. \\u2018But Danny has shown through his attitude and his skill that he deserves to be in the side and he is under serious consideration for inclusion against QPR. \\u2018I was ready to take \\u00a3600,000 for Danny during the summer but no one came in for him. \\u2018Thank goodness for that, he would have been the sale of the century.\\u2019 Wallace's attempts to establish himself at United have been hindered by the player's desperation to become a Stretford End hero as Fergie explained: \\u2018He tried too hard to make himself popular. \\u2018He should have realised he had nothing to prove and now, thankfully, he does. \\u2018He has finally come to terms with being a United player.\\u2019 WALLACE could return to United's League starting line-up for the first time in 16 months. Ticked off BERNIE LOVETT THE guilty clubs in the FA Cup ticket probe were named yesterday by trading standards officers. The officers estimate touts made at least \\u00a3138,000 profit from fans at Wembley for the Liverpool-Sunderland final, with an average mark-up of \\u00a3115 per ticket. One Scottish-based supporter paid \\u00a3750 for two \\u00a345 tickets, originally allocated to Brighton. Liverpool chief trading standards officer Peter Mawdsley said: \\u2018A fundamental change is still needed in the allocation system to give the finalists substantially more tickets.\\u2019 The clubs named are: Southampton, Newcastle, Luton, Tottenham, Bristol Rovers, Barnet, Brighton, Liverpool and Sunderland. But Liverpool were congratulated for their efforts to minimise touting from their 26,000 allocation. Fox in a hole NEATH have promised to back Welsh star Kevin Fox after the 23-year-old forward was yesterday revealed to have failed a drugs test. Flanker Fox tested positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine following Neath's opening league game against Pontypridd on September 5. The Wales Under- 19 cap seems certain to receive a minimum three-month ban when he goes before the Welsh Rugby Union next month. But Neath are backing the player's insistence that he merely took a cold remedy. BLANKED HUGH JAMIESON STRUGGLING Nottingham Forest yesterday lost out in the chase for Napoli sweeper Laurent Blanc. Blanc, 27, the French star wanted by Forest boss Brian Clough, has decided to join Nimes in his home country. And while Clough misses out again, it is understood that Blanc has a contract that will take him to French drama club Marseille in the summer. Clough has been left kicking his heels in his search to replace England defender Des Walker, who left on a \\u00a31.5 million cut-price deal to Italian giants Sampdoria in the summer. And as Forest, with just one point from seven League games, prepare for tomorrow's trip to Chelsea, they have extended striker Gary Bannister's loan to a third month. Derby last night signed former Ajax midfielder Richard Goulooze for \\u00a3100,000 from Dutch Second Division side Heerenveen. Spink stays ASTON VILLA are set to offer a new contract to goalkeeper Nigel Spink \\u2014 six months after he thought his career at the club might be over. Spink, who has been first choice since regaining the No 1 spot from Les Sealey in March, said: \\u2018There was a time when my future seemed in jeopardy but things have turned my way again.\\u2019 THE VOICE OF DAILY MIRROR SPORT MIKE LANGLEY From bad to nurse FOREST directors wouldn't be human if they didn't relish Brian Clough stewing in his own juice. He once called them \\u2018a shower\\u2019. He seized several chances to disparage board members. He's also said: \\u2018I've never been in love with directors. A certain percentage are nobodies who want to become somebodies on my back.\\u2019 Now bottom of the table, Brian is in their power, even though chairman Fred Reacher swears: \\u2018He's always had our full backing and there is no danger of that changing.\\u2019 So I liken Forest policy to this rhyme: \\u2018Always keep tight hold of nurse for fear of getting someone worse.\\u2019 CLOUGH: Backing BLOW THEM ALL TO BITS CAN'T we have a bit of a rest from \\u2018bit?\\u2019 It's become the most overworked and useless word in commentary. Bit of a player, bit of a knock, bit of confusion, bit of dissent, bit of a chance, bit of indecision. Bits to the bitter end! I remember the days when bit meant a bird, but not the sort you'd find in the same cage as the sick parrot. DURIE KO NEIL SILVER TOTTENHAM striker Gordon Durie will be out of action for two weeks after being rushed to hospital last night for an operation on his left knee. It also means that the Scottish international's disciplinary hearing due to take place at the Football Association this afternoon has been called off. Durie was scheduled to fight an FA charge of misconduct after referee Dermot Gallagher alleged he feigned being head-butted in a confrontation with Andy Pearce in a game against Coventry on August 18. He was booked by Gallagher for ungentlemanly conduct after falling to the ground as he squared up to Pearce. Durie was rushed into hospital for the operation within hours of the Tottenham party \\u2014 minus Durie \\u2014 returning from Wednesday night's friendly against Lazio in Rome. Bruce earns recall CLOWN prince goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar returns to the Liverpool side against Wimbledon tomorrow as manager Graeme Souness tries to stop the rot at Anfield. Grobbelaar's recall means David James will be axed as he falls victim to Liverpool's worst start to a season for 39 years. But Souness last night stressed that James is not being made a scapegoat for Liverpool's disastrous start, nor for the eight goals they have conceded in the last two games. Souness said: \\u2018Bruce will play because I feel the time is right. \\u2018I feel there is a need for experience in all positions and I'm not blaming James for anything other than the first goal against Chesterfield. \\u2018I've explained it to him and it's not fair on him being exposed to some of our defending in recent weeks.\\u2019 Andy move DURHAM have signed West Indian paceman Anderson Cummins as their overseas player for next season. Cummins, 26, who has played in 16 one-day internationals but has yet to make his Test debut, has been offered a one-year contract. He will replace Dean Jones, who is set to tour England with the Australians next season. Cummins was the West Indies' leading wicket-taker in the World Cup and he has been selected for their squad to tour Australia this winter. IRON MAN MATT HUGHES IAN IRONSIDE'S reward for his defiant display for Middlesbrough against Newcastle is a first team call-up tomorrow against Aston Villa. Boro boss Lennie Lawrence said: \\u2018The lad has arrived as a Premier League goalkeeper.\\u2019 Ironside, 28, grabbed his chance because of an injury to Steve Pears and Millwall wouldn't release on-loan Brian Horne to play in Wednesday night's goalless cup-tie. Ironside, who produced a string of spectacular saves, said: \\u2018That's the best performance I've put up in front of the television cameras and such a big crowd.\\u2019 John Byrne returns from a two-week lay-off for Sunderland \\u2014 who have scored only three League goals this season \\u2014 at home to Bristol Rovers. And Byrne had a message of hope for boss Malcolm Crosby: \\u2018I'm not worried.\\u2018 KING JACK MARTIN RICHARDS AUSSIE veteran Gary Jack is the still the king of full-backs, says Sheffield Eagles boss Gary Hetherington. The 31-year-old former Balmain star rolled back the years on Wednesday night with a scintillating display against Bradford Northern to help lift the Eagles into the Yorkshire Cup semi-finals for the first time. \\u2018If there's a better full- back in the world at the moment I want see him said Hetherington.\\u2019 Jack's magnificent start with the Eagles could win him a dramatic recall for Australia in next month's World Cup final against Great Britain. d Draw for the Yorkshire Cup semi-finals: Sheffield Eagles v Hull; Featherstone v Wakefield (October 7). Puffed ENGLAND boss Graham Taylor has admitted for the first time that his team flopped in the European Championship finals because they weren't fit enough. Taylor said: \\u2018We have to face up to the fact that we're falling behind other countries who do things regarding fitness as a matter of course.\\u2019 Can can ERIC Cantona last night threw Leeds a European Cup lifeline by declaring that he could be fit for the second leg against Stuttgart at Elland Road next week. The French goal ace had feared being out of the game for two months after hobbling out of the 3-0 first leg defeat with a damaged hamstring. Al's in SHEFFIELD United keeper Simon Tracey was last night ruled out for a fortnight as understudy Alan Kelly mounted a takeover bid. Kelly was due to step down after covering for the suspended Tracey against Arsenal last week. But Tracey is likely to miss three more games with a shoulder injury. YOU MUST BE MAD! Come on Graham, this is no time to ditch our best hope Give Paul a go NIGEL CLARKE GRAHAM TAYLOR needs Paul Gascoigne now more than at any time in his two-year reign as international manager. And he must be mad to want to shunt him into the sidings before throwing him an England shirt again. Not to risk Gazza until the World Cup-tie against San Marino in February, shows Taylor does not yet understand just what the \\u00a35.5million star can do for English football. I know Gazza is not yet fully fit. But England need his creativity, his inspiration, and, most of all, his sheer blinding brilliance. Of course it would be a gamble to throw him back in so early, but it is a gamble that has worked before. Tottenham played Gazza in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, in 1991, one incredible month after a double hernia operation. He scored the first goal that put Spurs in the final, inspired them to victory, then went off after 60 minutes\\u2026job done. Confidence Gazza could do the same for his country if Taylor was prepared to take the risk. But he isn't \\u2014 and how England need the kind of driving confidence that sent Spurs into battle against the doomed Gunners. Gascoigne went up to each player in the dressing-room before the kick-off, roughly shook him, and demanded he die for the club and the cause. Taylor says he does not want to get involved in emotional situations \\u2014 but football is about emotion, and it disappoints me that Taylor does not want to show his. Gazza should now be encouraged, not discouraged, and then disillusioned to find out that he is to be overlooked until next February. Give Gazza belief, and he'll hand over his heart and soul. England's most endearing footballer badly wants to belong again, and I still believe a half-fit Gascoigne would offer Taylor more in mid-field than has been dished up lately. Does the England manager need to be reminded how sterile England were against Spain? How we were outplayed by Brazil, Hungary and Czechoslovakia? And what happened in all three games of the European Championship? Isn't it worth giving Gazza a game to find out just what he can do \\u2014 just what he is capable of producing? I believe it would be far in excess of anything England have laid before the public. The Norwegians won't be easy at Wembley. They are strongest where England are weakest \\u2014 in midfield. They will come with six World Cup points already in the bag. Before they sensationally beat Holland on Wednesday night, they had already stuck ten goals past the no-hopers of San Marino. And in two weeks\\u2019 time, just before their Wembley date, they play San Marino again, so they will be World Cup Group Two leaders with three victories before England have even begun their campaign. Another defeat, or even a draw for Taylor, will leave him with so much work to do to close the gap. Taylor has been guilty before of overlooking the impact Gazza can have on a game. He left him out of the match against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin two years ago. It was a decision that left one Irish player saying: \\u2018Can we have him for just 20 minutes? That would be long enough.\\u2019 Taylor needs Gascoigne, England need him too. I believe Taylor is misreading the situation yet again by delaying his comeback. He is a great player, a mood player, and more use to his country for 20 minutes than most are for 90. Lazio are happy with his fitness \\u2014 so go on Graham\\u2026 I dare you. Pick him, and play him. Give him the first half, and see what he would do. You love England, you above all want us to be successful. Not every decision can be pre-planned to the last detail \\u2014 we know you are good at that. But now perhaps it's time, just for once, to let your heart rule your head. Gazza won't let you down. SPANISH HOLIDAY GRAHAM TAYLOR took Gazza to Spain two weeks ago \\u2018just for the trip\\u2019\\u2014 but now the Lazio star is fit he still won't figure in the England starting line-up. Ellery's hope ELLERY Hanley hopes to make his Leeds comeback in Sunday's clash with Bradford Northern after missing two games with hamstring trouble. GAZZA IS OUT Graham Taylor's amazing verdict No way he can face Norway NIGEL CLARKE GRAHAM TAYLOR yesterday admitted he won't give Paul Gascoigne his international return against Norway next month. Instead the England manager will keep his jewel in the crown under wraps for another five months. So England must do without Gazza in the vital World Cup qualifying match at Wembley on October 14, and also against Turkey on November 18. But Gascoigne last night pleaded for the chance to come to the rescue of his country against Norway. Gazza will make his debut in Italian soccer for his new team Lazio within the next eight days, and is raring to go for club and country. Taylor, after the abysmal European championship, again flopped in Spain and cannot afford to foul up against Norway, who beat Holland 2-1 on the night Gazza made his comeback against Spurs. Boost Gazza said yesterday: \\u2018Hopefully I will be ready for England. I want to be in perfect condition for the match against Norway and I think I will. \\u2018I was pleased that Lawrie McMenemy watched me and said good things about me, that's another boost. \\u2018I shall have to wait and see what the situation is with Lazio before I know about England. \\u2018If I am invited I shall be delighted to go with them and then I will see if I play or not. \\u2018I'm happy with my fitness. There's been no reaction to my match and I was pleased with my performance. \\u2018I've not played for a long time and to get a goal in the first ten minutes was incredible. Even though it was billed as a friendly, Tottenham didn't treat it that way.\\u2019 But England boss Taylor said: \\u2018I want to bring him back when the time is right. If we are sensible it ought to be against San Marino in February.\\u2019 Gazza will be in the squad to face Norway, but Taylor goes on: \\u2018I would like him to be involved, just as he was in Spain.\\u2019 Then the Geordie star travelled to Santander and trained with the team but watched England's defeat from a touchline seat. Taylor believes he must protect Gascoigne just at a time when he seems to have shaken off the horrific knee injury that has kept him out of football for 17 months. And he says: \\u2018I think it is my job and my duty to protect that talent. Bring any player back and he does not perform and people have short memories. They will have a go at him. \\u2018If I felt there was a part that he could play and he felt he could play it \\u2014 and if it was reasonable to ask him \\u2014 I would bear that in mind. \\u2018But I believe it would be unfair on him after being out for so long to go straight back in and do a job. \\u2018People say play a half-fit Gazza, or give him a game for just a quarter of a match. But that is an emotional statement, and I must make sure I don't get carried away by emotional things like that. \\u2018How can we just throw in a lad who has not played for so long? We qualified for the European championship without him, so we don't have to take risks.\\u2019 Gascoigne marked his first match for Lazio against Spurs by scoring after ten minutes against his old team-mates. He badly wants to play, and believes that once he has a League match with Lazio under his belt he will be ready to give his heart to England. Club boss Dino Zoff said he would decide whether Gazza plays on Sunday an hour or two before the game. Taylor said: \\u2018I shall not be going to Italy to see him again. Lawrie McMenemy was in Rome and I shall be talking to him about it.\\u2019 McMENEMY: Impressed I'M THE BOSS GRAHAM Taylor is prepared to make his tough decision Splash out on the sea CHARLES FAWCUS ALL AT SEA has the name and the conditions to cause a big splash at Ascot today. All the rain she needs has fallen on the Queen's racetrack in the past week to make jockey Pat Eddery set for a much better day than last year. Then the Champion got banned for his ride on Midnight Air who was thrown out of first place after the Fillies Mile. \\u2018That was a bad day, but I'm hopeful of a lot better luck on All At Sea. She is a different filly when the going is in her favour and everything was just right when she beat Brief Truce in France.\\u2019 All At Sea has run well against the best when things were against her as well\\u2014 second to User Friendly in the Oaks, second to Ruby Tiger at Goodwood and second to Rodrigo De Triano at York. Last year's winner Selkirk has to be a big threat again following his fine Goodwood win. \\u2018It never stopped raining all that day so he won't mind the ground,\\u2019 said Ian Balding. But Geoff Wragg, trainer of Marling who beat Selkirk in the Sussex Stakes, is much more concerned. \\u2018I'll walk the course before racing, but we don't want much more rain,\\u2019 he said. Marling was an unlucky second to Hatoof in the I, 000 Guineas and Hatoof ran third behind All At Sea at Longchamp last time. Another soft ground specialist, Green Lane, looks set for his fourth win in a row in the Krug Trophy. His trainer Roger Charlton trains a smart youngster in Inchinor who kept up his unbeaten record at Ascot yesterday. HOPEFUL\\u2026 Pat Eddery UNBEATEN French juvenile Zieten is poised to join the line-up for the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket on Thursday. Andre Fabre's colt was supplemented yesterday for the Group One contest over six furlongs. Owner Sheikh Mohammed won the race with the Fabre-trained Lycius two years ago and last year Lion Cavern finished runner-up to Rodrigo de Triano. PUT UP OR SHUT UP! Eastwood in barney over title showdown Hoko ready for business IAN GIBB THE featherweight domestic dream fight is on after a \\u2018put-up or shut-up\\u2019 challenge from Barney Eastwood to Frank Warren. Eastwood, manager of Kirkby's WBC world champion Paul Hodkinson, is ready to talk business with Warren, promoter of WBO champ Colin McMillan of Barking. Eastwood moved yesterday on Warren's latest \\u00a3425,000 offer, with each fighter getting \\u00a3200,000 and a \\u00a325,000 bonus for the winner. Faxed Belfast fight boss Eastwood revealed: \\u2018It's all systems go \\u2014 I have faxed Frank Warren to say that Paul Hodkinson is prepared to fight Colin McMillan in November. \\u2018I have asked Warren to lodge \\u00a350,000, non-returnable, with the British Boxing Board of Control by close of business next Tuesday if he is serious about promoting the fight. \\u2018If and when that is done we can sit down and talk about getting the fight on. \\u2018This would undoubtedly be a great domestic fight.\\u2019 It all gives added importance to McMillan's WBO title defence tonight at London's Olympia against Colombian Ruben Dario Palacio, and Hoko is travelling down from Liverpool to watch. There will be some red tape to cut through as Hodkinson is due to defend the WBC title against mandatory number one challenger Kevin Kelley of the USA. But Eastwood said: \\u2018I am sure we can come to an arrangement whereby Kelley steps aside for a while. \\u2018Also, the WBC don't have McMillan in their current top ten, so something would have to be done there. \\u2018The WBC are not interested in a unification fight with the WBO but I don't see any problems as it can be a simple defence of Paul's WBC title.\\u2019 Eastwood was concerned that no one should think Hodkinson was dodging McMillan. \\u2018For people to say we were scared is nonsense,\\u2019 he said. Impressive Warren responded yesterday by saying: \\u2018As soon as I have received official notice from Eastwood we will do what is necessary to get the fight on. It sounds like good news.\\u2019 First of all, McMillan must deal with tough-nut Palacio, and do an impressive job to launch the Hoko clash. It shouldn't be beyond Britain's most brilliant stylist, who hand-picked Palacio from the WBO's top ten. The 30-year-old Palacio used to fight for coins in the streets of Medellin and was good enough to fight for the WBA super-bantamweight crown two years ago, when he claimed he was robbed. Fellow countryman Luis Mendoza got away with a draw \\u2014 but in the return Palacio was halted in the third round. Since then it's been almost all downhill with another four defeats in his next five fights, three inside the distance. Palacio has won the last two, but I doubt whether he has much ambition left to extend McMillan past the eighth round. Colin resents the notion that he doesn't carry a big punch and this could be a chance for him to try to prove otherwise as Palacio admits to having been knocked out four times in his 58-fight career. Sheffield's Fidel Castro Smith has been given a reward for going so close to beating Henry Wharton in their exciting super-middleweight fight at Leeds United's Elland Road this week. Loser Smith and virtually the whole TV audience thought he should have retained his British title and taken Wharton's crown, but was adjudged the loser by half a point. Wharton's manager Mickey Duff declined the chance to fight Italian Vicenzo Nardiello for the vacant European title, so Smith has jumped in to take his chance. COLIN McMILLAN (left) squares up to tonight's opponent Ruben Palacio, whom Mac must deal with before he worries about Paul Hodkinson HODKINSON: Crunch EASTWOOD: Move Catch us if you can says Mike HUGH JAMIESON NORWICH manager Mike Walker doesn't believe his team can win the Premier League \\u2014 but last night he vowed the Canaries would fight beak and claw to stay top. Norwich go to second-placed Coventry today in a surprise top of the table clash and Walker said: \\u2018We are in front and it's up to us stay there. \\u2018As I've said before, it's not really realistic to expect us to win the league but the others have to try to catch us first. \\u2018If we can stay at or near the top until Christmas, then our chances get even better and we can certainly expect to finish in the top six at least. \\u2018It gives me a lot of pleasure to be top but the fact that everybody is surprised is disappointing.\\u2019 Meanwhile Coventry boss Bobby Gould has used a touch of \\u2018pure genius\\u2019 to prepare his players for the match. With the Sky Blues aiming to overtake Norwich, Gould took his team out for pint or two of Guinness! He joked: \\u2018It was for medicinal purposes, you understand. \\u2018We had just played two games in three days, so I had the players in for a hot bath and a massage before taking them for a couple of pints of Guinness. \\u2018The locals were gobsmacked when us lot trooped in!\\u2019 Like Walker, Gould is adamant that his team's form isn't just a flash in the pan. \\u2018I know what a lot of people are thinking. They sneer and think it won't last,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Well, we've already had TV exposure and it's created a lot of confidence here. \\u2018We've also earned respect from fellow professionals \\u2014 just like Norwich \\u2014 and it's good to see it happening.\\u2019 WALKER: Fighter Scarlet fever! LLANELLI will become the first Welsh club to earn match receipts of \\u00a3100,000 when the Heineken League leaders take on champions Swansea today. The Scarlets are expecting a capacity 14,500 crowd to bring in around \\u00a370,000. Television income and match sponsorship will add at least a further \\u00a330,000 to the day's takings. Coventry draw on a touch of genius HUGH JAMIESON COVENTRY manager Bobby Gould used a touch of \\u2018pure genius\\u2019 to prepare his players for today's top-of-the-table clash with Norwich. With the Sky Blues set to overtake the Canaries if they win at Highfield Road, Gould took his team down to the local for pint of two of Guinness! He joked: \\u2018It was for medicinal purposes, you understand. We had just played two games in three days, so I had the players in for a hot bath and a massage before taking them for a couple of pints of Guinness. \\u2018I don't know what the landlord thought, but the locals were gobsmacked when us lot trooped in!\\u2019 Gould is obviously delighted by his team's form and convinced it's no flash in the pan. \\u2018I know what a lot of people are thinking. They sneer and think it won't last,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Well, we've already had TV exposure and it's created a lot of confidence here. \\u2018We've also earned respect from fellow professionals \\u2014 just like Norwich \\u2014 and it's good to see it happening.\\u2019 Stan's threat BARNET chairman Stan Flashman has vowed he will ban any fans caught criticising him on the terraces. In an astonishing outburst on the Barnet Clubcall line, Flashman said: \\u2018I was surprised at the stupidity of people having a go at me. I can tell them they will never, ever return to Barnet while I am chairman if they are captured.\\u2019 Ray puts Rangers on Red alert FRANK WIECHULA RAY WILKINS knows old club Manchester United will be all out for revenge today after Queens Park Rangers effectively cost them the title last year. Rangers' stunning 4-1 upset win at Old Trafford on New Year's Day was a demoralising set-back, and Alex Ferguson's championship hopes eventually bit the dust. Now Rangers face the backlash in a top-five clash at Old Trafford today, with evergreen skipper Wilkins, 36, saying: \\u2018I thought they'd have bounced back after that defeat. \\u2018But United didn't, and looking back it was just the start of their slide. \\u2018I've been in that sort of situation before, sitting in a dressing- room after losing to a team you've been expected to beat. \\u2018It's not a nice feeling and I know what United's war cry will be: \\u2018Let's give them what they gave to us\\u2019.\\u2019 After an awkward start United have shown title form to move into fourth spot, headed by surprise sides Norwich, Coventry and Blackburn. But Wilkins believes their success has been merited: \\u2018The League table is not upside down. The teams up there at the top are there on merit. \\u2018Now it's up to the so-called bigger clubs to make their move,\\u2019 he said. Injury-hit Rangers could have debutant England right-back David Bardsley back after a three-match absence with an ankle injury. He faces a late fitness test, as does left-back Clive Wilson (leg), midfielder Simon Barker (groin) and striker Gary Penrice (knee). But key central defender Alan McDonald is out after being released from hospital with bruised kidneys. WILKINS: Big test LAKE LUCK KEN LAWRENCE PAUL LAKE'S girl-friend has flown to America to be with the Manchester City star thanks to a Maine Road whip-round. The City players collected almost \\u00a31,000 to enable Lisa Johnson to join Lake in Los Angeles where he is recovering from a transplant operation on his knee. Lake flew to the States last week for an operation he hopes will save his career and underwent the same surgery as John Salako of QPR and Ian Durrant of Rangers. And Lake's recovery will be boosted by the arrival of Lisa, who has booked into an hotel close to the Los Angeles clinic where Lake is recovering. City manager Peter Reid said: \\u2018The idea came from the players and I think it's a magnificent gesture. \\u2018Even the youngsters insisted on putting what they could afford into the kitty.\\u2019 DON'T WORRY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE United ace reveals his ordeal over brain illness fear That's what Lee was told by the doctor KEN LAWRENCE LEE SHARPE last night relived the anguish of discovering he had a disease which he feared could not only end his career \\u2014 but kill him. The Manchester United star was diagnosed as having meningitis and is only now starting to battle back to full fitness after having the fright of his young life. Sharpe was suffering from viral meningitis, less dangerous than the full-blown illness. And his recovery will prove to all sufferers that the disease can be cured. But, speaking about his shattering experience for the first time, the England winger admits he feared the worst. Sharpe, now hoping to put his nightmare behind him, told how he froze when doctors gave him their devastating diagnosis. \\u2018Every time you hear about meningitis you think about the brain and that you have a big problem,\\u2019 said Sharpe. \\u2018When I heard the verdict from the doctors it was a case of panic. I thought \\u2018People die from that!\\u2019\\u2019 Specialists are still not sure how Sharpe contracted the disease, but the United star believes there is a connection between his illness and a summer holiday in Greece. He said: \\u2018I went to the island of Kos with some mates and at the same time as I was being ill some of my mates were having headaches and feeling ill. \\u2018I just seemed to get the worst of it.\\u2019 Sharpe's problems began after only two days of pre-season training last July. He takes up the story: \\u2018I got home and had the sensation of pins and needles up my left side which affected my face, tongue, leg and arm. \\u2018I felt partly paralysed.  Everything felt numb. \\u2018The sensation lasted 15-20 minutes and came through my body like a wave. \\u2018I thought it was food poisoning because I had prepared fish which I had not cooked properly and when the doctor arrived he thought the same way. \\u2018Next morning I felt just as bad. I could not keep food or fluids down and when the symptoms did not go after a couple of days they took me to the hospital and put me on a drip.\\u2019 Sharpe was released a few days later, but there were to be many more visits to the hospital as worries grew about his condition. \\u2018On the Saturday I got the pins and needles back and was rushed to casualty. There I was, back on a drip, and wondering what was happening to me. \\u2018Then they gave me a lumbar puncture and discovered the problem. \\u2018The news was scary but the doctor was really good. He advised me that normal meningitis, the kind that affects young kids, is much worse. \\u2018And he consoled me, saying: \\u2018Don't worry son, you're not going to die.\\u2019\\u2019 Future Not surprisingly, however, Sharpe, who less than two years previously seemed to have a golden future with United and England, was scared stiff. And his problems were only just beginning. \\u2018I was taken to hospital three times. I had four attacks altogether, the most recent only a few weeks ago after I had watched Everton beat us 3-0 at Old Trafford. \\u2018The attacks were very worrying. I thought \\u2018My God, is this every going to go away?\\u2019 \\u2018It was explained to me that I had a mild form which was affecting the part of the brain that triggers migraine, which is why I was having sickness attacks and blinding headaches behind the eyes.\\u2019 Sharpe has now begun training again, going through the routine normally reserved for players following their summer break. And he admitted: \\u2018I know it is going to be a hard slog for me to get back, but after what I have been through I'm not bothered how hard it is going to be. \\u2018It is a tremendous relief for me to be kicking a ball around the old place again. \\u2018Before contracting the illness I had already gone through a nightmare year with injuries. \\u2018One minute I was on top of the world and everything was going right. The next the rug was pulled from under my feet.\\u2019 LEE SHARPE feared the worst when hospital tests showed the young United star had meningitis. FLASHBACK: Sharpe the young player of the year Heat on Martin LOCAL boy Martin Gray hopes to make good for Sunderland today. The 21-year-old Teessider faces Bristol Rovers with a \\u2018Don't freeze before your Roker fans\\u2019 warning from the management. Gary Bennett and Richard Ord are dropped in a reshuffle designed to get goals. WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM \\u2018ELL! LEEDS SKIPPER SAYS THEY'VE BEEN TOO SOFT ON THE OPPOSITION \\u2018We'll have to be mean\\u2019 JOHN EDWARDS LEEDS are ready to put a snarl back on the face of football to give their title defence the kick-start it needs. The faltering champions hadn't won in six matches before their Coca Cola Cup caning of lowly Scunthorpe on Tuesday. But skipper Gary McAllister knows all that must change if Leeds are to add the new Premier League title to the old Barclays crown. And they'll get back on a winning streak by putting the \\u2018Ell back in Elland Road \\u2014 just like it was in the glory days of super manager Don Revie and hard-man skipper Billy Bremner. McAllister spelled out what's needed to start plugging the 11-point gap between themselves and leaders Norwich. Disliked He said: \\u2018We've got to get back to the days when Elland Road was an intimidating place for teams to visit. \\u2018There was a time when everyone hated Leeds. We were disliked because of things that had happened in the past and we didn't need any motivation when we kept hearing that sort of talk. \\u2018Suddenly, it's all changed. People seem to like Leeds a bit more and while that's nice, it's maybe one reason why we've relaxed and taken our foot off the pedal. \\u2018We've got to start being a bit meaner on the pitch and we've got to do it now. \\u2018Arsenal fell so far behind at the start of last season that they couldn't catch us, even though they went 17 matches unbeaten towards the end. \\u2018We can't afford to let that happen, so we must produce results now.\\u2019 Leeds have managed only one clean sheet all season and are desperate to shore up a defence that was the cornerstone of last year's success. McAllister believes it's a collective responsibility. He said: \\u2018We've made a poor start and we have worked out why. \\u2018It's simply that while we've been playing well in possession, we haven't been doing the job when the opposition have had the ball. \\u2018A lot of people have told us we've been playing better than last season but we haven't produced winning football. \\u2018We haven't worked hard enough off the ball. We're not pressing teams and making it difficult for them, which has previously been the basis of our success. \\u2018We're desperate to put that right because we don't want to go down as one-season wonders. \\u2018We don't like the idea of anyone suggesting we won the title by default because Manchester United threw it away.\\u2019 Eric Cantona is in the squad less than a fortnight after suffering a hamstring injury that was expected to keep him out of action for two months. The French striker faces a late fitness test, along with defenders Chris Fairclough and Tony Dorigo. REVIE: Glory BREMNER: Hard HARD CORE: Skipper Gary McAllister believes it's time for Leeds to get tough HEROL FIGHTS ON DEPOSED British middleweight champion Herol Graham is to fight on \\u2014 at super middleweight. He announced his decision yesterday, saying: \\u2018I haven't lost my edge or my appetite for boxing.\\u2019 Graham, 33, was stopped in nine rounds on Wednesday by Bradford's unrated Frank Grant. \\u2018I ran out of fuel through making the weight,\\u2019 he explained. \\u2018I'll start roadwork again next week.\\u2019 GRAHAM PAUL'S WAR CRY Fit for action JOHN EDWARDS PAUL WARHURST is set for a dramatic return to first-team football tomorrow \\u2014 less than a fortnight after it almost killed him. The Sheffield Wednesday defender last night confirmed that he's ready to bounce back in the live TV match with Spurs exactly 12 days after a horror collision. Romp Warhurst crashed into Spora keeper Fernand Felten's outstretched fists a split-second after heading one of Wednesday's eight goals in their UEFA Cup romp against the Luxembourg part-timers. Physio Alan Smith raced on and battled to revive him after the former record buy had blocked his air passage by swallowing his tongue. But Warhurst savoured the prospect of an astonishing return to action tomorrow \\u2014 his 23rd birthday. He said: \\u2018The way I'm feeling at the moment, I'm confident I'll be all right. \\u2018I had a bit of a headache on Wednesday, but I did some running yesterday and training today and I'm in great shape again.\\u2019 But player-boss Trevor Francis wants Warhurst to be certain of his fitness before naming him to face Spurs. WARHURST: Swift recovery from KO FRANCIS: Cautious IPSWICH boss Mick McGiven is ready to give his side a roasting before today's Premier League game against Sheffield United at Portman Road. They have been working on their passing and set-piece play after two poor displays in the Premier League and the Coca Cola Cup. McGiven said: \\u2018It's as if subconsciously we switched off after the Wimbledon game and were caught off guard. It's now up to the players to buck their ideas up and bounce back.\\u2019 KEANE STAYS ROY KEANE, Nottingham Forest's reluctant centre half, is under orders to keep the No 5 shirt by manager Brian Clough. Clough, who has not replaced England star Des Walker following his \\u00a31.5 million move to Italian club Sampdoria in the summer, has drafted in 21-year-old midfield man Keane instead. And although Steve Chettle is fit again, Republic of Ireland star Keane stays at centre half for today's trip to Chelsea with Clough insisting: \\u2018I had no option but to play him there. \\u2018It was either Keane or our Nigel. But I thought it would do Roy a power of good to give him a few games at the back as part of his education.\\u2019 PLAY ME JULIAN DICKS is heading for a bust-up with manager Billy Bonds if he's left out again at Portsmouth tomorrow. The Hammers skipper and cult defender missed the midweek Coca-Cola Cup goalless draw with Crewe after completing a three-match ban but insists: \\u2018I won't be happy if I'm left out.\\u2019 Meanwhile, West Ham's first team squad were shown a video of random doping test procedures yesterday. And they have been given a plastic card to carry itemising the major banned drugs. I'LL BE TOUGH ON CLOUGHIE Blues boss threat TONY STENSON CHELSEA won't be making the life of Brian any easier for Cloughie at Stamford Bridge today. Clough, manager of bottom club Nottingham Forest, is under pressure. But Chelsea boss Ian Porterfield, confident after two successive wins, is not feeling sorry for him. \\u2018Just because they have had a slow start, it does not mean they are in trouble,\\u2019 said Porterfield. \\u2018Forest have always been a side who finish better than they start and they will grow stronger again as the season progresses. \\u2018I am in no doubt that we face the stiffest of opposition. \\u2018We've had two good wins away from home and now we want to put on a show for our fans.\\u2019 There will be no place in the Chelsea side for yesterday's signing from Morton, David Hopkins. Future The 21-year-old winger is seen by Porterfield as a player for the future: \\u2018He is big, strong, quick and good with both feet. \\u2018But we have a number of players already challenging for places ahead of him and he will be given time to acclimatise.\\u2019 Right-back Gareth Hall, who missed Chelsea's midweek Coca-Cola Cup win at Walsall, returns to a 16-man squad with goalkeeper Alec Chamberlain also back in line for selection. Chamberlain will start on the bench as Kevin Hitchcock continues to keep Dave Besant in the cold. Chelsea are giving a secret trial to Polish World Cup star Roman Szewczyk. The 27-year-old centre-half has been at Stamford Bridge for the past two days with the hope of making a \\u00a3500,000 move. Szewczyk scored his country's goal against England last season. And the Katowice defender will also be up against Graham Taylor's men in the World Cup qualifying group. Chelsea will decide whether to sign Szewczyk in the next 48 hours as they look for a replacement for injured Paul Elliott. PORTERFIELD: Defiant CLOUGH: Pressure Wally for Oldham SECOND Division leaders Oldham have signed Huddersfield's Aussie full-back Wally Gibson on a month's loan. Gibson, 25, will make his debut in tomorrow's home game against Swinton. He is out of contract and in dispute with Huddersfield, who have recently cut his transfer fee from \\u00a3125,000 to \\u00a355,000. Gunn sale LEEDS hooker Richard Gunn has signed for Featherstone Rovers and goes straight into the side against Carlisle to-morrow. Rovers will also have two other newcomers making their debut \\u2014 Australian scrum-half Brett Daunt and New Zealand prop forward Wayne Taekata from the Sydney club Western Suburbs. Taekata has been highly recommended by Rovers\\u2019 new Aussie coach Steve Martin, and his arrival means Rovers have released another Kiwi forward Clarri Iti. SAVE OUR SOUNESS Clown Prince aims for Anfield smiles as Wimbledon's Crazy Gang lies in wait And Grob's just the man for the job RICHARD TANNER FRANK WIECHULA ANFIELD'S clown prince Bruce Grobbelaar makes a triumphant return to the Kop today in a bid to keep under-siege boss Graeme Souness in a job and put a smile back on Liverpool faces. Souness has axed \\u00a31.3million David James and recalled Grobbelaar to shore up a leaky defence that has conceded 20 goals in 11 League and Cup games this season. Souness believes Grobbelaar's experience is just what his crisis-hit side need as they bid to climb out of the club's worst start since 1953. And Brucie, 35 next month, will relish the chance to return against the team that has caused Liverpool so much grief in recent years. But Wimbledon midfielder Vinny Jones promised last night that the Dons were ready to increase the misery level at Anfield. Jones said: \\u2018There's no reason why we can't add to their downfall. \\u2018We are going to Liverpool at just the right time and there's no reason for them to expect any favours from us.\\u2019 Slump Liverpool's slump was brought into sharp focus by their 4-4 Coca-Cola Cup home draw in midweek against lowly Chesterfield. Jones said: \\u2018Wimbledon have been knocked out of Cups by lower teams. Nobody cried for us, so why should we for Liverpool?\\u2019 Fellow midfielder Lawrie Sanchez, whose goal beat Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final, added: \\u2018Every time we play them, they want to beat us to try to make up for the 1988 defeat. \\u2018But since that match we have progressed, while Liverpool have taken a step back.\\u2019 And boss Joe Kinnear said: \\u2018I've got no sympathy for Liverpool in their current position. As a professional I can't afford to have any. \\u2018We are second from bottom and we need to get a result. I know a win for us will increase the pressure on them but that's football. \\u2018From a personal point of view, I'd like their bad run to continue for another week. \\u2018Graeme Souness is the man to turn it around but he's not been able to pick a settled team because of injuries.\\u2019 The Londoners have won twice and drawn twice on their six League visits to Anfield, as well as having that Cup final to savour. And the Dons will be lining up to test Grobbelaar in the keeper's first senior game since the Charity Shield against Leeds, when his error gave Eric Cantona his hat-trick. Career Grobbelaar, Anfield's No 1 keeper for 11 years, lost his place a week later when he resumed his international career with Zimbabwe rather than play in the opening League game at Nottingham Forest. James, a \\u00a31.3million signing from Watford, looked set for a long run but his mistakes have persuaded Souness to take him out of the spotlight. The manager's hand has been strengthened by the return of striker Steve McManaman, who has recovered from a back injury, and Dane Torben Piechnik, who was on World Cup duty in midweek. Souness said: \\u2018Wimbledon are quite an aggressive side. We know what to expect. \\u2018But I just want the same character and fight we showed when we were 3-0 down to Chesterfield. \\u2018At no time did we throw the towel in. We had some young boys out there who could have gone into their shell, but they didn't and that pleased me.\\u2019 BRUCIE IS BACK! IT looked like the end for Bruce Grobbelaar when he lost his place to \\u00a31.3million summer signing David James. But now the Clown Prince is poised for a sensational return. RED FACED HOW former Anfield hero Emlyn Hughes rated the Liverpool line-up in Tuesday's Mirror Sport. That night, they drew 4-4 with Chesterfield. SORE POINT: Injuries have ruined Souness's plans FRIGHT FOR NIGEL Gutsy Mansell TED MACAULEY WORLD champion Nigel Mansell emerged from a horrifying 150mph spin in Estoril yesterday to gasp: \\u2018That was one of the most frightening moments of my life!\\u2019 Mansell is looking to clinch a record-breaking ninth Grand Prix win in a season \\u2014 and he underlined his determination yesterday by blasting clear of his chasers in the first qualifying session for tomorrow's Portuguese race. But super-cool Mansell had needed all his skill when the Williams car's hydraulic system totally failed, suddenly jamming on the brakes and locking it in gear at 150mph. He swerved off the track and into the gravel trap backwards, praying he wouldn't clout the wall. And he confessed: \\u2018It was a big, big moment. It was very frightening.\\u2019 He also revealed that he and his team boss Frank Williams have cooled their differences. He said: \\u2018We're all professionals. I've got a job to do. I've got three races left \\u2014 three races to win. And I want them all. \\u2018Whatever differences I have with the management have been buried. There are some regrets \\u2014 but not on my side. \\u2018I'm not even sure that my team-mate, Riccardo Patrese, will help me out on Sunday. I think it will be a free-for-all. \\u2018And I'm sure it will be a bloody good race.\\u2019 MANSELL: Spin AGONY OP FOR CHAMP TED MACAULEY NIGEL Mansell will end a year of intense secret agony by having an operation on his driving foot. Although in non-stop pain, he has put off the operation until the Formula One championship season is over. The drama of Mansell's foot injury has been one of racing's best-kept secrets. He has finished most Formula One battles limping heavily, wincing with excruciating pain \\u2014 but bravely trying to hide the seriousness of it from his rivals. But I learned about the problem that has dogged him from race one, and he confirmed to me: \\u2018At the end of the season I'll be having an operation.\\u2019 He will probably have it in America where he has signed with film legend Paul Newman's Indycar team. Critics of the brave Brummie falsely believed that he was overdramatising his gruelling effort in a race with a theatrical limp afterwards. NEWMAN: Boss IT'S PASTA JOKE Mama Mia-such a Roman hollerday GAZZA knows that when in Rome, do as the Romans \\u2014 so he got into the spirit with some impressive hand waving and high passion during a training match. First he threw down his training bib, then he tried to make a point to coaches Dino Zoff and Giancarlo Oddi. And when that didn't work, he had an animated discussion with team manager Maurizio Mancini before stamping off. But it was all as innocent as Gazza himself. He explained: \\u2018I did it because we were beaten 3-1 in the practice match.\\u2019 EXCLUSIVE pictures by ARNOLD SLATER  TAKE THAT: Gazza dumps his training bib as Dino Zoff and Giancarlo Oddi move in C'mon BOSS: Zoff and Oddi look bemused as an animated Gazza tries to make his point COOL IT: Team manager Maurizio Mancini mediates between Gascoigne and Zoff I'M OFF: Mancini and Zoff are left looking resigned as Gazza turns his back on them HATS ZOFF TO GAZZA Big Mac goes batzio over Paul's debut for Lazio England keep the door open HARRY HARRIS ENGLAND No 2 Lawrie McMenemy said last night that it would be a giant step forward for Gazza to make his Lazio debut tomorrow. Graham Taylor's sidekick said: \\u2018He has already achieved the first step by playing in the friendly against Spurs and it will be a very big step to get into a competitive game where there will be no quarter given or asked. \\u2018If Dino Zoff decides to pick him then he must be confident that Gazza can handle it. If Gazza is back in the Lazio team then he has potentially two more fixtures before England's game against Norway and that provides us with an opportunity to take a look at him in competitive football, something he has not played in for nearly two years.\\u2019 McMenemy watched Gazza against his old Spurs team-mates. He gave Taylor a positive report in the small hours of Wednesday night when the England manager returned from Oslo \\u2014 where he watched Norway beat Holland 2-1 \\u2014 and McMenemy returned from Rome. Ordeal McMenemy said: \\u2018The main concern is that there was no reaction to the injury after he played on Wednesday night. And it is also good news to hear that his chances are now better than 50 per cent of playing this weekend.\\u2019 I believe that Taylor is still leaving the door open for Gazza to play some part against Norway in the opening World Cup tie at Wembley on October 14 \\u2014 providing he comes through the ordeal of an Italian League baptism. McMenemy added: \\u2018As I understand it Graham said that in an ideal world the longer the lay-off the more games you would hope a player would have before his next England appearance. \\u2018But we don't always live in the perfect world. \\u2018Games come earlier than we want them to, other times not quickly enough!\\u2019 Taylor may recall that Gazza returned from a double-hernia operation to win a high-tension match for Spurs at Wembley inside the first 15 minutes. Crescendo Gazza beat David Seaman with a 35-yard free kick and set up a goal in a blistering comeback against Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final. Now, after nearly 17 months out since his self-inflicted injury in the FA Cup final against Nottingham Forest, he surpassed expectations by scoring after just ten minutes against Spurs in the Olympic Stadium. Since then the clamour for his Italian League debut has reached a crescendo here in Rome. And McMenemy will be fascinated to discover how Gazza survives against the hatchet men of Italian football. McMENEMY: Offering Gazza an England lifeline COWDREY: MY FEAR COLIN PRICE THE most powerful man in world cricket admitted for the first time last night that he is frightened of being sued over the Lambgate Scandal. ICC chairman Sir Colin Cowdrey (left) is clearly furious that every time he has been ready to make a statement about the Texaco Trophy events of August 23, Pakistan's lawyers have threatened writs. \\u2018I know what I want to say but I am not a millionaire and cannot afford to see my family dragged into that kind of thing,\\u2019 he said. Weeks of legal bickering by Pakistan lawyers have left the International Cricket Council fuming about their inability to take firm action over the damaging saga. The ICC have now asked the MCC law-makers to see if the rules relating to unfair play can be tightened up. But Sir Colin said: \\u2018Law 42.5 is already perfectly clear. It covers the use of illegal substance, lifting the seam and scuffing the leather. If people are going to break laws then we have to prove it.\\u2019 He added: \\u2018All this could be solved by the captains. They are responsible for what goes on but quite clearly some have been turning a blind eye.\\u2019 The MCC should have their review finalised for the ICC meeting in January. But Sir Colin indicated that it could be another two years before the truth is made public. That's when the contractual restrictions are lifted from those involved on that traumatic day when the ball was mysteriously changed at lunch. So far only Allan Lamb has had the courage to speak out \\u2014 and he's been hammered with fines totalling \\u00a37,000, costs of \\u00a31,000 and a two-match ban. Cricket chief's fears  COWDREY: Worried GAZZA IN A FURY The heat is on for \\u00a35.5m star He has a real fling HARRY HARRIS PAUL GASCOIGNE, poised for his Italian League debut for Lazio tomorrow, was furious last night over allegations of a training ground bust-up with his team boss Dino Zoff. Gascoigne threw down his bib after a practice match which his team lost 3-1 and appeared to have angry words with Zoff and assistant coach Giancarlo Oddi before team manager Maurizio Manzini was called in to mediate. But Gazza told reporters afterwards he was just disappointed his team had lost. He then scorched out of the gate, almost crashing his already scratched BMW. Gazza was blazing mad that his training ground \\u2018discussion\\u2019 had been mis-interpreted as a bust-up. Gazza reacted angrily as he explained: \\u2018I've just been told that English journalists are saying that I threw my bib down because Zoff said I was out of the side. If you write that I'll never speak to you again. \\u2018I did it because we were beaten 3-1 in the practice match.\\u2019 Already Gazza has restricted his interviews to twice a week after being hounded by the Italian Press. Zoff, one of the biggest names in Italian football, clarified the whole situation when he said: \\u2018We were just discussing a technical point. It was a general point, we were not arguing. \\u2018In fact, I didn't understand any of it!\\u2019 he joked. Manzini, who acts as interpreter for the England star on the training ground, brushed aside the discussion between Zoff and Gazza as a typical tactical discussion. He said: \\u2018I was called over so Zoff could put some questions to Paul, they were about training and that's all I can say about it.\\u2019 Zoff said yesterday he will make a decision today on whether Gascoigne makes his debut against Genoa. \\u2018I'm optimistic that Gazza will play,\\u2019 said Zoff. \\u2018I'm very happy with him. \\u2018He now has a more than 50 per cent chance of playing.\\u2019 But Zoff knows the knives could be out if Gazza is rushed back into action too quickly. \\u2018If Gascoigne was playing and we lost, all the questioning would start again,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018There's always negative pressure if we lose.\\u2019 HIS BEST BIB AND CHUCKER GAZZA tosses his training bib to the ground yesterday as he confronts Lazio team boss Dino Zoff Sad sale MANCHESTER United legend Bill Foulkes is being forced to sell his trophies to raise cash. Foulkes won practically every honour in the game as a defender in the Busby Babes team. But 60-year-old Bill has hit hard times and said: \\u2018I don't want to sell my memorabilia but at the same time I refuse to sign on the dole \\u2014 I'm too proud for that.\\u2019 ALEC'S POSER MATT HUGHES ENGLAND vice-captain Alec Stewart will be grilled about ball-tampering at his shamed county Surrey. The club were fined \\u00a31,000 by the Test and County Cricket Board for repeated ball-doctoring, and last night they pledged to publish the outcome of their investigations into the affair. And Graham Gooch's first lieutenant Stewart, the Surrey skipper, will be a key witness at a committee of inquiry. The county's chairman Derek Newton said: \\u2018Although it is an internal matter, it is going to be very open and far-reaching. We won't be trying to hide anything. \\u2018I've been left with egg on my face. I feel shocked and embarrassed. I'm pretty sick about it. We don't expect this sort of thing to happen to us.\\u2019 Newton only learnt of the charge on Monday, two days before the county appeared in front of the TCCB. He says he had no idea that Surrey had received two warnings in 1990 and 1991 until the summons arrived from the TCCB citing a third instance, against Leicestershire last month, and referring to the two previous offences. Stewart was in charge on two of the occasions when they were reported by the umpires. Waqar Younis, Surrey's Pakistani paceman, also played in the games but is not expected to have to give evidence at the inquiry. KENNY BLAST ALEC JOHNSON BLACKBURN boss Kenny Dalglish warned the rest of his expensive stars last night they can't always expect \\u00a33.3million striker Alan Shearer to save them with one of his \\u2018specials\\u2019. Cannonball Shearer cracked home a gem to give Blackburn a face-saving 1-1 draw in Wednesday's Coca Cola Cup-tie at Huddersfield. That takes Shearer's tally to 10 goals in 10 games and he is also the Premier League's leading scorer. But on the eve of today's home League clash with free-scoring Oldham Athletic, Dalglish said: \\u2018Yes, that was another great goal from Alan and I was delighted for him. \\u2018But we can't depend upon Alan getting goals like that every week. \\u2018The lads are looking forward to this game against Oldham to put things right. \\u2018Oldham like to attack but then naturally there is a chance they can be caught out at the back so it is up to us to exploit that.\\u2019 But Oldham boss Joe Royle is looking to strikers Graeme Sharp and \\u00a3700,000 ex-Aston Villa man Ian Olney to give Rovers problems. Olney has snapped up just three goals but Royle reckons the partnership is going to prove extremely fruitful. \\u2018Ian is under no pressure from us although his play deserves more goals than that,\\u2019 says Royle. Preki's big day EVERTON'S new Yugoslav star Predrag Radosavljevic makes his Premier League bow at Leeds today insisting: \\u2018I can cope with the physical demands.\\u2019 Boss Howard Kendall took a \\u00a3100,000 gamble last month when he signed the midfielder \\u2014 nicknamed Preki \\u2014 from American club St Louis Storm. And Preki, 29, impressed on his debut in the Coca Cola Cup defeat at Rotherham on Wednesday. He said: \\u2018The English game is fast and strong but football is football wherever you are.\\u2019 CLOUD 9 Mansell's record win TED MACAULEY NEWLY crowned world champion Nigel Mansell showed he really is the big boss of Formula One racing by grabbing a slice of history here yesterday. The 39-year-old Briton drove his Renault-Williams car to victory in the  Portuguese Grand Prix to clinch his ninth victory \\u2014 a record number of wins in one season. Not even the legendary Fangio, Stirling Moss or Jackie Stewart had managed to match that. It only added to the team Renault-Williams' total embarrassment at carelessly letting him go at the peak of his box office appeal and pulling power. Team owner Frank Williams must have watched his pit lane monitor with a mixture of delight and dismay as the star he is losing to Indy Car racing ripped up the record books. But he was sickened by Ayrton Senna's attack on Alain Prost, the French driver he has just signed to drive for him next season. Prost has a clause in his contract that excludes Senna from joining the Williams team. Senna, the man Williams wanted to sign, will now have completely wrecked his chances by saying: \\u2018It's terrible behaviour. \\u2018If Prost wants to be called champion for a fourth time he should come back in a sporting way. \\u2018But the way he is behaving he is like a coward. \\u2018Prost should be prepared to race anybody in any conditions \\u2014 everything has been laid on for him.\\u2019 Mansell stayed aloof from the bickering. He was magnificent in doing his job and never surrendering, or even looking like surrendering the lead he built up from the green light. He had pride at stake, deposed champion Senna to humble \\u2014 and a point to underline to the team that has negligently abandoned him to a new career in America. By the finish of yesterday's race he was 35 seconds ahead of second placed Gerhard Berger \\u2014 and had covered the equivalent distance of London to Manchester in a little more than one hour and a half. He said: \\u2018I am dead chuffed to have got that ninth win. \\u2018I just now want to win the last two races in Japan and Australia and then it's a new career for me.\\u2019 Senna was third \\u2014 just ahead of Briton Martin Brundle who was driving half blinded by oil spray over his visor. MANSELL WALL CHART \\u2014 Page 23 BUBBLING OVER: World champion Nigel Mansell celebrates his record ninth win after a brilliant drive in the Portguese Grand Prix yesterday. Cooke's England scare MATT HUGHES DEAN RICHARDS and Martin Bayfield both gave England team manager Geoff Cooke a scare before joining up with the Grand Slam squad. The two forwards, bidding for places in the England side against Canada at Wembley on October 17, were on the receiving end in their Courage League matches. Lock forward Bayfield had to leave the pitch while playing for Northampton after suffering an asthma attack. And Richards needed treatment to his back after being stamped on by Paul Ashmead before the Gloucester flanker was sent off at Leicester. But Leicester coach Ian Smith insisted: \\u2018Dean was soon okay. People who try to hurt him usually find they come off a lot worse than he does.\\u2019 Richards recovered to help Leicester to a 22-21 victory. And despite Bayfield's withdrawal, Northampton also maintained a 100 per cent record with a 21-17 win over Saracens. Champions Bath also made it two wins out of two after thrashing London Irish 42-16 thanks to two first half tries from prop Victor Ubogu. And Wasps remain the fourth undefeated club in the First Division after a 15-13 win at Harlequins. England and Quins stalwart Peter Winterbottom came through unscathed in his first match following a recent hernia operation. ROB JOY Jones on cloud nine ROBERT JONES has done more than enough to eclipse the new Moon that is rising in Welsh rugby. That was the view of Swansea team manager and former international Roger Blyth after Jones had just edged his personal battle against Llanelli's Rupert Moon at a packed Stradey Park. Current Wales scrum-half Jones helped inspire Heineken League champions Swansea to a 14-7 victory in front of Wales coach Alan Davies, who tomorrow names his team to face Italy on October 7. Moon has had plenty of backers urging Davies to pick the Scarlets' Englishman ahead of British Lion Jones, but Blyth insists: \\u2018Robert is still the best scrum-half in Britain by miles. \\u2018We shouldn't be asking whether he deserves his place. We should be building the Wales team around him, like the Australians built theirs around Nick Farr-Jones. \\u2018But we seem to have this thing in Wales about always knocking our best players and looking around to try to put forward rivals who aren't as good.\\u2019 Moon, who is bidding to join his Llanelli team-mate Tony Copsey as Wales' second English export, believed honours were even in the show-down of the two number nines. Strengths \\u2018I think it was probably a score-draw between Robert and myself. He did the things that he is good at very well and I was pleased with my own strengths,\\u2019 he said. Davies may have seen a close tussle between his two scrum halfs, but elsewhere in this gripping battle there was no question the Scarlets were the ones left blushing. Current Wales centre Scott Gibbs demolished the claims of his rival Neil Boobyer with three crunching tackles that saw the Llanelli youngster retreat into his shell. And among the forwards, Swansea's back row of skipper Stuart Davies, Alan Reynolds and Ian Davies ruled the roost, with Reynolds in particular showing he deserves immediate elevation into the international arena. In a tense, but action-packed encounter that thrilled a British club record crowd of 14,000, Swansea's match-winner proved to be a wing rejected by Wales three seasons ago. Mark Titley's try, on the stroke of half-time, was the killer blow. And though Llanelli managed a try themselves from Lyn Jones, they never looked like continuing their record scoring spree. Record Swansea next put their unbeaten record to the test against rivals Neath \\u2014 also yet to lose a game after a 32-10 win at home to Newport. Jason Ball scored 20 points including two tries. But Ball's former Neath team-mate Paul Jackson had an unhappier time in his only his third League game for Aberavon. Second-row Jackson was sent off for the first time in his career along with South Wales Police hooker Colin Hillman after the two were caught wrestling off the ball. But following the successful appeal of Cardiff's Mike Griffiths, Jackson also plans to use video evidence to appeal. \\u2018I'm going to use a video of the incident to prove I should never have been sent off,\\u2019 said Jackson. Even without Jackson, Aberavon chalked up a comfortable 24-0 success to leave the Police rooted to the foot of the table having conceded a massive 180 points in just four games. Newbridge substitute Stuart Griffiths was also sent off for stamping against Pontypridd, just six minutes after coming on. Ponty went on to win 22-3. Cardiff remain the only other unbeaten club in the First Division. They won 21-11 at Maesteg. SWANSEA scrum-half Robert Jones is out-matched by Llanelli's giant Phil Davies, but still gets in his tackle during the Heineken League battle that packed Stradey Park on Saturday JACK \\u2018N THRILL! Hull KR 6, Sheffield 19 UNHAPPY Rovers, watched by their smallest crowd for 20 years, were swept aside by the rampant Eagles. Despite greasy conditions which made handling difficult, Aussie full-back Gary Jack again proved an inspiration \\u2014 sparking the first try after 20 minutes. He raced 50 yards up the right before the ball was swept left for David Plange to dive over. Mark Aston added the touchline kick to his earlier penalty \\u2014 and then turned the screw with a drop goal. Just before half-time prop Craig O'Brien rounded off some brilliant Hull KR handling to give the 2,844 crowd something to shout about, Mike Fletcher adding the goal. But Eagles sub Hugh Waddell set up a try for winger Mark Gamson after 58 minutes, and loose forward Tony Farrell went in from 20 yards to confirm their superiority. WE COULD DO WITH A REST FROM LIVERPOOL MIKE LANGLEY LET Doctor Langley explain to you what's gone wrong at Liverpool Football Club. It's an outbreak of schizophrenia, amnesia and quadrophenia. Among the fans, not the players! In a poll, 70 per cent of fans told Football Monthly magazine that Graeme Souness must go. Another 70 per cent\\u2014 mathematically impossible, so probably the same lot \\u2014 assured a rival survey that manager Souness must stay. People suffering from schizoid confusion on such a grand scale are not normally allowed out, let alone allowed to see distressing football matches against Chesterfield and Wimbledon. But there's worse to come. Nearly a third of red Merseysiders \\u2014 29 per cent according to the samplers \\u2014 have lost their memories and believe Kenny Dalglish is responsible for Liverpool being fourth from bottom. I heard one say on Danny Baker's Saturday night show: \\u2018Dalglish is to blame for landing Souness in the mire.\\u2019 The fan sounded so convincing that, even though it was only 18 months ago, I reached for my record books to confirm the facts. DALGLISH'S Liverpool had not long recorded their biggest League win this century (7-1 at Derby) and followed it with five goals against Leeds. On the day that Dalglish left Anfield, the team were three points clear at the top and in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Some lurch, some mire! What about quadrophenia, which is hearing four sounds at once? In this case, the names of John Toshack, Alan Hansen, Kevin Keegan and Phil Thompson. I won't trouble you with the percentages of votes cast for them as new managers in the various ballots. It might only drive both of us up the poll! Once again, the supporters were undeterred by facts. Wasn't Toshack, happy in San Sebastian, the first to turn down Liverpool? Didn't Hansen, sensible man, indicate from the start that he has no interest in management? Keegan knows he's better off at Newcastle. If he ever goes anywhere, I'd bet on England. That leaves Phil Thompson, sacked from the coaching staff by Souness and now talking industrial tribunals. Thompson won 42 caps for England and captained Liverpool through some of their finest seasons. But he seems downbeat by nature and I'm not sure he has the resilience to rally a losing club. ALSO, Liverpool won't want to write off the best part of \\u00a31 million spent on recruiting Souness: \\u00a3500,000 a year salary and \\u00a3400,000 compensation to Rangers. Neither would Souness want to go as a failure. So I think he'd better roll his sleeves even higher and start repairing the damage, plenty of it caused by his own hastiness. Ray Houghton, Liverpool's star last season, was unloaded because he wanted more money or a move. Souness said: \\u2018Once a player shows the slightest glimmer of wanting to go, it's the end of them.\\u2019 Yeah? What about John Barnes then? Every time he says Italy, Liverpool give him a rise. WHERE was the judgment in paying Derby a record \\u00a35.1 million for Dean Saunders and Mark Wright only to discover that Saunders doesn't fit with Ian Rush and Wright isn't quite what he used to be? Saunders and Houghton are together now at Villa, along with Steve Staunton, who left the year before because nobody foresaw how Liverpool might need his ability to cover three positions. I've watched Liverpool from before the days of Bill Shankly but cannot recall a plague of injuries. Then Souness comes and they drop like flies for two seasons running! Rush (three knee ops), Ronnie Whelan (knee), Rob Jones (shins), Wright (hamstring) and Barnes (heel and calf) were under treatment last time. NINE out is today's bulletin but don't let that fool you into thinking the whole nine would be in if they were available. Steve Nicol, Michael Thomas and Jones are obvious misses, along with Barnes. But Barnes played only a quarter of last season, so Souness should have adjusted to his absence. \\u2018I haven't come within three players of putting out my best team,\\u2019 he was quoted as saying yesterday. A majority of managers could say the same, so we can put away the handkerchiefs. Let's look at the cause of the injuries. Are they partly due to new, over-strenuous training? It's a notion dismissed by Souness. \\u2018Nothing's changed,\\u2019 he said yesterday. \\u2018People look for reasons that aren't there.\\u2019 But the day before, he was quoted as saying, \\u2018The standard of fitness wasn't great. Something had to be done\\u2019. How's that for a contradiction? Injuries are the only crisis, according to Souness. But I think he's also part of the problem. HIRE-EM, fire-em \\u2014 his winning policy at Ibrox \\u2014 won't work in a League where he's not the biggest fish with the deepest purse. Thirteen championships, four European Cups, four FA Cups, four League Cups and two UEFA Cups inside 30 years are more than enough for one club, I say. We could do with a rest from Liverpool. Maybe it's Souness's destiny to take them back to where Shankly found them. In the Second Division. Arsenal excepted, that's where I've seen all of the Premier League play at some time \\u2014 Manchester United, Spurs, Aston Villa, Leeds United and Everton among them. In the long run, a little relegation did them no harm. That's the consolation I offer to Souness. But if Football Monthly's readers' poll is correct, he won't be there to enjoy it! \\u2018When you walk through a storm hold your head up high\\u2019 AS the song says, Graeme Souness won't have to walk alone when he's backed by the experience of Roy Evans and Ronnie Moran. But they were up in arms on Saturday as Liverpool crashed to Wimbledon. Picture: HARRY McGUIRE IT'S A FACT UNITED FRONT ONLY five games attracted crowds bigger than 20,000, the highest being at Old Trafford where 33,287 saw the goalless draw with QPR. 434,798\\u2026was the total attendance at 42 English League matches. The same week-end last year (41 matches) amounted to\\u2026388,013 LOWEST CONTROVERSIAL Cambridge United have the lowest League average with just five goals from nine matches. HIGHEST SOARAWAY Newcastle United have the highest League goal average with 20 from eight matches. CLIVE'S USER BOOST CHARLES FAWCUS CLIVE BRITTAIN turned User Friendly into a sprinter on Saturday morning to put her spot on for the Arc. And the triple classic winner flew across Newmarket Heath so fast that Clive is brimming with confidence that she can stay unbeaten next Sunday. \\u2018User Friendly did absolutely nothing for a week after the St Leger and got so full of herself that we nearly had to tie her down,\\u2019 smiled Clive. \\u2018George Duffield let her breeze along for six furlongs on Saturday morning and she just flew. He was delighted with her and so was I. \\u2018Now all she needs is a bit of work over a mile and a quarter on Tuesday and she'll be ready for Longchamp. She's the one they have to beat. \\u2018I don't take any notice of this  pessimistic talk about statistics being against Leger winners in the Arc. I have done things before that no one else has achieved like winning the Japan Cup with Jupiter Island and the Breeders Cup with Pebbles.\\u2019 Dr Devious has his final pre-Arc gallop this morning: \\u2018I wish I was in as good shape as the horse \\u2014 I've got permanent toothache at the moment,\\u2019 said trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam. Peter rates Dr Devious well recovered from his Leopardstown battle with St Jovite while Jim Bolger is confident that the Irish Derby winner is back on song as well. Farloe double dashed HARRY LLOYD QUALIFYING failure Manx Treasure (5-2) dramatically ended Farloe Melody's Derby double dreams in Dublin on Saturday. Quaint Irish rules allow for a second bite of the \\u00a350,000 cherry, but there were no squawks from Melody's English owners. The Daily Mirror/Sporting Life Derby hero loomed up menacingly behind Manx Treasure at the third bend. But Melody (6-4 fav), feeling the strain of a gruelling season, failed by three and a half lengths to pull back the Isle of Man-owned winner. The fast closing Radical Prince (7-1), who also failed his qualifier outstayed Melody for second place. With \\u00a380,000 already in the bank, Melody retires with a \\u00a3500,000 stud career ahead of him. Banker Forecast double dabblers have a ready made banker bet in Capolla Jack and Water Drip at Crayford tonight. Both are course and distance hurdle winners \\u2014 Capolla Jack in record time. Sam McCluskie's Foot Tripper should follow up last Monday's impressive Wembley win with a repeat course and distance performance. It may pay to be early at Catford where Dromina Duke looks the part in the second race. Punters who burned their fingers on Picton at Romford should give the unlucky Kim Marlow runner another chance. Match race contenders Winsor Abbey and Lets All Boogie eye each other up at Walthamstow tomorrow but in different heats of the Laurent Perrier Champagne Grand Prix. Connections say the \\u00a320,000 confrontation is still on and TV coverage could be on the cards. Ladbrokes are to bet ante-post on Sunderland's first Sunday meeting on October 11. There are no afternoon BAGS meetings today. ON THE SPOT Leeds 2, Everton 0 JOHN EDWARDS HOWARD KENDALL pointed an accusing finger at defender Gary Ablett over the two-goal burst that sent Everton home empty-handed. Everton were surviving a Leeds siege thanks to Neville Southall's brilliance when Ablett erred for the first time. The former Liverpool centre-back lunged in on Gary McAllister and sent the Leeds skipper sprawling for a penalty in the 61st-minute. And when he lost possession on the edge of his own area three minutes later, McAllister again capitalised with a near-post cross that one-time Everton target Lee Chapman headed home. Ablett argued furiously with referee Ken Redfern that he'd made a clean challenge on the inspirational McAllister. But Kendall was in no mood to sympathise, saying: \\u2018As far as I'm concerned, the penalty was down to poor defending. \\u2018Never mind the rights or wrongs of the decision, we should never have given the referee the opportunity to give a penalty in a situation like that. \\u2018McAllister was heading away from the danger area, and the last thing you do is dive in and risk conceding a spot-kick. \\u2018What you should do is simply stand on your feet and make sure you don't commit yourself. \\u2018We made two basic errors and paid with a goal each time, and I'm not happy about that.\\u2019 A stony-faced Ablett refused to comment as he left the ground. But he wasn't the only one in the dock after a punchless show that, in Kendall's words, \\u2018lacked penetration.\\u2019 KENDALL: Errors PEARL & DEAN! A man for all seasons Blackburn 2, Oldham 0 ALEC JOHNSON KENNY DALGLISH has come to see a side of Alan Shearer that he never knew existed when he shelled out \\u00a33.3 million on the England striker. The Blackburn manager is just knocked out by the worldly-wise maturity of the genial Geordie, still aged only 22. \\u2018You would be proud to have him as your son,\\u2019 said Dalglish who has never been easily impressed. He added: \\u2018Alan is a man. He is an adult in his thoughts and his manners and is a very mature 22-year-old footballer.\\u2019 Shearer is set to match Gary Lineker not only for his goals, but his impeccable behaviour and laid-back attitude. He had spent the week driving back and forth between Blackburn and Southampton where his wife gave birth last Monday to their first child. But Shearer took it all in his electric stride. \\u2018I've lost count of the hundreds of miles I've covered and it has been pretty hectic. But this was the perfect end to the week,\\u2019 he said. Again, it was no ordinary goal that Shearer scored, but an absolute gem. He pounced in the 30th minute, rifling home a super shot from 20 yards in the twinkling of an eye. Dalglish, himself a master marksman, said: \\u2018The way Alan struck that one was just terrific, a real striker's goal.\\u2019 It was his tenth Premier League goal in ten games, prompting reporters to ask Dalglish if Shearer is as good as Ian Rush. \\u2018I don't know because I have only played with Rush,\\u2019 said Dalglish. \\u2018But we don't have to make comparisons between him and anybody.\\u2019 Shearer not only scored, but also ran the Oldham defence ragged, leaving Latics' defender Ian Marshall gasping: \\u2018He is the best striker around. \\u2018I reckon he will hold on to that England No. 9 shirt for years to come.\\u2019 Marshall and fellow defender Richard Jobson were both booked in the space of a minute for pulling down Shearer as he twice homed in on goal shortly after half time. Stuart Ripley headed Blackburn's second from Mark Atkins' pin-point cross after 61 minutes in a glittering all-round show from Dalglish's expensive cast of stars. Oldham's attack had a fruitless afternoon against a Rovers' rearguard in which Kevin Moran was outstanding. Oldham's one hope came with a dubious second half penalty award when Colin Hendry was ruled to have pushed Ian Olney. But Marshall's spot kick was well saved by keeper Bobby Mimms. Now next in Shearer's sights are Premier League leaders Norwich who visit Ewood Park for an all-ticket clash on Saturday. Rovers will go top of the table if they can score the goals to burst the Canaries' bubble. And canny Kenny says he knows a man who can. Shear joy of the Rovers HOT-SHOT Alan Shearer wheels away to accept the plaudits after spoiling Oldham keeper Jon Hallworth's day with a superb 20-yard strike HITCH IN TIME NEIL SILVER CHELSEA manager Ian Porterfield is still searching for a top class goalkeeper despite the heroics of stand-in Kevin Hitchcock. Hitchcock has yet to concede a goal since stepping in for Dave Beasant. The 30-year-old reserve \\u2018keeper, who is on a week-to-week contract, has starred in two away wins plus Saturday's goalless draw with Forest. But, when asked whether he was still looking for a new goalkeeper despite Hitchcock's form, Porterfield said: \\u2018We are always looking to improve our squad of players and we will keep searching.\\u2019 Porterfield has been linked recently with Liverpool's Bruce Grobbelaar and Southampton's Tim Flowers. Glenn's sour grapes Charlton 2, Swindon 0 IAN GIBB GLENN Hoddle rubbished Charlton by saying: \\u2018We were attractive but football lost today.\\u2019 The Swindon player-boss rounded on the First Division Londoners. He added: \\u2018They are dogged and soak up pressure \\u2014 but they don't play the way I like to see the game played.\\u2019 But Charlton joint manager Alan Curbishley said: \\u2018They slaughtered us for half an hour \\u2014 but only half an hour. \\u2018Don't forget that apart from our goals by Scott Minto and Kim Grant, we also hit a post and Colin Walsh missed a great chance.\\u2019 Artful Allen slays Knight Pompey 0, W.Ham 1 TONY STENSON POMPEY keeper Alan Knight turned in a spectacular display that stopped West Ham running riot. His one-man show yesterday failed to prevent the Hammers moving to fourth in the First Division but it saved Pompey from embarrassment. Knight made just one mistake and that allowed Clive Allen to score with his usual efficiency. Manager Billy Bonds said: \\u2018This was the best we have played away in the two and half years I have been in charge. \\u2018It was a tremendous performance and Knight kept them in the game. More goals would have been the icing on the cake.\\u2019 West Ham's Trevor Morley could have had a hatful during a one-sided second half but Knight's brilliance and some missed chances stopped Pompey from being  overwhelmed . But the keeper was to blame when he missed a simple cross and Allen scored with ease. Later, Colin Clarke found the net but was ruled to have handled \\u2014 and that was the only time Pompey threatened. The brilliant Martin Allen and Peter Butler ran the midfield and fed Morley at regular intervals but Knight used every part of his body to stem the tide. Hammers Julian Dicks and Martin Allen were booked, as were Pompey pair Warren Aspinall and Clarke. Pompey boss Jim Smith said afterwards: \\u2018West Ham are the best side we have played all season, even better than Newcastle. \\u2018They didn't just outplay us a bit\\u2014 it was a lot. They ran us off the rails.\\u2019 ALLEN: On target MORLEY: Missed STU-POT! focus on two cases of capital punishment Kid Graham in a blue mood Chelsea 0, Forest 0 NIGEL CLARKE GRAHAM STUART, Chelsea's England Under 21 midfield star, will seek show-down talks with manager Ian Porterfield this week. Stuart, unhappy at being left out of this bore draw, said: \\u2018To say I am not happy is an understatement. \\u2018I am going to have to see the boss about it. At this stage of my career this is no good to me.\\u2019 Watched by England number two Lawrie McMenemy, Stuart did get on as a 64th minute substitute, but added: \\u2018It seems everyone else gets straight back into the side after injury except me. \\u2018I started off the season feeling great and scoring goals, but now I'm right back on the floor again.\\u2019 Award Stuart grabbed two in his first five matches before getting hurt, including one that is a contender for BBC TV's \\u2018Goal of the Month\\u2019 award. But Porterfield said: \\u2018Stuart is a very talented player but Eddie Newton, who has replaced him, has done ever so well with three goals in seven matches. \\u2018There is competition for places at the club now, and that's just how it should be.\\u2019 Stuart is too good to be kept on the sidelines at a time when England have looked to include him in the B squad as the next stage of his international career. But while Stuart frets about first team football, Robert Fleck, also fed up, stays in the side. Fleck, Chelsea's record buy at \\u00a32.5 million, has scored only once in 10 games \\u2014 his worst-ever run. But Porterfield said: \\u2018There is no question of us leaving him out. \\u2018He'll start doing what he was bought for \\u2014 scoring goals.\\u2019 But even Fleck wonders when. \\u2018It's my dream to get a goal at the Bridge, to knock one in for the home fans,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Right now that's my main target. I'm desperate to score. \\u2018It does worry me the longer it goes on without one. It's always in the back of my mind. \\u2018Chelsea bought me to score, but I don't know when or where the next one is coming from.\\u2019 The little Scot plays with his heart and soul, and perhaps is trying too hard. The only time Chelsea really rattled a troubled Forest side was when David Lee hit a 30-yarder against a post. But Forest didn't do much threatening either, largely because their brilliant young midfielder, Roy Keane, is being played at centre-back. The sooner boss Brian Clough buys a centre-half the better, for Keane is wasted as a central defender. Keane's Republic of Ireland team-mate, Chelsea skipper Andy Townsend, said: \\u2018Roy is no longer a threat when he's in the back-four. He is one of the best midfield players in the country, and he's so quick to get into the box. \\u2018I had a word with him after the match, and asked him how he was getting on. Tighter \\u2018He said he was just asked to do a job \\u2014 and it's working.\\u2019 Unbeaten in their last three games, Forest are tighter at the back, but Townsend added: \\u2018Roy will want to get back into midfield as soon as possible. It's no secret that Cloughie is searching for a centre-half.\\u2019 Without Keane to run the game, Forest have lost their cutting edge. They still play attractive football, but there is no end product. They came for a draw and got it. THAT'S ROUGH, CLOUGHIE: Sunshine can't brighten a dull draw for Forest boss Brian Clough (centre) and coaches Archie Gemmill and Liam O'Kane Picture: KENT GAVIN Forrest plea Ipswich 0, Sheffield United 0 SENT-OFF Ipswich keeper Craig Forrest pleaded his innocence after bringing down United striker Adrian Littlejohn outside the penalty area after just two minutes. Canadian international Forrest, 24, faces a three-match ban after referee Ron Groves confirmed the red card was for serious foul play. \\u2018I am very, very upset. There is no way I would ever want to injure an opponent,\\u2019 Forrest insisted. Eddie Youds made way for sub keeper Clive Baker who held out for Ipswich's eighth draw. Kevin fury Coventry 1, Norwich 1 NEIL SILVER KEVIN Gallacher accused Norwich's Chris Sutton of upending him with a professional foul and blasted: \\u2018I've seen people sent off for less.\\u2019 Centre half Sutton escaped with just a booking for the 52nd minute incident. But Gallacher said: \\u2018I felt my jersey being pulled and a push in the back. I could not understand why it was suggested I was a cheat.\\u2019 Sutton pleaded his innocence and said: \\u2018I think he was looking for the dive. I made a fair attempt for the ball.\\u2019 Ian Crook gave Norwich a 13th minute lead, but Peter Ndlovu equalised with a stunning solo goal eight minutes before the break. GALLACHER: Accused PEARL & DEAN Ace Saunders is the spark Middlesbrough 2, Aston Villa 3 MATT HUGHES THE dramatic arrival of Dean Saunders has given Dalian Atkinson a new lease of life at Aston Villa. Atkinson's Ayresome Park performance showed he is relishing the chance to play alongside the \\u00a32.3 million new boy. Yet Atkinson revealed he was on the verge of quitting during a never-ending battle against injury last season. \\u2018I got to the point where I didn't want to play again,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018I had one injury after another and it was doing my head in. \\u2018Now I'm alongside Dean and we're creating so many chances. The law of averages says we'll score a few.\\u2019 Hunger Saunders was on target twice and Atkinson claimed the other as Villa replaced Middlesbrough in the Premier League's top six. \\u2018We'll work well together, but I don't expect too many favours because Dean has such a great hunger for goals,\\u2019 smiled Atkinson. Manager Ron Atkinson agreed: \\u2018Goals are Dean's lifeblood. \\u2018I think back to people like Allan Clarke, who were annoyed if they came off the pitch without scoring a goal. \\u2018Dean's like that, but he also a bit different to the majority of strikers because he's also a grafter.\\u2019 That's not an adjective the Villa manager would apply to his namesake in the team. \\u2018It must have been a great game to watch \\u2014 Dalian seemed to think so,\\u2019 said the Villa boss. Ron wasn't entirely joking. Atkinson the manager spent most of the second half demanding more effort from Atkinson the striker. \\u2018Dean has told him he would do all his running and Dalian decided here was the guy he had waited for throughout his career,\\u2019 said the Villa manager. The striker was still too hot for Boro's overworked defenders to handle, although Big Ron insisted: \\u2018He's not a fraction of the player he will be.\\u2019 Villa still refuse to shout the odds over their undoubted title potential. Bold \\u2018I'll be bold enough to say we won't be relegated,\\u2019 said Atkinson. But Boro boss Lennie Lawrence insisted: \\u2018They're championship contenders, but didn't have to be at their best to beat us. \\u2018The danger was there for all to see, but we failed to heed the warning,\\u2019 he groaned. \\u2018Their front two cut us to pieces. \\u2018Villa totally outclassed us in the first half and we were extremely lucky only to be a goal down. When we got back into it with an equaliser, our defensive naivity flared again.\\u2019 Saunders is the spark DEAN'S DOUBLE VILLA goal ace Dean Saunders splits the Boro defence to rifle home his second of the afternoon as Ron Atkinson's side hit the title trail. By MATT HUGHES Msboro 2 A.Villa 3  DEAN'S DOUBLE VILLA goal ace Dean Saunders splits the Boro defence to rifle home his second of the afternoon as Ron Atkinson's side hit the title trail. Dowie power Palace 1, Saints 2 TONY STENSON IAIN DOWIE wasn't even listed by the bookies as a potential scorer of the first goal. But when the injured Kerry Dixon inquired, he was offered 10-1. He laid out a fiver \\u2014 and went home counting the cash after Dowie scored twice. Dowie is a target for the Saints boo-boys but his willing heart makes him a dressing room favourite. He says: \\u2018The fans have been frustrated because we haven't scored but all we can do is to try and put it right. Dowie power KASEY PROVEN FOR MICK Brentford 1, Millwall 1 MILLWALL'S American import Kasey Keller bounced back from his clanger at Highbury to pull off two brilliant saves to keep the Lions alive. The American international boobed by letting a Kevin Campbell shot through his legs on Tuesday, but won praise on Saturday. \\u2018He is a great shot-stopper as well as a great athlete. He was saying sorry on Tuesday but you couldn't fault him here,\\u2019 said Lions boss Mick McCarthy. \\u2018I was upset after the Arsenal game,\\u2019 admitted Keller. \\u2018It was good to come back and give a good performance here.\\u2019 Steve's silence Watford 0, Leicester 3 STEVE Perryman admits a new striker is his priority but he will not say if fans can expect good news this week. His team were booed off at Vicarage Road after their eighth game without a win. \\u2018I don't want to wind people up and create an expectancy,\\u2019 said boss Perryman after Watford's second successive three-goal defeat in the League. Steve's silence FIRED UP Niall gunning for Arsenal NEIL SILVER NIALL QUINN is hoping to kick-start his season into action against his old club at Highbury tonight. The Manchester City striker has scored just once so far this season \\u2014 so he has a major incentive to score against Arsenal in this televised tussle. The 6ft 4in hitman said: \\u2018I don't think my season has really started yet but I hope to rectify that now. \\u2018I needed last Wednesday's Coca-Cola Cup game against Bristol Rovers to get me back into the swing of things after a three-match suspension. \\u2018Hopefully I will reap the benefit of that at Arsenal, where we will all have to be in top form to get anything.\\u2019 Goal-shy City will be delighted if Quinn can get back on target. They have failed to score in their last three matches, all at home, losing two in the League and being held to a 0-0 draw in the Cup. Selfish Quinn has promised to be selfish in his quest for goals. But that is fine by his strike partner David White. \\u2018David and I have had a chat about the goal drought which has suddenly hit the team,\\u2019 explained Quinn. \\u2018We feel we have been considering each other too much. We have been trying to lay on chances for each other. \\u2018We have decided that the answer from now on is to be greedy so-and-sos. If either of us get a chance for goal, we will go for it.\\u2019 But Arsenal, desperate to put together a winning sequence themselves after a dismal start, will be in a tough mood. Tony Adams, the Arsenal skipper, says: \\u2018Niall and I are great friends and have been since he came over here 10 years ago. But when we go out on the pitch, I hope he has a stinker. \\u2018We have lost four games recently that we never deserved to lose so it's been a hard time for us. \\u2018But we will come through. There's too much quality at the club for us to stay down for long. \\u2018We just need to put a couple of wins together and then the ball will be rolling again.\\u2019 QUINN: Only one goal SHEER EL AS NICK BLOWS UP NICK FALDO dropped six shots in ten disastrous holes yesterday \\u2014 and gifted the Belgian Open title to Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez. Nightmare Nick, three ahead at the eighth, took 42 on the back nine and left Jimenez to pocket \\u00a3100,000 with a 274 aggregate. Patty Sheehan shot a final-round 67 at Woburn to become the first woman to win the US and British Opens in the same year. FALDO: S-painful KOPPED But chairman backs Souness Liverpool 2, Wimbledon 3 RICHARD TANNER LIVERPOOL chairman David Moores last night broke his silence over the Anfield crisis to insist: \\u2018We're backing Graeme Souness.\\u2019 Moores admitted he was \\u2018worried\\u2019 about the Mersey maestros\\u2019worst start to a season since 1953, but he said the club's eight-man board is \\u2018fully behind\\u2019Souness. The 39-year-old Scot's worries increased after more alarming defensive lapses led to Saturday's defeat. Millionaire Moores, a member of the Littlewoods pools family, is well aware of the discontent on the terraces. But the man whose first year as chairman has co-incided with the most traumatic period in Liverpool's history, spoke out to ease the pressure on Souness. He said: \\u2018The board fully supports the manager \\u2014 and I'm certain Graeme is just as concerned as anyone else. Hopeful \\u2018But how can you judge a team when seven of the top players are out? Really the time to judge is when we have a full-strength squad. \\u2018Obviously, as a Liverpool fan, you have to be worried but I'm perfectly hopeful that we'll get through this and come back as the force that we always have been.\\u2019 And Wimbledon boss Joe Kinnear, after watching his side deepen Liverpool's crisis, also backed his old Spurs pal Souness. Kinnear said: \\u2018It was a marvellous display by our lads \\u2014 but the fans up here seem to be getting hysterical. \\u2018It's rubbish. Souness remains one of the most respected managers in football. \\u2018Given time and with his new Danish defensive partner Torben Piechnik were on different wavelengths. Both hardened internationals, they couldn't cope with John Fashanu and Robbie Earle as they plundered the first and third goals for Dons. Punch And red-faced Brucie, brought back to steady the ship, blundered for the second goal, racing to the edge of his area to punch straight to Earle who sent a superbly-judged lob back over him from 25 yards. Liverpool came back from 2-0 down to be level at the break thanks to Jan Molby's penalty and McManaman's tap-in. But Earle's 75th minute winner exposed the frailty for all to see. WOBBLER: Bruce Grobbelaar's return made little difference to Liverpool's leaking defence. Derby stars pay price Derby 2, Southend 0 DERBY'S expensive newcomers are weighed down by their price tags revealed record \\u00a32.3million signing Craig Short. He even sold himself short saying: \\u2018I should have scored three. If we had lost or drawn the fans would have blamed me.\\u2019 But he says the arrival of \\u00a3650,000 Martin Kuhl from Portsmouth could be just the tonic County's under-pressure stars need. \\u2018They are very quiet on the pitch and that shows the tension they are under,\\u2019 Short declared. \\u2018They have lost confidence, but Martin is just the player who can get them going and I think you will see their true character soon. \\u2018He did a great job just sitting in there and keeping everything tight \\u2014 and he never stopped shouting and goading the youngsters.\\u2019 Kuhl admitted: \\u2018Derby have some very exciting players. But you could feel the tension in them. \\u2018The fans want goals, the lads want goals \\u2014 and you could physically feel their relief when they came. Maybe we have now turned the corner.\\u2019 SHORT: Under pressure LAST BARB DAVID MOORE TESSA SANDERSON kissed the javelin goodbye yesterday \\u2014 after throwing one final jibe at arch rival Fatima Whitbread. Sanderson, now 36, scattered her World Cup opponents in the opening round, launching a throw of 61.86 metres. Then she said: \\u2018The record books will show I was Britain's best. I've got to be rated at number one, ahead of Fatima.\\u2019 Robbie's a gem ROBBIE Earle deepened Liverpool's misery with a brilliant display that can only enhance his England chances. But the powerhouse midfielder with the goal touch modestly handed Vinny Jones much of the credit as the Dons showed again their liking for Anfield. Earle said: \\u2018Vinny comes into his own against teams like Arsenal and Liverpool. He's one of life's great motivators. \\u2018He had me running all over. He's a natural competitor, he even beats you up if you beat him at cards.\\u2019 \\u2018He's a big influence on us and we're going to miss him when he starts his suspension.\\u2019 Earle caught the eye setting up John Fashanu's opener then he punished a poor punch by Bruce Grobbelaar with a superbly-judged 25-yard lob. After Liverpool pulled level the non-stop Earle pounced on a Fashanu knock-down to score the winner. No wonder the Dons are Liverpool's bogey side. Their Anfield record now reads played seven, won three, drawn two and lost two. ROCKET FOR APOLLON CYPRIOT club Apollon, Liverpool's hosts in this week's second leg Cup Winners Cup-tie, were involved in a riot on Saturday that led to a referee's strike and postponement of yesterday's Cyprus League games. A disputed penalty in the last minute of the game with Omonia gave Apollon a 4-4 draw after being 4-2 behind with three minutes to go. Omonia supporters chased the ref off the pitch, then tore down the steel dressing-room doors. Mac's tough lesson IAN GIBB THERE was a wicked gleam in the eye of Paul Hodkinson as he watched Colin McMillan getting ripped apart in his WBO world featherweight title. Kirkby's Hoko, himself the WBC world champion at nine stone, had just watched unfancied, virtually washed-up Colombian Ruben Palacio teach brilliant Barking boxer McMillan some harsh truths about life in the spit-and-sawdust cockpit of the big fight league. McMillan was stopped in the eighth round because his left arm had been viciously dislocated from its shoulder socket \\u2014 but at the time our Colin was hanging on for grim life. The protests flew thick and fast that McMillan should have been allowed to keep his crown because he was, mystifyingly, three rounds ahead on two judges' scorecards and, more realistically, one in front on another. But Hodkinson had seen more than enough. If their domestic showdown does ever take place, he reckons: \\u2018I have to say it would be easy money for me.\\u2019 The World Boxing Organisation yesterday installed McMillan as the mandatory challenger to Palacio because of the \\u2018unusual circumstances\\u2019 surrounding the defeat, which keeps the Hoko show-down still a possibility. McMillan was kept in hospital overnight as a precaution and was in a great deal of pain with his dislocated shoulder, plus the cuts and bruises he had to suffer. Sorry, Colin, but you learned the hard way about the harsh truths of the boxing world. McMILLAN: Pounded Regal Neal SNOOKER star Neal Foulds was back in the winners' enclosure at Motherwell last night after a four-year wait. The 29-year-old greyhound racing lover pocketed the \\u00a340,000 first prize by beating unseeded Gary Wilkinson 10-8 in the Regal Masters final. \\u2018It's a great feeling to get another title under my belt,\\u2019 said Foulds whose last success came in the 1988 Dubai Duty Free Masters. MOVE OVER LIVERPOOL! picture special on the record-breaking Magpies We can be top of Kops \\u2014 Kev Peterborough 0, Newcastle 1 HUGH JAMIESON KEVIN KEEGAN watched Newcastle maintain an eight-match 100 per cent First Division record and warned: \\u2018We could be bigger than Liverpool.\\u2019 Keegan should know, having spent six sizzling years at Anfield under Bill Shankly scooping a treasure trove of honours. But now the Magpies are on the march again, nine years after Keegan guided them back into the top flight before sensationally swapping fog on the Tyne for the sunshine of Spain. Eight months after King Kevin was tempted out of retirement to save Newcastle from relegation, the Geordie hordes are in full cry. Frightening More than 5,000 have been locked out of St James's Park for each of the last two games and Keegan gasped: \\u2018The fans are amazing. \\u2018If we continue to progress and produce the goods, then we can become bigger and more exciting than Liverpool. \\u2018We're playing some superb football but what is awesome is that we are getting better. \\u2018There's no pressure on us. In fact, it's been diverted to the opposition as they try to stop us because with our kind of support we're frightening teams.\\u2019 Dream Now Keegan has set his side's next target \\u2014 cracking the League record of 13 straight victories at the start of season created by Reading in 1985. \\u2018People keep saying the run must end, but why should it?\\u2019 he said. \\u2018You dream about situations like this, and the way things are going you feel it can go on forever. \\u2018But whatever happens we're providing a platform for the season that is exciting. The fans know it and it's a joy to be involved.\\u2019 Keegan's proposed Merseyside take-over was backed by Republic of Ireland midfielder Kevin Sheedy, whose 60th-minute goal sent Newcastle's 8,000 travelling army celebrating all the way back up the A1. Sheedy, 33 next month, arrived on Tyneside on a free transfer from Everton within days of Keegan's return. And the man whose glory days at Goodison included League championship, FA Cup and European Cup-Winners' Cup medals insisted: \\u2018This situation is even bigger than my experience at Everton. The fans are more fanatical and although we had some great times at Goodison, this could be something else. \\u2018I like to think my experience is a vital factor in midfield because obviously the side is still developing with the introduction of new players. \\u2018I might be 33 soon but that doesn't worry me. I'm in very good physical shape and that's the way it's got to be because there's so much at stake with Newcastle and the Republic's World Cup qualifying campaign. \\u2018But the side looks well balanced \\u2014 and the way we are playing I honestly believe it will take something special to stop us. There is no way complacency will ever be allowed to creep in.\\u2019 Sheedy's trusty left foot did the trick, taking Robert Lee's pass in his stride to coax Ian Bennett off his line and chip the ball coolly over the Posh keeper's head. Until then 21-year-old Bennett, shown the door at Newcastle on a free transfer two seasons ago, had produced a brilliant one-man show of defiance. For although David Kelly and Lee both hit the woodwork, Bennett brought off a string of super saves. Promising Lee, signed for \\u00a3700,000 from Charlton and making a highly promising League debut, joined Kelly, Mick Quinn and Lee Clark on the brilliant Bennett's list of point-blank \\u2018victims\\u2019. Yet despite one way traffic at times, Newcastle will have to tighten up at the heart of a defence that looked vulnerable. Twice Tony Adcock was superbly stopped by keeper Tommy Wright. Then the Posh striker laid on a glorious chance six minutes from the end, only for substitute Pat Gavin to mis-time his header completely with the goal at his mercy.

GAZZA'S RETURN ENDS IN PAIN WITH THE CRY OF\\u2026 Moment of agony HARRY HARRIS PAUL GASCOIGNE lasted only 45 minutes of his league debut for Lazio here yesterday \\u2014 but he insisted that he has survived his first crunching tackle in Italian football. The \\u00a35.5 million star endured a heart-stopping few minutes against Genoa, crashing to the ground after a tackle and clutching the same knee in which he ruptured ligaments 16 months ago. He did not appear for the second-half of the match, which ended in a 1-1 draw, raising fears the knee had been badly damaged and that his career would again be threatened. But Gazza said: \\u2018It's nothing really. I took a knock on the knee but it's not serious. \\u2018The main thing I remember is just how deadly quiet the whole stadium went when I was tackled. \\u2018As I was going off at half-time, the lad who tackled me came up and said \\u2018I'm sorry, but it was only a little tap\\u2019.\\u2019 Lazio's doctor Claudio Bartolini explained that it will be 24 hours before he can make a true assessment of the damage. Gazza had to call a halt before a 46,000 crowd here in the Olympic Stadium when a challenge from Mario Bortolazzi stretched the right knee that has undergone two major operations. Bartolini revealed how Gazza was \\u2018scared\\u2019 by the impact of the crunching challenge. He said: \\u2018There is no distortion of the knee. He was caught on the sciatic nerve and suffered only a dead-leg and an abrasion. \\u2018This has been a good test for his knee and we don't think it is a big problem. But we will need 24 hours to assess it. \\u2018It's the kind of kick that would be a problem on a normal knee for only one week. \\u2018I don't know if he will fit to play for Lazio next week. It is too early to make that decision.\\u2019 Bartolini also admitted: \\u2018We were a little bit worried when it happened and, of course, he was a little bit scared. But there is nothing to worry about now. \\u2018Now he must get accustomed to these kind of kicks. \\u2018He didn't ask to leave the field. But I said it was better for him if he didn't go back.\\u2019 Lazio may well have been planning to allow Gazza only an hour's play in any event as he tried to gain match fitness. Dino Zoff, the Lazio manager, decided to pick Gazza only on Saturday \\u2014 and to tell him shortly before the kick-off. \\u2018Maybe he would have played a few minutes more,\\u2019 said Zoff. \\u2018But it's not a big accident. He didn't give me the impression of being badly injured. \\u2018I will see Paul's condition before making a decision on whether to play him against Parma next week.\\u2019 Drama Zoff detailed the drama behind the scenes as Gazza was kept on tenterhooks for the past four days, wondering whether he would make his Italian debut. Zoff said: \\u2018I wanted to make an evaluation of his condition after his appearance against Tottenham on Wednesday. I wanted to wait to see if there was any reaction after that match. \\u2018On Saturday I saw he was in good condition and decided to play him. \\u2018When I told him he was playing he was moved. He showed a strong character. \\u2018I thought he did quite well in the first-half of his first official match. But of course I had to remove him from the field.\\u2019 Before he was injured Gazza showed flashes of his genius. He played a controlled, holding game in mid-field, allowing the German Thomas Doll to take a more attacking role. It was a rough match with five bookings but Lazio will not be complaining \\u2014 they took a million pounds in receipts. Pic: ARNOLD SLATER Wright not for sale RICHARD TANNER SKIPPER Mark Wright was the centre of transfer speculation last night as Liverpool flew here for their European Cup Winners' Cup second leg tie against Apollon Limassol. Wright, a \\u00a32.2m buy from Derby last season, stayed behind for treatment to a dead leg he suffered in the defeat by Wimbledon. But the England centre-half denied his absence from tonight's match had anything to do with a weekend newspaper report that Liverpool were ready to sell him. A Liverpool spokesman said yesterday: \\u2018I don't know where these stories come from. Mark Wright is going nowhere.\\u2019 Liverpool, who hold a 6-1 lead from the first leg, expect the support of around 4,500 fans for a match that has put the Cypriot police on alert because Juventus, the other Heysel disaster club, are also in action on the island. WRIGHT: Injury Diego's dazzler DIEGO Maradona made all three goals in his comeback match for Seville in a friendly against Bayern Munich in Spain last night. The Argentine superstar, until recently the undisputed greatest footballer in the world, had his every move cheered by the 40,000 crowd. He prowled the midfield often at half-pace \\u2014 he is still a stone overweight \\u2014 pulling the Bayern defence this way and that. It was a memorable return for the man who seemed to have ended his career a convicted cocaine user in Naples. ROBBO JOY! Bryan is back for United KEN LAWRENCE MANCHESTER United skipper Bryan Robson will be standing by this afternoon to make a sensational comeback against Torpedo Moscow. Robson, 35, has not seen first-team action for five months due to hamstring and sciatica problems, but last Saturday he played 80 minutes of an A team game. Boss Alex Ferguson may now gamble on his veteran as United prepare for the second leg of this UEFA Cup tie with the scores at 0-0. Torpedo have never lost a European tie on their dilapidated old ground and Ferguson knows Robson's experience could be vital. He said: \\u2018If Robbo does play, then we can expect that he will \\u2018go\\u2019 before the end of the match. \\u2018I might get only an hour, or perhaps only half a game from him. \\u2018But the thing about Robbo is that he is a determined  beggar and I know that if I ask him, he will say OK if he's ready. Ferguson is prepared to risk Robson because another of United's Englishmen, Lee Martin, is unlikely to face the Russians because of a stomach bug. Ferguson will delay his decision until after a light training session this morning. \\u2018Before I go to speak to Robbo about it, I want one last look,\\u2019 said the manager. \\u2018If I do ask him, and he says he's ready, that will only confirm my thoughts.\\u2019 Robson last played against Liverpool in April when United's championship hopes finally crashed. Anchor If he plays today, the former England skipper is likely to play in front of the back four as anchor man, while his colleagues search for the away goal that would put the dour Muscovites under pressure. \\u2018The great thing about Robbo is that he brings that bit extra out of people,\\u2019 said Ferguson. The manager will play Ryan Giggs from the start after leaving him out of the first leg due to a mix-up over UEFA rules governing foreign and assimilated players. The other non-English players today will be Brian McClair, keeper Peter Schmeichel, Mark Hughes and Denis Irwin. Ferguson said: \\u2018It will be a very tight game and I do not expect the Russians to be too adventurous. \\u2018The pitch is huge and the longer the match goes on, the better that should be for us. We will not be worried about extra time or penalties with big Peter in goal.\\u2019 RED GUARD IT'S hats off to Alex Ferguson as he gets out and about in Moscow's Red Square A-WARD! MARTIN RICHARDS POWER-HOUSE prop Kevin Ward yesterday appealed to Great Britain coach Mal Reilly: \\u2018Let me have one last crack at Australia.\\u2019 The 35-year-old St Helens pack star has declared himself available for next month's World Cup Final against the Aussies. \\u2018If selected it would be my swansong on the international scene and a great way to bow out,\\u2019 said Ward. Reilly, who names his 19-man squad on October 13, was yesterday assessing the Aussie party. \\u2018They'll miss Andrew Ettingshausen and Laurie Daley, but it's still a very strong squad and they've so much talent to choose from,\\u2019 he said. Aussie squad: Meninga,(capt), Cartwright, Clyde, Brasher, Carne, Fittler, Gillespie, Godden, Hancock, Harragon, Johns, Langer, Lazarus, Lindner, Mackay, Renouf, Sargent, Sironen, Stuart, Kevin Walters, Kerrod Walters and Steve Walters. WARD: Plea WE CAN DO IT \\u2014 WILKO The lads are all bubbling JOHN EDWARDS HOWARD WILKINSON savoured the prospect yesterday of a history-making European night for Leeds and revealed why he believes they can conquer the odds. The champions have to overturn a daunting 3-0 deficit at Elland Road tomorrow night if they are to get past Stuttgart and make it into the European Cup second round. No British team have ever come back from three goals down in the history of European competition. But Wilkinson is convinced his in-form side can do it. And with good reason \\u2014 it has been done to him already! The Leeds boss still shudders at the memory of his old Sheffield Wednesday side going 4-3 down to Chelsea in a League Cup tie seven years ago after cruising at 3-0 up. Mission A Mel Sterland penalty in the last minute of extra time eventually forced a 4-4 draw. Wilkinson said: \\u2018If proof were ever needed that anything is possible in this game, then that's got to be it. \\u2018One minute we were apparently coasting home at 3-0 up, the next we were 4-3 down and wondering what had hit us. \\u2018I know some people will think it's Mission Impossible, and I can understand that. But we don't think it's impossible \\u2014 far from it. \\u2018I've noticed the players have perked up a lot since the first leg in Stuttgart. \\u2018They are looking fresher and bouncier, and I just sense there has been a lot more energy about them the past 10 days. \\u2018All the players have to lose is their self-respect, and I don't think that will happen. \\u2018I think the attitude will be that Stuttgart will only get through over our dead bodies. \\u2018What we will be aiming for on the night is to make sure we score first \\u2014 and it needn't be in the opening minutes. \\u2018If we went ahead 15 minutes from time and were performing, I would still fancy us to go through.\\u2019 Moment Fit-again Eric Cantona is desperate to atone for the moment, just seconds after he damaged a hamstring, when his misplaced pass handed Stuttgart one of their goals. \\u2018That was a crucial error which could even have made his injury worse,\\u2019 said Wilkinson. \\u2018I was resigned to him missing the return leg, but he has recovered remarkably quickly. Impact \\u2018He will be nursing a secret desire to try to make amends, even though everyone has reassured him that these things happen. \\u2018I'm just glad to have him back. He has made a big impact this season and gives us a much better chance of succeeding against Stuttgart.\\u2019 WILKINSON: Optimistic CANTONA THE AVENGER FRENCH ace Eric Cantona will be anxious to make amends for his first-leg blunder as Leeds seek to overturn a 3-0 deficit against Stuttgart. Gary just makes it FOREST boss Brian Clough has handed striker Gary Bannister a contract until the end of the season \\u2014 but only just. Bannister, 32, pleaded with Clough for a trial at the start of the season after being kicked out by West Bromwich, but he missed several chances in Saturday's 0-0 draw at Chelsea. And with Forest still at the bottom of the Premier League, Clough insisted: \\u2018If I'd waited to offer him the contract after Saturday he may have blown it. He missed a hat-trick of chances.\\u2019 Clough added: \\u2018He's earned himself a contract not because of how well he has done for us, but because I think he can carry on after 32.\\u2019 Bannister, who has hit five goals in eight games, said: \\u2018If I get 20 this season then I could earn myself an extension of the contract.\\u2019 BANNISTER: Lucky MARTYN'S CHANCE HUGH JAMIESON WELSH keeper Martyn Thomas makes a comeback for Birmingham in tonight's Anglo-Italian Cup tie against Cambridge at St Andrews. With Birmingham needing just a point to qualify for a place in Europe, 32-year-old Thomas replaces Andy Gosney, who is out for a month because of damaged shoulder ligaments. Boss Terry Cooper is furious at the Steve Bull tackle that injured Gosney in Blues' 4-0 loss to Wolves on Sunday. Cooper said: \\u2018Would you be happy if someone jumped at you with two feet?\\u2019 But Gosney admitted: \\u2018It was a 50-50 ball and one of those things that happens. \\u2018I didn't expect him to pull out because the ball was there to go for.\\u2019 On tonight's match, Cooper said: \\u2018There's a lot at stake and it gives us the opportunity to put things right.\\u2019 I NEED YOU Taylor waits for Gazza NORWAY RECALL STILL ON HARRY HARRIS GRAHAM TAYLOR yesterday announced that he's ready to fly out to Rome to watch Paul Gascoigne before naming his team for the opening World Cup tie against Norway at Wembley. Gazza shrugged off the trauma of his painful exit from his Italian Serie A debut for Lazio against Genoa to train 24 hours later. The midfield star trained alone \\u2014 sprinting, jogging, twisting and turning to answer claims that the tackle which put him out of the game would mean another lengthy lay-off, almost 17 months after he wrecked his right knee in the FA Cup final. Delighted England manager Taylor said: \\u2018That's great news to hear he is training. \\u2018I'll fly out to watch Gazza play against Parma next Sunday if he's selected for the match.\\u2019 And, the indications are that Gazza has a chance, despite being slammed by the Italian press for his first half display on Sunday. More important to Gazza will be Taylor's assessment and the England chief added: \\u2018I've watched the video of the Genoa match and before Gazza went off there were some very encouraging signs. \\u2018I'm naming the squad for the game against Norway on Thursday and, as I've already indicated, he will be included just as he was in Spain early this month. Condition \\u2018The lad needs to be involved but it's still too early for me to say whether he will play in that game.\\u2019 As well as Sunday's League match, there is an Italian Cup tie the following Wednesday for Gazza to prove he's in a good enough condition to make some contribution against Norway. But Taylor stressed: \\u2018I just have to wait and see how many games he plays over the next few weeks.\\u2019 Lazio manager Dino Zoff may have been tempted to rest Gazza against Parma, but his German ace striker Karl-Heinz Reidle is now a worse casualty with badly-damaged ankle ligaments. That leaves Zoff with foreign stars Thomas Doll and Aaron Winter, who was left out to make way for Gazza. Scared Lazio doctor Claudio Bartolini, who was scared when Gazza was first injured, said yesterday: \\u2018When I saw the accident again on TV I was very worried, but this morning I looked at it and now we are both very happy. \\u2018There's no reason why he shouldn't play on Sunday.\\u2019 General manager Maurizio Manzini was delighted Gazza was able to train and said: \\u2018Paul has been training and there's no problem. GAZZA checks the right knee after the knock that caused much alarm -but now he could play on Sunday TAYLOR: Encouraged Gazza's former Spurs team-mate Gary Lineker turned his talents to cricket yesterday and made 103 for Cross Arrows at Lord's, but his side went down to the Stock Exchange by five wickets HAPPY RETURNS CHRIS WADDLE is set for an England recall after settling his differences with boss Graham Taylor. The Sheffield Wednesday winger has been in the international wilderness since last October's match with Turkey, but the pair had talks after Wednesday's win over Spurs on Sunday. The 31-year old may well be named on Thursday when Taylor reveals his squad for next month's World Cup qualifier against Norway. Said Waddle: \\u2018There have been misunderstandings but they have been sorted out. Now we understand each other perfectly.\\u2019 And Peter Beardsley also has a \\u2018Remember Me\\u2019 message for Taylor. The Everton star believes he can throw off a hamstring strain in time for the Norway match and said: \\u2018Hopefully I'll be playing at the weekend. The leg is getting better every day.\\u2019 Liam's target KEVIN Keegan set the seal yesterday on Liam O'Brien's sizzling start to the season at Newcastle. The Newcastle boss said: \\u2018He has been a revelation, but maybe that's because this is the best team he has played in.\\u2019 The Republic of Ireland international has bounced back after his future looked in doubt following the arrival of Paul Bracewell. \\u2018I wondered why the manager bought him,\\u2019 O'Brien admitted yesterday. \\u2018We play in the same position and I thought I'd proved myself last season. \\u2018But I decided to take my chance when it came and make it hard for Paul to get back.\\u2019 Now O'Brien hopes for an international recall for the World Cup qualifier in Denmark. O'BRIEN: Revelation OWNERS STAGE PROTEST TWO of racing's most colourful owners Ken Higson and Barney Curley staged protests against the prize money at Fontwell yesterday. Higson, the owner of first-race 9-4 favourite Across The Card, went to the start and told his jockey Gary Moore not to take part. The betting market was thrown into confusion, and the stewards announced an inquiry. Then an hour later Curley took the same action with 2-1 favourite Torwada. The stewards fined Higson and Gary Moore, Curley and John Twomey, the rider of Torwada, \\u00a31,200 each. After his meeting with the stewards, Curley said: \\u2018It's a disgrace. My jockey wouldn't earn that in a year from riding.\\u2019 Higson said: \\u2018Today is one of the saddest days of my life. But I felt I had to do something to keep some sanity in racing. Certain tracks and off-course bookmakers must realise that they are rubbing our noses in the dirt. \\u2018I have the support in writing of a large number of owners and trainers in the action I have taken. My main complaint is that third place in today's hurdle race \\u2014 \\u00a386 \\u2014 does not even pay the jockey's riding fee. CARLISLE boss Aidan McCaffery was sacked yesterday after 18 months in charge. Carlisle have taken one point from the last 15 and are 18th in the Third Division. Toe the line! FRANK WIECHULA VINNY Jones revealed it was a \\u2018toe-job\\u2019 which led to Paul Gascoigne's grimace in the famous photo of their close encounter. Gazza's pain came after he got to grips with the Jones boy when he was playing for Newcastle against Wimbledon. Jones revealed: \\u2018A lot of people say to me \\u2018that put you on the map\\u2019. \\u2018In non-League you could definitely get away with it, but now all of a sudden you're in the limelight. \\u2018That incident was where we had a free-kick on our half-way line and he was just marking me tight, and there was a bit of bantering going on between us. Giggling \\u2018If the truth is known he was giggling until I went to stand back and then I trod on his toe. It shows up on one of the pictures \\u2014 and I think that's the only bit of pain he got from that.\\u2019 Jones, who talks about famous past hard-men such as Billy Bremner, Graeme Souness, Tommy Smith, Jack Charlton and Dave Mackay, then gave his interpretation of the contentious soccer term. \\u2018I mean, what is hard? Is hard not flinching in a tackle? I think that's what it means. \\u2018If the ball is there to be won and you've got to go in to win that ball for your team, then maybe you are going to be in a 40-60 situation \\u2014 and you've still got to go in. \\u2018And I think that's what these lads in this video are all about,\\u2019 Vinny added. Hard Core MAURICE Core's battering-ram right hand won him the vacant British light-heavyweight title at Manchester's New Century Hall last night. Core came from behind after suffering a second round knockdown to stop Ireland's Noel Magee after 2 minutes 34 seconds of the ninth. Core's victory provided his manager Phil Martin with his second British champion inside a week after Frank Grant's shock capture of the middleweight crown from Herol Graham in Leeds. With the steam running out of Magee, Core thumped in his big rights and referee Paul Thomas had no alternative but to step in. A split-second after the stoppage, the 26-year-old Magee crashed to the canvas taking an  embarrassed Thomas with him and needed a couple of minutes to recover before being hauled to his feet. While Core was jubilant with his victory, it was in no way a fistic feast in a division once graced by Chris Finnegan and John Conteh. There were far too many clinches and referee Thomas had to bring both men together at the start of the seventh to tell them to cut out the holding. VINNY'S VIDEO NASTY OUCH! They'll poke you in the eye OUCH! You'll catch a right hander Secrets of the hit men TONY STENSON VINNY Jones last night sensationally revealed the secrets that make him soccer's hardest man. In a video nasty, full of mayhem, broken bones and bloodied noses, Wimbledon's midfield mugger explains just why he is such a feared assassin. Jones, who was sent off for the sixth time in a five-year career against Blackburn on his Wimbledon return two weeks ago, hosts a  controversial video that makes heroes of men of great skill who play to hurt and unveils a code that includes: GIVING an opponent a lump behind the ear with an elbow at corners. A POKE in the eye when referees or fans are not looking, or when the ball's at the other end of the field the centre-half lays out the centre-forward with a right-hander. STUDDING the Achilles of your opponent when the ball passes everybody \\u2014 that's always a nice one. TACKLING your opponent very hard and then lifting him up with your hands under his armpits and pulling his hairs until he is screaming blue murder \\u2014 and you say to the referee \\u2018Well, I'm only trying to help him!\\u2019 THE oldest one in the book is waiting for a corner and treading on everyone's toes on a freezing January day. OR there's Gazza (Paul Gascoigne) when you grab him by the testicles and say \\u2018Can you speak in a bit lower voice?\\u2019 Jones, soccer's anti-hero, admits he is not one of the most loved men around but adds: \\u2018These sort things happen and it's no good saying they don't.\\u2019 But Jones, despite his outrageous statements, is passionate about the game. He said: \\u2018I didn't play soccer until I was 21. I was on the terraces until five years ago. \\u2018I know what I wanted. What my pals wanted and I put that on to the pitch. \\u2018You dish it out, you take it back. A clump does no harm.\\u2019 And he warned his opponents: \\u2018If you are going over the top on me you've got to put me out of the game. \\u2018Whether it's five minutes, ten minutes or next season, I'll be back.\\u2019 And Jones, in a frank interview on the video, describes why he clumped Liverpool star Steve McMahon in the opening minutes of the 1988 FA Cup against Liverpool at Wembley. And how McMahon tried to get his revenge when Vinny played at Anfield. RUSH WAR CRY! Ian aims to spark Reds revival Let's get it right RICHARD TANNER IAN RUSH makes a welcome return to action for crisis club Liverpool here tonight insisting: \\u2018We must win for our own good.\\u2019 Despite being 6-1 up from the home leg, boss Graeme Souness is demanding his players treat this European Cup Winners' Cup clash with Apollon Limassol as anything but a dead game. Their credibility and confidence has been stripped bare after three successive Premier League defeats and an embarrassing 4-4 Coca-Cola Cup draw with Chesterfield. The significance of tonight's game in the Tsirion Athletic Centre Stadium is not lost on Rush, who hit four of the first-leg goals to eclipse Roger Hunt's European club record. A Rush hat-trick tonight would take him past Hunt's all-time Liverpool scoring record of 286. But Rush, who has watched Liverpool concede 11 goals in the three games he's missed with a groin strain, insists: \\u2018I'm not interested in breaking records at the moment. The only important thing is that we play as a team and that we win. \\u2018It's a good game to get us going again, although I don't think the ground or conditions will be in our favour. \\u2018It would just be nice if we could get a goal lead for a change. That would make a big difference.\\u2019 Apart from Rush, Liverpool will be boosted by the return of Paul Stewart, who scored the other two goals in the first-leg win. But they will be without skipper Mark Wright, who picked up a \\u2018dead leg\\u2019 against Wimbledon on Saturday. TARGET RUSH is poised to pass Roger Hunt's all-time Liverpool scoring record. SOUNESS: Demands commitment ANGRY owners are planning to disrupt racing at Fontwell today by withdrawing several horses just before the start of races in protest of poor prize money. Imran quits PAKISTAN Test star Imran Khan yesterday announced his retirement from cricket. Khan, who skippered Pakistan to triumph in the World Cup final against England earlier this year, said: \\u2018I retire with the knowledge that I have no ambition left in the game.\\u2019 Close call for Cuban missiles! DAVID MOORE COLIN Jackson and Linford Christie sparkled as battling Britain finished second in the World Cup here in Havana last night. Jackson was a class apart from his opponents when winning the 110 metres hurdles, while team captain Christie \\u2014 who claims he is exhausted \\u2014 still managed second place in the 200 metres. Their superb displays ensured runners-up spot for the Brits behind Africa, with Europe third. Jackson jetted out of his blocks to leave the rest of his field for dead, crossing the line in 13.07 seconds. That shattered the competition record of 13.32, set by America's Greg Foster in 1981. Jackson, who failed in the Olympics, said: \\u2018I had to win, or the rest of the boys would have given me stick, particularly Linford.\\u2019 BROWNE IS ON A HIDING CHARLES FAWCUS EX-JOCKEY Dermot Browne could be kicked out of the racing game today \\u2014 without defending himself. Dermot has been summoned to appear before the Jockey Club this morning to face three charges relating to his brief career as a trainer and he's not expected to turn up. . \\u2018If he doesn't come, the  Disciplinary Committe then has to decide whether to go ahead with the inquiry in his  absence ,\\u2019 said the Jockey Club's Sue Williams. \\u2018Everything depends on whether he appears in the morning.\\u2019 The former Champion amateur rider was associated with top horses Browne's Gazette and The Mighty Mac, but everything turned sour when he set up as a trainer in 1990. Eventually his licence was taken away because he  didn't have enough horses. At one point he was quizzed by Jockey Club investigators and police detectives looking into the doping of Norwich, Bravefoot and Flying Diva, but no action was taken against him. Today Dermot is accused of \\u2018giving information to a bookmaker in return for money\\u2019 and he faces two other lesser charges relating to horses he trained. Browne has maintained his innocence all along, but he could be banned from all Britain's racetracks and a friend said: \\u2018They are just out to get him.\\u2019 Newmarket sees more cheerful action this afternoon with the clash of brilliant two-year-olds Lyric Fantasy and Sayyedati. Michael Roberts could ride either but sticks to Lyric Fantasy who became the first two-year-old filly to win the Nunthorpe at Yor  I salute the dogs of war The VINNY JONES story that has rocked the soccer world The men you'd want to have on your side FRANK WIECHULA TOUGH guy Vinny Jones last night saluted British soccer's legendary hard-men \\u2014 comparing them to heroes in war-time. Jones opens his heart in the controversial new video, Soccer's Hard Men, exclusively revealed in yesterday's Mirror Sport, which has shocked the football world. The Wimbledon midfielder pays tribute to big names like Graeme Souness, Nobby Stiles, Dave Mackay, Jack Charlton, Ron Harris, Norman Hunter, Steve McMahon, Bryan Robson, Tommy Smith and Peter Storey. Jones said: \\u2018If you look at a war, there was always the lad who carried the flag, or the emblem of a country. \\u2018If that man got shot then I think you'd bank on any of these lads in the video \\u2014 you wouldn't even need to turn round to see who was running with the flag. \\u2018With a lot of the hard men in football it's all down to their characters. They are not just aggressive on the field, they are probably aggressive in every walk of life. Pushed \\u2018These lads say to themselves \\u2018I'm not going to be pushed about, I'm going to have my piece.\\u2019 And when they go out on a football field they can do something about it. \\u2018I think a lot of supporters look for that because they all want to be leaders themselves \\u2014 they want to be the boss, they don't want to be the tea-boy.\\u2019 These are the men Jones highlights, and his comments: GRAEME SOUNESS (Spurs, Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Sampdoria, Rangers and Scotland \\u2014 1970-91): \\u2018I've got a lot of admiration for him because he was a very passionate player and he looked after other players as well. \\u2018If one of his mates got a whack and got hurt he'd go and sort it out for them. I'm not saying that's right, but he took it upon himself to say \\u2018You're not taking liberties with any of our lads.\\u2019 \\u2018He'd turn a 40-60 ball round the other way. Even now as a manager he's still very passionate about it and I look up to people like that.\\u2019 BILLY BREMNER:(Leeds, Hull, Doncaster and Scotland \\u2014 1959-81): \\u2018He was a hero at Elland Road a long time before I came into football. But having been a player there myself you can still feel the buzz of the bloke 15 years on. \\u2018I felt he never just led Leeds United FC. I think he led the people at work and at home as well. He inspired them and they looked up to him.\\u2019 NOBBY STILES (Manchester Utd, Middlesbrough, Preston and England \\u2014 1960-74): \\u2018He could have been a cartoon character. He was football's equivalent of Popeye \\u2014 he probably had a can of spinach before the game. \\u2018He was a weedy-looking little man with glasses and no teeth. But when he walked on the field you'd think it was Goliath coming on there.\\u2019 DAVE MACKAY (Spurs, Derby, Swindon and Scotland \\u2014 1958-71): \\u2018There's that famous picture of Mackay and Bremner, each showing total commitment and aggression. \\u2018It looked as though if you'd left them in a ring on their own, one of them would have had to drop down dead to end the fight. \\u2018For me Dave Mackay was more of a thoroughbred of the early times \\u2014 but I think he could have played successfully in today's football. \\u2018The only thing is he would get frustrated with the referees, because they just don't give you an inch. \\u2018I don't think they understand it \\u2014 it's not life and death, it's more than that.\\u2019 NORMAN HUNTER:(Leeds, Bristol City, Barnsley and England \\u2014 1961-82): \\u2018He had two other hard men with him he was able to rely on. \\u2018I think it was a big contest at Leeds, with Johnny Giles, Hunter and Bremner to be the toughest.\\u2019 JACK CHARLTON (Leeds and England 1952\\u201372): \\u2018I think he summed it up for me a couple of years ago when they questioned him being an Englishman in charge of the Irish team. \\u2018He turned round and said it was not about your race, or religion, it's about people \\u2014 life is about people. \\u2018When he was playing he strutted about like the rooster in the chicken run. You knew he was there, wherever you were on the pitch and you didn't want him coming in behind you trying to get the ball.\\u2019 TOMMY SMITH:(Liverpool, Swansea and England \\u2014 1962-1979): \\u2018The minute he got off the coach and walked into the changing-room people would go for cover. \\u2018He was one of these big ugly men, the big ferocious-looking bloke that if someone said to you he breathed fire, you'd believe them. \\u2018I've seen him at Liverpool in the players\\u2019 lounge. Even now he still looks a beast of a man.\\u2019 RON HARRIS:(Chelsea and Brentford- 1961\\u20131983): \\u2018People called him Chopper Harris, and Chopper was my first nickname when I went to Wimbledon \\u2014 before the crowd came up with Psycho for me. \\u2018But it doesn't matter what they call you \\u2014 with players like Harris the attraction was arrogance, terror, you name it \\u2014 and the people paid to see it, week in week out.\\u2019 Also featured in the video are STEVE McMAHON:(Everton, Villa, Liverpool, Manchester City and England \\u2014 1979onwards); BRYAN ROBSON:(West Bromwich, Manchester Utd and England \\u2014 1974-onwards) and PETER STOREY:(Arsenal, Fulham and England \\u2014 1965-1977). Jones finished off by saying: \\u2018The good thing about English football is that they don't roll about the pitch if they are not hurt. \\u2018I hope the Continental antics don't creep into our football because people like myself will be finished.\\u2019 FLASHPOINT THE famous day Spurs hard man Dave Mackay got to grips with Leeds legend Billy Bremner at White Hart Lane \\u2014 two Scottish firebrands coming face to face in the heat of battle McMAHON: Still playing STOREY: Red hot Gunner SMITH: Anfield iron man STILES: Like a little Goliath HUNTER: Hunted in a pack ROBSON: Still a United hero HARRIS: Original \\u2018Chopper\\u2019 CHARLTON: Like a rooster SOUNESS: Trouble-shooter On the ball RICHIE Woodhall, who defends his Commonwealth middleweight title against John Ashton in Telford tomorrow, plans a spring challenge for the European title at the Hawthorns. Woodhall, whose great grandfather George scored the winning goal for West Bromwich in the 1888 FA Cup final, has been adopted by the club. MICK'S A FALL GUY! MILLWALL player-manager Mick McCarthy blundered his side out of the Anglo-Italian Cup last night. Millwall drew 1-1 at Portsmouth, and the result meant Pompey secured a place against Italy's Serie B clubs in November. McCarthy's mistake came in the 76th minute when he allowed a long ball to go over his head, and Guy Whittingham nipped in for the equaliser. It spoilt a solid performance from McCarthy, and lost Millwall's lead. Portsmouth had, in fact, looked second best and the Lions' Dutch triallist Romano Sion was causing them problems. It was Sion who created Alex Rae's goal after 19 minutes. Brentford are also through thanks to on-loan keeper Gerry Peyton. And late goals by Simon Ratcliffe and Gary Blissett were enough to beat Oxford 2-0. But Peyton's heroics are unlikely to lead him to European glory. He is due to return to Everton in a fortnight. Luton were knocked out after drawing 1-1 with Bristol City. Wayne Allison's 55th-minute goal earned City their place in the next round, although Steve Claridge headed Luton level seven minutes later. DERBY beat Barnsley 2-1 with goals from Mark Pembridge and Richard Goulooze. Ged Taggart scored for Barnsley Taylor told: Wright is your man! NIGEL CLARKE ARSENAL manager George Graham last night urged Graham Taylor to pick Ian Wright for England. Graham said: \\u2018I can't pick the England team, but Ian would always be in my side.\\u2019 Graham gave this reminder to Graham after seeing his \\u00a32.5 million striker score in the 1-0 win over Manchester City at Highbury. It was Wright's sixth goal in 10 games. Wright's last appearance for his country was as a sub against Hungary in Budapest in May, and Graham promised: \\u2018If England pick him for the game against Norway next month he'll join the squad\\u2019. The last time Wright was called up he pulled out of the party even though he played for Arsenal. Graham added: \\u2018Ian would like to be included. But it's up to Graham Taylor now.\\u2019 Taylor saw the dark destroyer at his  devastating best as he grabbed the 18th minute winner. Graham was supported by Manchester City boss Peter Reid who said: \\u2018Wright's a quality player, the sort of striker to keep you on your toes.\\u2019 WRIGHT: In form Take a break KEVIN KEEGAN last night ordered Newcastle's teenage midfield star Lee Clark to take a break. Clark was eager to play in tonight's Anglo-Italian tie against Leicester at St James's Park but boss Keegan said: \\u2018Lee has run a million miles for us this season. He's only 19 and needs a rest for his own good.\\u2019 Clark, in action at least twice a week this season, admitted: \\u2018I'm disappointed because I don't feel tired \\u2014 nobody does when things are going so well.\\u2019 He is one of seven regulars missing tonight. Bjorn Kristensen, Alan Neilson, keeper Pavel Srnicek, Alan Thompson and club captain Brian Kilcline will all start. Coming soon THE tremendous response to news of the video \\u2018Soccer's Hard Men\\u2019 means the release date has been brought forward a week to October 12. The tape, from Video Vision, will be priced at \\u00a310.99, and will be available at most good video stores from that date. KO FOR MAC BID IAN GIBB COLIN McMillan's ambitious bid to be re-instated as WBO featherweight champion has been rejected. The WBO upheld Saturday's controversial decision at Olympia, when McMillan lost his title to Colombia's Ruben Palacio after sustaining a dislocated left shoulder in the eighth round. McMillan is still the mandatory challenger but WBO official Ed Levine said: \\u2018There is no reason to reverse the verdict since this was not a foul. Colin lost the fight.\\u2019 KO FOR MAC BID IAN GIBB COLIN McMillan's ambitious bid to be re-instated as WBO featherweight champion has been rejected. The WBO upheld Saturday's controversial decision at Olympia, when McMillan lost his title to Colombia's Ruben Palacio after sustaining a dislocated left shoulder in the eighth round. McMillan is still the mandatory challenger but WBO official Ed Levine said: \\u2018There is no reason to reverse the verdict since this was not a foul. Colin lost the fight.\\u2019 Preston sack Les LES Chapman got a belated birthday present yesterday \\u2014 the sack. The Preston North End boss celebrated his 44th birthday on Sunday but his fate had been sealed 24 hours earlier with the 2-0 home defeat against Hartlepool. The Second Division club ended Chapman's two-year Deepdale reign and installed Sam Allardyce as caretaker until a new man is appointed. Chapman, who hit the goal which earned Preston promotion six years ago, was the club's 18th manager since the war. Chief Executive Paul Agnew said: \\u2018It's very sad because Les is so popular with everyone. But it was given very full and serious consideration.\\u2019 Chapman said: \\u2018Obviously I'm sad but that's life and there is no animosity. As a manager you always know that one day it will happen. \\u2018Preston have been a great club and I'm sure they will be great again. Success will come.\\u2019 10 TRY-IFFIC SHAUN IS A CUP CRACKER Wigan ace shatters Swinton SWINTON 0 WIGAN 78 ALAN WEST TEN-TRY Shaun Edwards swept to the top of the Rugby League touchdown chart as Wigan piled on the agony for crisis club Swinton. Edwards' brilliant support play earned him four tries before the break and six in the second half to take his season's tally to 15 \\u2014 six ahead of Halifax centre Greg Austin. The Great Britain scrum-half became only the fourth player in history to score ten tries in a match \\u2014 equalling team-mate Martin Offiah's club record set against Leeds in the Premiership semi-final last May. Wigan's victory was also a record defeat for Swinton \\u2014 beating the 76-3 thrashing by Huddersfield in 1946. And Edwards' ten-try haul is only one less than the Rugby League record set by George West for Hull KR against Brookland in 1905. The only blot for scintillating Wigan was that Offiah handed Great Britain coach Mal Reilly a World Cup scare after limping off with damaged knee tendons. Offiah, back in action against Widnes last Friday after missing two matches with hamstring trouble, was carried off early in the second half after pulling up in agony. Edwards was handed his tenth try on a plate by Dean Bell with Wigan clinching a semi- final home tie against Oldham next Tuesday. The Lancashire Cup is the only trophy to elude coach John Monie in his three-year reign though they hardly needed to break sweat against helpless Swinton with Frano Botica booting 11 goals from 15 attempts. Second Division strugglers Swinton, battling for survival with crippling cash problems, had only the consolation of a 3,501 gate at their new Bury home. Edwards said: \\u2018The most I had ever scored before for Wigan was four tries \\u2014 I never dreamt I'd score ten. Ability \\u2018My job is to back up the man with the ball and I always try to do that to the best of my ability. I learned a lot from Ellery Hanley when he was at Wigan. \\u2018When I reached eight tries I realised I was in with a chance of records and the lads helped me as best they could.\\u2019 KING EDWARDS SHAUN Edward was too hot for Swinton last night \\u2014 scoring a record-equalling ten tries. FERGIE'S OWN GOAL MATT HUGHES MANCHESTER UNITED manager Alex Ferguson will be \\u2018haunted for years\\u2019 by the sale of striker Mark Robins to Norwich. That is the grim prediction of former United boss Tommy Docherty who believes Ferguson has scored a spectacular own goal by allowing Robins to leave Old Trafford. Robins has so far scored seven goals after Ferguson sold him to Norwich for a cut-price \\u00a3800,000 on the eve of the season. Docherty, who reckons that is a real blunder, made his feelings known when he spoke at a soccer club dinner in Norfolk. \\u2018I couldn't believe it when I heard Fergie was going to sell Robins,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018And I was even more astounded when I heard what Norwich were going to pay for him. \\u2018United gave him away and Mike Walker must have thought it was his lucky day. \\u2018Fergie has made a big mistake and I'm sure the decision will haunt him for years to come.\\u2019 ROBINS: Bargain DUEL! AUSTRALIA'S Rugby League kings, the Brisbane Broncos, threw down a dramatic challenge to record-breaking Wigan last night, demanding: \\u2018Play us to decide the best team in the world.\\u2019 The Broncos are happy to take on John Monie's Best of British away from home \\u2014 they want the showdown at Wigan's Central Park the weekend after the World Cup final between Australia and Great Britain on October 24. Brisbane would already have eight players in England as part of the Aussie World Cup squad \\u2014 and the rest could soon follow. MONIE: Wigan boss HULL HUNT HULL are the latest club to show an interest in Leeds forgotten man John Gallagher. The Humbersiders already have a top kicker in Paul Eastwood but think they can use the pace of Gallagher in their three-quarter line. Leeds yesterday signed Hunslet scrum-half James Lowes. WE CAN LIFT CUP MATT HUGHES ROLAND NILSSON, Sheffield Wednesday's Swedish full-back, last night backed them to land the UEFA Cup \\u2014 in the club's first European excursion since 1963. Nilsson discounts the fact that Wednesday, certain to complete their first-round demolition of Spora Luxembourg tomorrow, have not done battle on Continental soil for 29 years. The 28-year-old defender knows the route to glory, having won the UEFA Cup with IFK Gothenburg in 1987. \\u2018We have the experience to win the trophy first time out,\\u2019 he said, even though Wednesday will face much sterner tests than the 8-1 first-leg rout of Spora. \\u2018In Trevor, Chris Waddle, Viv Anderson, Chris Woods and myself we have players who've appeared in Europe for other clubs. \\u2018And many of those who haven't done that are internationals, anyway \\u2014 like David Hirst, Carlton Palmer, John Sheridan, Nigel Worthington and Danny Wilson.\\u2019 Nilsson added: \\u2018With a little luck I'm sure we can go all the way. Our style is suited to European competition. \\u2018We like to play the ball around like the Continentals, but we still work as hard as any team in England.\\u2019 NILSSON: Confident Gord help us says Strachan JOHN EDWARDS GORDON STRACHAN last night appealed for strong refereeing to give Leeds a fighting chance of creating European Cup history. The champions face the awesome job of wiping out a three-goal deficit against their German counterparts Stuttgart at Elland Road tonight. Strachan believes they can do it \\u2014 provided dangerman Lee Chapman gets proper protection against Stuttgart's strong-arm tactics. The veteran of European campaigns with Aberdeen and Manchester United revealed his concern at the rough stuff dished out to prolific marksman Chapman in the first leg a fortnight ago. Chapman became a target man in more ways than one as the Germans singled him out for a buffeting that went unpunished by Swedish referee Rune Larsson. Alarmed Stuttgart coach Christophe Daum had named Chapman as his side's biggest worry after the pre-season Makita tournament at Elland Road, saying: \\u2018He is so dangerous when the ball is played into him in the air, and I don't think we are able to cope with that.\\u2019 Strachan was alarmed at the way the German defence manhandled the 33-year-old front-runner and got away with it. And he pleaded for a firmer approach from tonight's referee, Denmark's Kim Milton Nielsen. \\u2018Don't get me wrong \\u2014 we're not asking for any favours from the referee,\\u2019 said the inspirational Leeds midfielder. \\u2018It's up to us to overturn the deficit without any outside help. \\u2018But after what went on in the first leg, I hope we get a referee who will be strong enough to stamp out any foul play. \\u2018We knew they were worried about Chappy's aerial ability, and it showed in the way they dealt with him. \\u2018There were arms everywhere, pulling him back and tugging at his shirt, and they got away with it just about every time.\\u2019 Strachan feels Leeds are running into form at just the right time for the most daunting task of manager Howard Wilkinson's four-year reign. An impressive 2-0 win over Everton left the watching Germans in no doubt that Leeds are in the mood to become the first British team to win a European tie from 3-0 down. And Strachan enthused: \\u2018We're getting back to something like our old form, and that's encouraging. \\u2018It's a dream to stick four goals past the German champions and win the tie, but it can be a reality as well. We've simply got to stick to our pattern.\\u2019 CHAPMAN: Dangerman HEY REF! LEEDS United's Gordon Strachan hopes the referee takes a firmer approach against Stuttgart's tactics in tonight's second leg at Elland Road. RED AND BURIED PENALTY HORROR AS UNITED ARE TORPEDOED Torpedo Moscow 0, Man Utd 0 (Agg 0-0, Moscow won 4-3 on pens) KEN LAWRENCE ALEX FERGUSON'S shell-shocked troops last night trudged home from Russia after failing in a dramatic penalty shoot-out. Manchester United looked like they had forced themselves into the second round of the UEFA Cup when they went two goals ahead after four spot kicks when Paul Ince and Denis Irwin buried their chances. But the Russians of Torpedo Moscow hit back when Igor Chuganov beat Peter Schmeichel, who two years ago had led his former club Brondby to penalty glory in the same stadium. Steve Bruce and Brian McClair both missed their chances and while come-back skipper Bryan Robson took the scores to 3-3 after five kicks each, Gary Pallister became the man forced to hold his head in anguish. Before he stepped up for the most nerve-shattering moment of his career Guennady Grishin had kept his nerve to fire the Russians into a 4-3 advantage. Engulfed England defender Pallister was then handed the responsibility of keeping United in continental competition but, just as they had failed in a penalty shoot-out against Videoton in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, so they were again to be engulfed in misery. Pallister tried to keep his shot low and hard but Torpedo captain Alex Podshivalov pounced on the ball to send his team mates wild with joy and leave Ferguson's battling side shaking their heads in grief. Earlier, with just seconds remaining of normal time, Mark Hughes had been sent off for a second bookable offence and his team mates then produced a magnificent display of courageous football to keep themselves in this tie. And it seemed Fergie's ten man heroes had squeezed out a momentous victory until the soccer fates suddenly stabbed them in the back in the pouring rain of Moscow. They had already been unlucky with just five minutes remaining in normal time, when Neil Webb's shot cannoned back off the foot of the post. Earlier Robson's dramatic arrival \\u2014 five months after his last competitive encounter \\u2014 had an immediate effect on United's performance. Suddenly Webb looked more relaxed and Ince could drive forward with more confidence. Just after replacing the injured Danny Wallace in the 37th minute, Robson met a cross from 18-year-old Ryan Giggs but his fierce shot from 14 yards was brilliantly turned away by Podshivalov. Bruce was the first United man to be cautioned and later McClair and Hughes followed him, but Torpedo's histrionic reaction to the visitors' tackling rarely impressed referee Jan Dangaard. That was lucky for the Manchester side as the Danish official turned down no less than four strident claims for penalties. Mike Phelan looked like he may have discovered a passage into the second round with a fierce drive which spun off a defender with the goalkeeper stranded. Then Hughes, for so long dogged by the determined attentions of marker Guennady Fillimonov, suddenly shook himself into space before blasting from the edge of the box but Podshivalov reacted superbly. Schmeichel excelled himself as Torpedo's blond danger man Talalayev suddenly found himself 14 yards from goal but his cannon shot was miraculously pushed away by the goalkeeper. Danger Seconds later Talalayev found himself in another inviting position but this time sent the ball skywards and out of danger. Then with only seconds remaining of normal time Hughes was given his marching orders for a foul on his tormentor Fillimonov. The Welshman kicked the ball away and referee Dangaard dismissed him for a second bookable offence. But while United were now reduced to ten men during that last desperate half hour of extra time they survived magnificently to force themselves into the dramatic penalty spot finale in the rain. DOWN'N OUT POOR Mark Hughes slips up as he tries a shot in Moscow \\u2014 and soon he had fallen from grace completely.

LIMASSOL 1 LIVERPOOL 2 Agg: A.Limassol 2, Liverpool 8 RICHARD TANNER FIERY Paul Stewart saw red here last night as Liverpool ran into a Cup-Winners Cup storm. Stewart was sent off 18 minutes from the end of a niggly clash for foolishly slapping Apollon keeper Michalis Christophi across the head as he picked himself up from an innocent penalty-area collision. Stewart could argue that it was little more than a playful cuff and Christophi certainly made a real meal of it by falling dramatically to the ground clutching his face. A linesman called over referee Loris Stasoggia \\u2014 and the Italian official had little choice but to dismiss Stewart. As he walked disconsolately away the hotheaded Cypriot crowd threw several missiles on to the running track \\u2014 but fortunately none reached the Liverpool bench. Stewart's dismissal \\u2014 Liverpool's first in Europe since Kenny Dalglish was given his marching orders against Benfica eight years ago \\u2014 took the gloss off the Merseyside club's first away win in any competition since January 18. Goals from Rush and rookie Don Hutchison gave them victory after Yugoslav international Milenko Spoliaric had given the Cypriots a shock lead. But Stewart will now miss both legs of the second round \\u2014 and possibly a third game \\u2014 with his dismissal likely to be judged as violent conduct. Liverpool may have been five goals up from the first leg, but this was never going to be an easy game in 70-degree heat and on a typically bumpy Mediterranean pitch. Liverpool, missing seven players through injury and ineligibility, survived some anxious moments in the first half. But Liverpool appeared to have weathered the storm and were heading for their first clean sheet since their Cup final win in May when Spoliaric crashed home a left-foot drive on the hour. But Ian Rush, Liverpool's most experienced European campaigner, quickly spared their blushes two minutes later, turning well inside the box to drill home a low shot from Hutchison's pass. Hutchison, the kid Dalglish signed from Hartlepool nearly two years ago, marked his European debut with the winner in the 69th minute when he sent a neat chip over the keeper after being fed by Steve McManaman. Souness had no complaints about Stewart's dismissal, saying: \\u2018He was foolish. He was wrong to get involved as he did. \\u2018Paul raised his hand and if you do that you deserve to go.\\u2019 SHAME OF VINNY He's a mosquito brain\\u2026talking with diarrhoea in his mouth HARRY HARRIS VINNY JONES was last night subjected to an astonishing attack by Wimbledon owner and father-figure Sam Hammam over his involvement in a shock video nasty. Jones was also slammed by the FA and the PFA over the controversial film glorifying the dirty tricks in the game. But the most vicious attack came from Hammam. The Dons supremo, who once said he wanted Jones to be his manager, labelled him a \\u2018stupid, mosquito brain, who talks with diarrhoea in his mouth.\\u2019 Hammam is disgusted after viewing the shock 78-minute film which players' union leader Gordon Taylor wants banned. It will surely lead to at least a one-match FA suspension for the player. Hammam said: \\u2018Vinny is like an adopted son to me and I'm very disappointed. He has let himself down badly. \\u2018What he has said is so stupid. He must be a mosquito brain to say that. \\u2018It's like Madonna showing her bum and her boobs to get people to buy her product. \\u2018He hasn't done anyone any favours and I'll be talking to him about it. On that video he is talking with diarrhoea in his mouth.\\u2019 In the video \\u2018Soccer's Hard Men\\u2019 Jones talks about players' illegal use of the elbow, the gouging of eyes, punching, pulling hairs under the armpits and deliberately studding opponents legs when the ball has gone. The FA are appalled by Jones' contribution and are likely to charge him with misconduct. Taylor called for a ban on the video and said: \\u2018Something like this that glorifies cheating brings the game into open disrepute.\\u2019 Also upset were managers Terry Venables of Tottenham and Brian Clough of Nottingham Forest, who say they will be taking legal action. In the video Jones is, in the main, observing rather than advocating the ruthless antics of the hard men. But there is one inflammatory comment that has guaranteed him an FA rap. He says: \\u2018If you're going to go over the top on me you've got to put me out of the game because I'll be coming back for you.\\u2019 How MIRROR SPORT broke the story yesterday FERGIE FLOPS OUT IN DRAMA KEN LAWRENCE ALEX FERGUSON last night insisted his men had been mugged in Moscow following Manchester United's disastrous UEFA Cup exit.

He said: \\u2018The pressure on people, forced to take penalties in this situation, is terrible \\u2014 no one can envy anybody that task. \\u2018In the end, however, Torpedo stole the game from us despite my players running themselves into the ground. \\u2018The fact that we failed to reach the second round is a blow in many ways and I am so disappointed for everybody.\\u2019 Fergie offered no real argument on the dismissal of Hughes, saying: \\u2018The referee was a bit fussy but when you take the ball away as Mark did, when already booked, then it's automatic that you go.\\u2019 HUGHES: Red card FERGIE'S FLOPS United out in drama KEN LAWRENCE ALEX FERGUSON last night insisted his men had been mugged in Moscow following Manchester United's disastrous UEFA Cup exit.

Picture: ALBERT COOPER TYSON The night his world caved in \\u2018I'VE BEEN BORED WITH BOXING FOR YEARS. I MAY NEVER FIGHT AGAIN\\u2019 PRISONER: 922335 NIGEL CLARKE MIKE TYSON, the most dangerous fighting man on earth, has admitted he may never box again. Incarcerated in his prison hell while he serves a six-year sentence for rape, the one time world heavyweight champ admits he's bored with the fight game. Tyson, the man who rose from the ghettos of New York to the pinnacle of boxing success, had his world destroyed when he was judged guilty of violating a beauty queen whom he was convicted of luring to his room and raping. But, cooped up in his 12 by 10 feet prison cell in the Indiana Youth Centre, Tyson spoke about his sentence and his incarceration that eats at him like a malignant disease. Reputations For such a violent man Tyson is surprisingly sensitive. He lisps, his handshake is effeminate, a loose-wristed attempt at a greeting that camouflages the evil within him. As a jailbird he knows he is no different to the cons he has to live with night and day \\u2014 reputations mean nothing here. He can turn his head away from the screams, the pleas, the heart-rending shouts that split the night air \\u2014 suffering human beings screeching their injustice at the outside world. It is a world he has lived with before. As a child as young as 12, he was instituted into corrective centres, made to pay the price of his adolescent  indiscretions . So jail is not new to him, in those days it was an accepted way of life. But as the most famous boxer in the modern history of the game, Tyson found himself back in an environment he hoped he had turned his back on for ever. Now he says: \\u2018When the chips drop, when I get out, I may not even want to box again. \\u2018I've been bored with boxing  for almost four years. I live day by day, you know what I mean? \\u2018On my first night in prison again it wasn't realistic. Those cells are horrible. You never forget them as long as you live.\\u2019 Tyson's past had come back eerily to haunt him \\u2014 this time not in street violence but in the way Desiree Washington, a competitor in the Miss America Pageant accused him of the crimes that were to see the world heavyweight champion's status reduced to that of a common criminal. Tyson recalls vividly his night of destiny. \\u2018I called her, and she said she was tired or something. I told her not to worry about it. \\u2018I said \\u2018just comb your hair and put water on your face.\\u2019 \\u2018She came in the car\\u2026we kissed and we were making out. \\u2018We were fooling around\\u2026then we drove right around the corner to my hotel room. \\u2018I closed the door and we sat on the bed. \\u2018She just sat on my bed and she was talking. We started kissing, and she started pulling off her clothes. \\u2018She was getting hot, she was getting aggressive. We had sex \\u2014 and after it was over I invited her to stay. \\u2018I was tired and I had to leave at approximately five \\u2014 in about two hours. She also had to get up around five \\u2014 we both had schedules. \\u2018She didn't want to go \\u2014 but she wanted me to walk her downstairs. I didn't want to walk her. I said sorry, I'm tired. \\u2018Maybe I should have just walked her downstairs or something. \\u2018The next week I heard about this.\\u2019 When it's all over Tyson wants to melt back into the crowd. He adds: \\u2018I don't like living like a big star \\u2014 where everyone has the potential to hurt you or want something from you. \\u2018I don't like that sort of life because I'm just a normal person \\u2014 extremely normal\\u2026 HOW the other half lives \\u2014 once Mike Tyson was a big star with all the luxury trappings of fame and fortune\\u2026now this is home, a 12 by 10 prison cell in Indiana PRIME TIME \\u2014 Mike Tyson in his heyday, mean, moody, and ready to demolish another world title opponent. Boks new race row ALAN WEST SOUTH AFRICA'S under-fire coach John Williams refused to give in to pressure as the row over the Springboks\\u2019 rugby tour of France deepened last night. Williams maintained he has no intention of bowing to pressure from the French government by including a black player in their all-white touring party. French sports minister Frederique Bredin is boycotting the Springboks' opening match in Bordeaux on Saturday because of the make-up of the squad. Williams blasted: \\u2018No new player is going to join us. The minister is going to miss a good match.\\u2019 Team manager Abie Malan also defended the South African decision to bring only white players. He said: \\u2018The selection committee is multi-racial and we came with the 30 best players we could pick. \\u2018There will not be a black player in the team just for the sake of it \\u2014 our team is picked solely on merit.\\u2019 BLISTERED! Brave Beefy's in agony on walk of hell But there's still time for fun CHRISTINE GARBUTT IAN BOTHAM shouted in pain yesterday as walked down the hills to Dartmouth. On the sixth day of his latest charity walk, the mighty Botham's legs were killing him. \\u2018This has been the most savage start of any of the walks I've done,\\u2019 panted Beefy, as he walked backwards downhill to relieve the strain in his calves. \\u2018It's beautiful scenery, but the hills of Cornwall and Devon are torture.\\u2019 As the Big Man marched into Dartmouth at his amazingly fast pace of 4.3 miles an hour, the hundreds lining the roadside would have no idea of the agony he was in \\u2014 nor would Botham dream of telling them. To him pain is just another challenge. The crowds waved and cheered him on, the boats bobbing up and down in the estuary. And money poured into the coffers. Through sponsorship and money collected by the roadside, more than \\u00a340,000 has already been raised for leukaemia research. Out of Dartmouth and up the Alp-like hills again towards Paignton, king-of-the-road Beefy started running. \\u2018Come on,\\u2019 he ordered his troops. \\u2018Pain is fun.\\u2019 Gruelling Then, calling for his \\u2018Orangeand\\u2019, known to the faithful as orange and tequila, Botham raced ahead. Chris Lander, the Daily Mirror's cricket writer and the only man to have marched every step of the way with Beefy on his walks, is amazed at how Ian carries on the torturous pace. \\u2018It's gruelling,\\u2019 says Lander, 51. \\u2018But Ian keeps us all going by his sheer determination. Yet I've never heard him cry out in pain before.\\u2019 Botham has been in pain since the fourth day of this 546-mile hike from Land's End to Margate, with a deep-seated blister on his achilles tendon. \\u2018It's the first time I've ever been able to persuade Beefy to stop for treatment,\\u2019 says Dave \\u2018Rooster\\u2019Roberts, the new England cricket team physio who is looking after the walkers. \\u2018I patched him up in record time by the roadside. It was a bit like a pit stop in a Grand Prix race.\\u2019 Roberts also revealed that Ian's knees are swollen, and a large blister is developing under his big toe. \\u2018I wouldn't be in his shoes,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018Not with 16 days to go. That man is a hero.\\u2019 Beefy is a hero to the thousands that turn out to see him through rain and shine as he marches down the south coast. An elderly lady couldn't stop crying as the Big Man paced through her small Devonshire village. \\u2018I had to see him. I had to see him and wave him on,\\u2019 she sobbed, opening the contents of her purse into the collector's tin. \\u2018I nursed my husband for five years with leukaemia. He died last week. Please God the money raised will help find a cure.\\u2019 A mobile home, known as the Tardis, goes in front of the walkers to offer food and drink at strategic places. Ian rarely eats, preferring chocolate milk shakes, water, and his favourite tipple when pain dictates. Ian's mother-in-law, Mrs Jan Waller, is in charge of catering for the four walkers and 17 back-up crew. Proud A five-year-old boy called in, asking Mrs. Waller for a drink. He'd managed to walk a mile behind Botham and was very proud of himself. But his mother was crying. \\u2018Why are you crying?\\u2019 asked the kid. The mother wiped her eyes and, when the lad was out of earshot, she revealed her son was a victim of the disease. \\u2018It's two years now and you would never guess,\\u2019 she admitted. \\u2018Without funds being raised he wouldn't have stood a chance. Now we are hoping he will fully recover.\\u2019 That is all Botham wants to hear. He's vowed to carry on walking \\u2018until we've licked the disease.\\u2019 Yet the toll on his 36-year-old body is beginning to show. His wife Kathy, who organised the walk, admits that Ian goes to hell and back on the walks. \\u2018But he won't admit it,\\u2019 she says. \\u2018And when I see him hobbling in at night, I am very proud of him.\\u2019 Kids gather at the end of each day, hoping Ian will sign their autograph books and cricket bats. Yet that is one hurdle their hero can't manage. His fingers are too swollen to hold a pen. After a long, hot soak, and wearing flip-flops to get the air to his tired feet, Beefy is back in action at the hotel, urging on his troops to make merry. \\u2018We need fun,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018To keep us going.\\u2019 Part of the fun yesterday was when Lander doused the walking hero with a bucket of sea water. Botham's pals were in stitches, but Lander was warned: \\u2018You'll go in the sea or an appropriate river before we get to Margate.\\u2019 Yesterday Botham marched along the Paignton seafront clocking the incredible time of six hours and 12 minutes over the 26.4 miles. He has backed himself at 16-1 to complete the marathon haul to Margate in 130 hours, and he is on course to win. Today he will set off from Paignton to Topsham, a 27.7-mile walk that will mean pounding the roads non-stop for more than eight hours. It could be Botham's biggest challenge so far \\u2014 the hills are crippling. Bird in the hand TEST umpire Dickie Bird joins Ian Botham in Devon on his charity walk. It's a great laugh for Dickie but Beefy's in agony. FEET FIRST IT'S medication time for Ian Botham, under the skilful hands of Dave Roberts, the new physio to the England cricket team. Ian's knees are swollen and a large blister is developing under his big toe. But he'll be striding on. DELAY FOR MICK JIM O'BRIEN ENGLAND flanker Micky Skinner has pulled out of his come-back for Blackheath on Saturday to allow his injured knee more time to heal. Skinner, who moved back to Blackheath from Harlequins at the end of last season, underwent surgery in the summer and had hoped to play against Bath at the weekend. But Blackheath administrator Alun Davies said: \\u2018The knee is coming on fine but it needs at least another couple of weeks rehabilitation. \\u2018We don't want to rush Mick because it's a long season and we need him for the long haul. A setback now would be stupid.\\u2019 SKINNER: Delay Warwick track bid DEREK Warwick is poised to make a return to Grand Prix racing with the Milton Keynes-based Footwork Mugen-Honda team next season. Warwick, 38, and a veteran of 131 Grands Prix, won the world sportscar championship with Peugeot this year and has been itching for a chance to get back in the big time of Formula One. Yesterday he was testing with the team in Estoril where he said: \\u2018There is nothing I would like better than to be back in Grand Prix racing.\\u2019 Oh, Ossie OSSIE Ardiles, West Bromwich Albion's manager, could face an FA rap following the defeat at Stoke. Ardiles was critical of the performance of referee Edward Parker, who booked eight players. He then made it clear to the FA that he was unhappy with Parker's handling of the game. AZZA KEEPS JOB ALAN WEST MOHAMMED Azharuddin will lead India on their cricket tour of Zimbabwe  and South Africa beginning next month. The former Derbyshire batsman has been retained as skipper despite winning only one of 12 Tests. \\u2018No other name was considered,\\u2019 said chief selector G.R. Vishwanath. \\u2018We see in Azharuddin leadership qualities.\\u2019 The rest of India's squad will be named today. AZHARUDDIN Vegas hosts finals draw MATT HUGHES CAESARS Palace in Las Vegas is set to host the draw for the 1994 World Cup finals. FIFA has yet to announce the venue for December 19, 1993. But bosses at the famous casino, which has staged some of boxing's greatest world title fights, are confident they've scooped the big prize. \\u2018Next to the matches itself, the draw is the single biggest event in the World Cup,\\u2019 said Steve Sampson, vice president of World Cup USA 1994. \\u2018For an hour and a half that Sunday, the eyes of the world will be on Las Vegas.\\u2019 Sampson added that the gambling city's ability to put on major events and Caesars' commitment to the World Cup made it a logical choice over Orlando and Phoenix, the two other cities that had hoped to win. The draw, which will divide the 24 qualifiers into groups and determine the nine venues, is expected to draw a worldwide TV audience of more than one billion and be attended by 10,000 dignitaries, soccer officials and media personnel. Stemp stumped RICHARD Stemp, the Worcestershire bowler, will appear before a Test and County Cricket Board disciplinary committee next Tuesday following a routine drug test. Worcestershire secretary Mike Vockins said: \\u2018Richard fully expects to satisfy the hearing.\\u2019 Stemp, a 24-year-old spinner, took 28 first-class wickets for Worcester this summer. Top clubs chasing Africans HARRY HARRIS ENGLISH football is bracing itself for an invasion of South African soccer talent. Aston Villa, Everton, Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United, West Ham and Millwall have made the first moves to look at one of the largest untapped areas of players in world football. Since FIFA accepted South Africa back on to the international stage their top players have become available for transfer at cheap prices. Three of the best young black players in South Africa have been earmarked for extensive trials in England by Paul Gascoigne's advisor Mel Stein. Sizwe Motaung, Philemon Masinga and Sean Donnelly are all tipped for the Premier League. Midfielder Donnelly is interesting Villa boss Ron Atkinson while Masinga has caught the attention of Everton and Sheffield Wednesday. International Motaung has already been to Hillsborough and Bramall Lane and will have trials with West Ham and Millwall. Stein said: \\u2018We've already seen the latest coming from Africa in the shape of Pele from Ghana at Olympic Marseille and Ndlovu from Zimbabwe at Coventry. \\u2018Transfer fees and salaries are far more modest and reasonable then the UK and Europe and the potential is endless. There are many fine players there.\\u2019 STEIN: Talent Wigan get in a fix MARTIN RICHARDS WIGAN are wanted for a \\u2018double whammy\\u2019 Down Under next February \\u2014 but it could cause a fixture pile-up at a crucial stage of the season. Aussie RL chiefs have done a U-turn after originally backing a plan for the Brisbane Broncos to take on John Monie's Wigan for the World Club crown at Central Park on October 31, a week after the World Cup final. But the Aussies have now decided that the Central Park clash might divert players' minds from the build-up to the final, with eight of the Broncos' side in the Kangaroos squad. Now Wigan are being asked to defend their world crown in Brisbane next February. And it's being pencilled in for the weekend after Wigan are due to defend their world sevens title in Sydney on February 5-7. But that's the scheduled weekend for the second round of the Challenge Cup. MONIE: Defence BLUES BOTHER HUGH JAMIESON TERRY COOPER yesterday accused Cambridge of a time-wasting campaign as Birmingham qualified for the international stage of the Anglo-Italian Cup. Birmingham, needing a point from their final group match, scrambled a 3-3 draw, but not before Blues boss Cooper had grabbed the ball on the touchline from striker Devon White as Cambridge's tactics angered the former England star. CELTIC JOY Celtic 3, Cologne 0 CELTIC scored twice in two minutes in the first-half to wipe out Cologne's 2-0 lead from the first-leg of this UEFA Cup-tie. Paul McStay grabbed the first goal with a first-time shot after keeper Bodo Illgner had punched at Tommy Boyd's shot. Then midfielder John Collins hit an unstoppable 20-yarder into a top corner. Celtic pressed forward \\u2014 and Collins made it a memorable night for them when he shot the third goal eleven minutes from time. MAMA MIA Hoult's lesson pasta joke Newcastle 4, Leicester 0 COLIN DIBALL RUSSELL HOULT conceded the first goals of his professional career and was lucky not to be sent off as Leicester crashed out of the Anglo Italian Cup. The 19-year-old keeper had kept a clean sheet in his four previous games but got a rude awakening against a Newcastle side that can do no wrong. Hoult got a harsh taste of reality as Kevin Keegan's side took their unbeaten run to 13 games and clinched a place in the later stages. Hoult escaped with a caution after bringing down old boy David Kelly on a diagonal run inside the area. Referee, Michael Peck, gave the youngster the benefit of the doubt but Hoult was still punished when Mick Quinn rapped in the penalty to give Newcastle an uncatchable two goal half-time lead. Leicester only needed a draw to make progress in the Cup. But their chances effectively evaporated after only nine minutes. Kevin Brock, like Quinn a target for Portsmouth boss Jim Smith, slid the ball in from 14 yards to impress watching scouts. And things got no better for City in the second half when first Kevin Sheedy hammered in a 57th minute free-kick and then Quinn doubled his tally for the night seven minutes from time with a delightful chip. To rub it in Keegan rested seven of his side and finished the game with only two first team regulars. Leicester's Geordie boss Brian Little, in contrast, paraded his strongest side but they rarely threatened Newcastle. Their best effort came after 66 minutes when a Gary Mills volley was saved by Czech Pavel Srnicek at the second attempt. For the rest the visitors were simply played out of it \\u2014 and they could have few complaints. LITTLE: Exit GET HAWAY: David Kelly takes on his former club City spy Rico MANCHESTER City boss Peter Reid was at Celtic Park last night spying on Cologne ace Rico Steinmann. Midfielder Steinmann, capped 23 times by East Germany before re-unification has already told Cologne he wants a move and would cost around \\u00a3800,000. City have gone four games without a goal and Reid wants to halt the slide. ANDY'S AGONY ANDY Gregory's hopes of a comeback with Leeds in tomorrow night's Stones Bitter championship clash with Warrington have been scrapped. The Great Britain scrum-half, who had a minor knee operation recently, has not yet been given the go-ahead by the specialist. Leeds could give a debut to new signing Jamie Lowes. WHIP-ROUND BRADFORD City signed Barnsley defender Colin Hoyle yesterday after the directors dipped into their pockets to meet a \\u00a330,000 fee. Chairman David Simpson, who appealed to supporters to help the club raise the money, said: \\u2018We had some reaction. But we had to move quickly otherwise Colin would have gone back to Barnsley because his loan spell was over.\\u2019 Right over the top CHELSEA legend Ron Harris last night branded Vinny Jones a coward and told him: \\u2018The hard men of yesteryear would have eaten you for breakfast!\\u2019 Chopper, now a successful racing greyhound breeder, said: \\u2018It just sums up what a bloody idiot he is to have made a video nasty like that. \\u2018Every club years ago had a tough-tackling defender in their side but they didn't resort to the tactics he is talking about. \\u2018I might have kicked a few people in my time, and some would say I got away with it for twenty years. But I never grabbed anyone by the goolies. \\u2018Players who whack someone when the play is up the other end of the field are cowards. \\u2018I would like to have seen how brave he is with players like Ron Yates and Norman Hunter about. \\u2018To my mind he's slow and lacks one big asset that every professional footballer needs \\u2014 ability.\\u2019 HARRIS: Scorn YOU'RE A PLONKER VINNY! TOMMY SMITH PUTS THE BOOT INTO PSYCHO \\u2018Video was an insult\\u2019 \\u2018Ban him for two years\\u2019 RICHARD TANNER/TOMMY SMITH ANGRY Tommy Smith last night branded Vinny Jones' controversial new video \\u2018a sick publicity stunt.\\u2019 Liverpool's legendary Iron Man believes the FA should come down on Jones like a ton of bricks for his shameful outbursts that glorify cheating and thuggery. Jones was yesterday charged with bringing the game into disrepute for boasting about his sickening and cynical philosophy towards the game on the tape titled \\u2018Soccer's Hard Men.\\u2019 Smith, one of the tough nuts that Jones salutes, reckons Wimbledon's \\u2018Psycho\\u2019 has gone well over the top on his vulgar video nasty. He stormed: \\u2018The FA should suspend him for a couple of years and if they can't ban the video then they should fine him every penny he makes out of it. \\u2018I'm insulted that he's even talking about me on the tape \\u2014 and I'm sure the other players he's mentioned feel the same. \\u2018I was asked to do a promotional picture with him for the video launch, but I refused. I didn't want anything to do with him or the tape. Image \\u2018I wouldn't mind if it was someone I respected as a player and a hard-man. But in my book he simply can't play. \\u2018As for his hard-man image, all I'll say is that he wouldn't have lasted five minutes in my day. \\u2018The fact he's making a living in the game now is a sad reflection on the lack of true quality in football at the moment. \\u2018Vinny should count himself very, very lucky to have made a lot of money out of football without having any ability. \\u2018It amazes me he should now want to kill the goose that has laid him the golden egg. \\u2018He's moved from Wimbledon to Leeds, Sheffield United, Chelsea and back to the Dons for around \\u00a33million. And yet 15 or 20 years ago he would still be playing non-League stuff and carrying a hod around for a living. \\u2018The only reason so many clubs have signed him must be because he's a good motivator. \\u2018But he's kicked football in the teeth with this tape. It's just a cynical publicity campaign to promote himself and sell more copies of the video. \\u2018It insults the great players he mentions from a by-gone age, and doesn't do Vinny, his club or football in general any credit at all. No wonder his chairman, Sam Hammam, has hit the roof and called him a mosquito brain. \\u2018It isn't jealousy on my part because at least I could kick a ball straight. \\u2018You don't play 600odd games for Liverpool and help them win European trophies, League championships and FA Cups if you can't play a bit. \\u2018Vinny's not fit to lace the boots of the players he talks about on the tape. They may have been hard but they could all play a bit as well. \\u2018He couldn't have lived with people like Billy Bremner, Johnny Giles, Norman Hunter, Dave Mackay, Ron Harris and Nobby Stiles. He doesn't know anything about hard men. \\u2018He's not crafty enough, he hasn't got the brains and most of all he hasn't got the ability. Once a hod carrier, always a hod carrier. \\u2018He doesn't offer anything to the game. He hasn't got skill, he doesn't make runs off the ball and he doesn't even tackle properly. \\u2018There's an art to tackling and it's nothing to do with the elbows in faces, eye-poking, testicle-grabbing and raking opponents down their Achilles tendons that he talks about. \\u2018In my day we went out to break an opponent's concentration \\u2014 not his leg. \\u2018There were plenty of verbals intended to frighten the life out of someone, but it disturbs me that Jones is talking proudly about hurting players. \\u2018He should have been banned for life for the disgraceful tackle that effectively ended the career of Gary Stevens at Spurs. \\u2018He tackled a player who was getting up after a challenge from someone else \\u2014 on the touchline. \\u2018How he ever got away with that I don't know. \\u2018I was no angel, but I was sent off just twice in over 20 years in the game and on both occasions it was for having a go at referees. \\u2018Nobody went out with the intention of hurting anyone. But Vinny talks as if everything is pre- meditated. Psyched \\u2018Vinny has always claimed the Wimbledon players psyched out the Liverpool team in the tunnel before the 1988 FA Cup final. \\u2018That's ludicrous. I'll tell you this \\u2014 if they had tried that on with the Liverpool team of the mid-1960s that included Ron Yeats, Ian St John, Gerry Byrne and myself the match would never have taken place. \\u2018We wouldn't have taken that. We'd have sorted them all out in the tunnel!\\u2019 I've got you taped TOMMY SMITH scoffs at the tough-guy claims of Vinny Jones (left), the Wimbledon ace who is in trouble with the FA over his video outburst. FLASHBACK: Tuesday's Mirror DURAN EASES IN ROBERTO Duran fed a steady diet of left jabs to Tony Biglen to win his first fight in 18 months at Buffalo, New York. The former holder of four world titles scored two knockdowns but there were boos in the late rounds when it became apparent that Duran, 41, wouldn't win by a knockout. The three judges each scored it 100\\u201386 for Panamanian Duran who was stopped in the sixth round by Pat Lawler in his last fight in March, 1991. Duran looked fitter than in some previous fights. His official weight was 11st 12lb \\u2014 1lb under the limit for the super-middleweight division in which he will campaign in the future. DURAN: Fitter FILTHY FIFTIES MIKE LANGLEY HARD men ain't what they used to be! The equipment is lighter. A whack in the face from a plastic ball is a lover's kiss compared with a teeth-loosening belt from an old-style football. Also sending-offs used to be rare. So it was Carry on Chopping in hard toe-caps. In the fifties at Old Trafford I watched an England forward stick his fingers into a keeper's eyes. Nothing's new! Derby manager Harry Storer swanked in those days: \\u2018I have a team of bastards \\u2014 and I'm the biggest bastard of them all.\\u2019 The high jump record of the Sixties was broken every time Cliff Huxford went into merciless action for Southampton. When Eddie Clamp played for Wolves and England, stretcher-bearers were on appearance money. Tommy Banks and Roy Hartle reigned through eight years of terror at Bolton under the slogan: \\u2018We gives 'em gravel-rash!\\u2019 They once warned the great Tom Finney: \\u2018Any hankypanky, Tommy, and tha\\u2019 goes on the track.\\u2019 Does no 1992 hard-man compare? Yes, Terry Hurlock of Southampton. He's the King, I'd say. Odd he's not on that video! Home, Robbo! MIKE LANGLEY SHOULDN'T Bobby Robson come home? Abroad doesn't suit him. Years ago at Vancouver he was replaced without warning by a pot-bellied Puskas. Knives were drawn during his two years with PSV in Holland. Now Robson's jeered off at Sporting Lisbon for losing a UEFA Cup tie. He's on \\u00a3300,000 in Portugal, but for how long? Get yourself an air ticket, Bob! Peter's war cry PONY-TAILED snooker star Peter Ebdon last night declared war on world number one Stephen Hendry. Ebdon, 22, faces the Scottish maestro in the fifth round of the \\u00a3224,000 Dubai Duty Free Classic tomorrow declaring: \\u2018I can beat him \\u2014 this is the first battle of a war. I hope Hendry's brought his golf clubs because he'll need them next week.\\u2019 EBDON: Confident Birdies singing for Sam SAM TORRANCE led the British charge with a seven-under-par 65 in the first round of the German Masters in Stuttgart yesterday. Torrance is two shots behind Swedish leader Robert Karlsson with Germany's Bernhard Langer and Italy's Constantino Rocca. Torrance, 39, believes he is still good enough to make next year's European Ryder Cup team and said: \\u2018People might think I'm too old but Ray Floyd is over 50 and still winning. \\u2018I first made the Cup team in 1981 and I desperately want to be in next year's.\\u2019 Despite having the worst of yesterday's weather, Torrance was so sharp with his putter that he had seven birdies and no bogeys. Karlsson had seven birdies and an eagle in his superb 63. LEIGH'S AUSSIE GLEE ROCK-BOTTOM Leigh have signed Australian forward John Elias from Sydney side Balmain. The 22-year-old pack ace will arrive tomorrow and could make his debut in Sunday's First Division home clash with Wigan. Leigh chief executive John Stringer said: \\u2018We have been trying to sign John for weeks. He is an aggressive player with plenty of pace.\\u2019 Widnes have transfer-listed Darren Wright, their 24-year-old former Great Britain centre, at his own request. The asking price is \\u00a3130,000. High dive MATT HUGHES DAVE BASSETT is ready to toss rookie goalkeeper Danny Wainwright into a shock Premier League assignment. \\u2018He'll have to sink or swim,\\u2019 says the Sheffield United boss. Wainwright is fifth choice at Bramall Lane and only made his debut for the reserves on Wednesday. But Bassett's number one, Simon Tracey, is out with shoulder damage. Phil Kite is struggling against a hand injury and Mel Rees faces a long recovery from cancer surgery last summer. \\u2018I've never known anything like it,\\u2019 said Bassett, relieved that Alan Kelly has recovered from a thigh problem in time to face Southampton tomorrow. \\u2018It looks like I'll have to put Danny on the bench and that will be a great opportunity for him. \\u2018I can't even talk about his future in the game because it's too early to say. \\u2018But if he gets into the Southampton match he'll just have to cope.\\u2019 HUGH JAMIESON SKIPPER Stewart Robson is set for a comeback as Coventry aim for the top in tomorrow's clash against Crystal Palace at Highfield Road. Midfield man Robson, who has missed four games because of a mysterious eye infection, warned: \\u2018It's so important we keep our run going. \\u2018People are now beginning to see the strength in depth we have, in view of our injuries, and they're impressed.\\u2019 Coventry, among the favourites for relegation at the start of the new Premier League, are three points adrift of leaders Norwich. But manager Bobby Gould insisted: \\u2018Stewart is such an inspiration to the rest of the side and we're glad to have him back.\\u2019 Robson, snapped up on a free transfer from West Ham last season, added: \\u2018I've had to be very careful because the trouble was caused by a virus infection. \\u2018It's taken this long to get over it and, as many good athletes have discovered to their cost, the temptation has always been to carry on training. It left me fatigued and in the mood to fall asleep every time I sat down.\\u2019 Meanwhile, Aston Villa manager Ron Atkinson, is following the lead of England supremo Graham Taylor for tomorrow's trip to Wimbledon. With Villa bidding to close the gap on Norwich, Atkinson has decided to complete preparations at England's Bisham Abbey training camp. Republic of Ireland left-back Steve Staunton is struggling with a knee injury and Bryan Small is standing by to make his first appearance of the season. ROBSON: Welcome return for Sky Blues GET SET ALLAN WELLS, the former Olympic sprint champion, is to help Second Division Reading with their speed and fitness. Player-manager Mark McGhee said: \\u2018The results Allan has achieved with other sportsmen and women are very impressive and if he can get an extra yard of pace out of our players, then it will be very worthwhile.\\u2019 Reading are at home to Fulham tonight. GOOD SPORTS: Fernand Felton and Paul Warhurst SHOOT-OUT COSTS \\u00a33M MATT HUGHES THE UEFA Cup shoot-out defeat in Moscow could have cost Manchester United up to \\u00a33 million. ITV had agreed an exclusive deal for all United's European games, promising the club a seven-figure reward if they reached the final. Executive Trevor East said: \\u2018When you add fees for overseas television rights, plus their gates and advertising sponsorship, you would have to think they could have more than doubled the figure we offered. \\u2018United have certainly lost a lot of money and next to United, there is no one more sorry about it than us.\\u2019 RON'S SECRET MATT HUGHES LIVERPOOL midfield star Ronnie Whelan has had a thigh operation and is out of the Republic of Ireland squad for the World Cup qualifying tie against European champions Denmark in Copenhagen on October 14. Liverpool kept the operation a closely-guarded secret but the 30-year-old Whelan, who had sore muscle tissue removed from his right thigh, was released from a Merseyside hospital yesterday. Only hours earlier, Whelan had been named in Jack Charlton's 22-man Irish squad. He hopes to make a come-back in two to three weeks. Charlton is unlikely to make any alterations to his squad until the weekend before the game, but Newcastle United skipper Liam O'Brien and veteran Blackburn defender Kevin Moran must now come into the reckoning. Mark Wright, bitterly disappointed at being axed by England, has resigned himself to missing tomorrow's Anfield battle with Sheffield Wednesday. Slump He is struggling to overcome a thigh injury and has seen his form slump as Liverpool suffer their worst start for 39 years. They are treading unfamiliar ground in the relegation zone and have failed to keep a clean sheet this season. Steve Nicol is also on the casualty list, which is likely to mean that Jan Molby will again pull on the armband. He was both a stand-in skipper and an emergency defender during Liverpool's successful European trip to Cyprus this week. Molby said: \\u2018I prefer to play in midfield but with the injuries we have got we have to find other ways. \\u2018Wherever you are asked to play you do your best. We're all in this together and we've got to get on with it together. \\u2018It was an honour to be captain in Cyprus and although I'd like to say it was not important, it is nice. \\u2018Even if it's only for one or two games it's something I'll always be able to look back on with pride.\\u2019 WHELAN: Operation costs him cap MOLBY: Proud SHARK BAIT! Knives are out for top bosses ALEX MURPHY/MARTIN RICHARDS LEEDS boss Doug Laughton and Liverpool manager Graeme Souness are swimming in the same shark-infested sea at the moment. They are in charge of world-famous clubs, but the job has turned into a nightmare for the pair of them. We're just five weeks into the season and the knives are out for Laughton after just one win in four championship games plus a second round exit from the Yorkshire Cup. Laughton is in the hottest of hot-seats in Rugby League but at least he has been spared the indignity of the bookies taking bets on his possible successor, as has happened to Souness. But a humiliating defeat at Bradford last Sunday had the Leeds fans spitting fury in radio phone-ins. And if Leeds lose against Warrington at Headingley tonight it will plunge the club into a full-blown crisis. The sharks will really smell blood. Warrington have the best half-back pairing in the game at the moment in Greg Mackey and Kevin Ellis and are quite capable of twisting the knife. Leeds can't make any more excuses about injuries, no matter how cruel they have been. It's a squad game and there is still enough ability at the club to do the business and win 90 per cent of their games. Many Leeds fans say the captaincy issue over Ellery Hanley and Garry Schofield is the main problem. Well if that's the case it must be sorted out once and for all if the club is to go forward. Laughton is in a hole and the players as professional sportsmen have a  responsibility to pull him out of it. Commitment They are playing for one of the biggest clubs in the game and that should be a source of pride, but that seemed to be painfully absent at Bradford last week. The players owe a debt to the club and those long-suffering fans who have made them among the best paid in the game. Laughton and his board have put faith in the players and they must repay that faith or look for another club. It's all about guts and commitment now. I feel sorry for Doug \\u2014 he cannot know where to turn. He's made mistakes, but like Souness he's in the painful process of re-building a side with a lot of new faces in the line-up. The game desperately needs a strong Leeds but if they don't stop the rot soon they can say goodbye to a top eight place, let alone the top four. Laughton has had no luck with injuries but every coach has to put up with that. Meanwhile the Leeds rumour factory is working overtime with stories that Schofield wants to leave and that players don't get on with their manager. The only way to stop these damaging rumours is for the players to back the manager on the field and start winning games again. FINS ain't what they used to be for Doug Laughton and Graeme Souness Doug's Wires worry EMBATTLED Leeds boss Doug Laughton admitted yesterday: \\u2018We must beat Warrington at all costs.\\u2019 The shock waves from last week's 36-6 crash at Bradford are still being felt at Headingley. And tonight's televised home game against the Wires is a vital one for the club and its fans. \\u2018We're desperate for a win and the players have been left in no doubt what I expect of them,\\u2019 said Laughton. \\u2018We have had bad luck with injuries but with the number of quality players at the club we should be a match for most teams. \\u2018Some players were just not doing their stuff at Bradford and there has been some strong talking this week.\\u2019 No way, Beardo SPURS' Norway goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt isn't shocked that Peter Beardsley and Chris Waddle have been left out of England's squad. \\u2018They haven't been involved for quite a while so you couldn't really expect them to be picked,\\u2019 said Thorstvedt, who is likely to be Norway's last line of defence on October 14. SHEER MAGIC UGLY DUCKLING CAN FOIL BRITS CHARLES FAWCUS CINDERELLA FILLY Magic Night can become the belle of the ball at Longchamp to-morrow by dancing home in Europe's top race, the Ciga Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Magic Night is the ugly duckling of French racing who was transformed into a golden swan when she ran second to Suave Dancer in this race last year. None of the big trainers wanted to know Magic Night as a youngster, so she passed into the care of little-known Philippe Demarcastel and made his name. Beautiful \\u2018Everyone says she isn't pretty, but she looks beautiful to me,\\u2019 he smiles. \\u2018She got out of trouble to win her pre-Arc race, the Prix Foy, but it would not have worried me if she was beaten then. The Arc is what we want and the Fox proved that she's in top form.\\u2019 Another young lady could pose the biggest threat to Magic Night tomorrow in the shape of User Friendly, who has put jockey George Duffield on the classic map after 20 years of trying. \\u2018Whatever happens in the Arc she is just a star and she is the one they've all got to beat,\\u2019 declares George. \\u2018St Jovite is the one I fear, but I don't think he's as dangerous on soft ground and we can do him.\\u2019 St Jovite has landed an unfavourable outside draw, but he reserves his best form for right-handed tracks like Longchamp and he's likely to be sharper than when beaten by Dr Devious at Leopardstown. Steve Cauthen is confident of a good run from Irish St Leger winner Mashaallah, but Magic Night has been in this battle before and this time she can win. Keen Hunter defends his Abbaye crown and the rain has come in time for John Gosden's flier. \\u2018He's back in good form,\\u2019 said the trainer. Garry set to glitter HUGH JAMIESON ASTON Villa manager Ron Atkinson yesterday backed \\u00a3650,000 mid-field man Garry Parker to push his claims for an England World Cup call-up. Parker, signed from Nottingham Forest nearly 12 months ago, has been placed on stand-by for England's qualifying clash against Norway at Wembley. And, as top six Villa today take on Wimbledon at Selhurst Park, Atkinson said: \\u2018I am very pleased for Parker but he has now got to make the next step. \\u2018The great thing about him is that he always wants the ball and always wants to use it. \\u2018He's proved that he is capable of scoring goals and although he can improve on the defensive side of his game his passing skills are a tremendous asset.\\u2019 As Villa wait for a fitness check on \\u00a31.1 million Republic of Ireland defender Steve Staunton, Atkinson warned: \\u2018No one relishes playing Wimbledon. \\u2018But we have got to play our football and earn a result.\\u2019 PARKER: On stand-by NEW YATES BLOW HUGH JAMIESON DEAN YATES, Notts County's \\u00a32million-rated centre-half, could be out for the rest of the season. Yates is still struggling to recover from a serious knee operation that cost him his place as County were relegated and missed out on a lucrative ticket to the Premier League. Yates, 25 later this month, has been tracked by a number of top clubs, including both Liverpool and Spurs, but manager Neil Warnock yesterday admitted: \\u2018His injury is not responding as well or as quickly as we had thought. \\u2018Now there is a possibility he could miss the entire season and I feel very sorry for him because he's put in so much hard work.\\u2019 Thrums up for Koloto EAGER Halifax have snapped up New Zealand Test forward Emosi Koloto on a month's loan. The ambitious Thrum Hall club moved quickly for Widnes's giant Tongan after their main target, second rower Trevor Gilmiester, opted to stay with Brisbane Broncos. Koloto goes straight in tomorrow at Hull, who have Aussies Ivan Henjak and James Grant making their debuts. It's a great chance for the 27-year-old to revive his career \\u2014 and Halifax could make the move permanent if he shows his fearsome form of three seasons ago. But the man who signed a 10-year contract in 1988 has struggled after two neck operations and is currently in the Widnes reserve side. Sheffield Eagles aim to prove they're top-four material against Castleford in tomorrow's match of the day. Eagles boss Gary Hetherington said: \\u2018It's the best side I've had since I came to the club.\\u2019 Aussie stand-off Peter Coyne is set to make his debut for Castleford after flying in on Thursday. KOLOTO: Struggling JASON TRIPPED BERNIE LOVETT DISGRACED Olympic sprinter Jason Livingstone has made a false start in his bid to become a professional footballer. Livingstone, sent home from Barcelona in July after testing positive for drugs abuse, yesterday trained with Third Division club Cardiff City. The club was expected to give him a run next week in one of two friendlies against non-League opposition, but last night coach Eddie May said: \\u2018He is a good lad but is just a non-starter now. \\u2018At first I didn't realise who he was. He showed a fair bit of talent. \\u2018But when I found out about his background, I just had to blow it out of the water. It will end there.\\u2019 LIVINGSTONE: No go CITY SLICKER HUGH JAMIESON NEW signing Les Sealey has been ordered to be a big noise at St. Andrew's by Birmingham City manager Terry Cooper. Sealey, signed on a month's loan from Aston Villa, makes his debut at Oxford today with Cooper saying: \\u2018He's a good goalkeeper but he is also extrovert and loud. \\u2018That's the way I want him because we have a quiet bunch of lads who need bossing about.\\u2019 Birmingham's first-choice goalkeeper Andy Gosney is currently out of action with a shoulder injury. Sealey has been kept out of the first team picture at Villa by Nigel Spink. SEALEY: Extrovert CLOSE SHAVE! HUGH JAMIESON WOLVES have won a race against time to clear \\u00a3325,000 Paul Blades for tomorrow's televised clash with West Ham. They clinched the deal for the Norwich defender just six minutes before the deadline. And delighted Blades, who began the season on a month's loan at Molineux, insisted: \\u2018I never wanted to leave in the first place.\\u2019 Said Wolves boss Graham Turner: \\u2018He will strengthen our squad considerably. Promotion is the priority and I hope our missing fans will see this as a positive move in the right direction.\\u2019 BLADES: Rush job Ardiles swoops WEST Bromwich Albion manager Ossie Ardiles has strengthened his Second Division table-topping side by signing Huddersfield Town midfielder Kevin Donovan. Ardiles moved for 20-year-old Donovan after watching him star for Huddersfield during their Coca-Cola Cup clash with Blackburn Rovers. The fee for the move will be decided by a tribunal unless the two clubs can agree a figure. Donovan looks set to be named in the Albion squad for today's trip to Burnley. MARCO'S GOALO! DERBY County's ton-up striker Marco Gabbiadini is hungry for more goals today against Cambridge. The 24-year-old, who scored his 100th goal last Saturday, last night warned: \\u2018I'm out to double my total.\\u2019 Saints battle SOUTHAMPTON are battling to prevent talented England B winger Matthew Le Tissier following Rod Wallace and Alan Shearer out of the Dell. Saints manager Ian Branfoot is fighting off strong competition from Liverpool, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton by offering Le Tissier a new contract even though his present agreement does not expire until July. Branfoot said: \\u2018Matt has not come back with an answer but we are still in the early stages of negotiation.\\u2019 LE TISSIER: Offer TOO HOT TO TROT NEW England recruit Richard Jobson celebrated his full England call-up yesterday \\u2014 in bed. Oldham's classy defender was told to stay at home after phoning Boundary Park to say he was running a temperature of 102. He is likely to miss tomorrow's televised home game against Everton. Boss Joe Royle also has doubts over midfield ace Nick Henry (ankle), Neil Adams (knee) and Norwegian international Gunnar Halle (calf). \\u2018We look to have a few problems,\\u2019 he admitted yesterday. Royle has named five Goodison old boys in the 16-man squad to face the club where he started his career. The Oldham manager added: \\u2018It is always nice to see old friends, but there will be no divided loyalties \\u2014 we need the three points.\\u2019 JOBSON: Bedridden Sharp test faces Paul RICHARD TANNER PAUL Rideout goes into a Sky TV shoot-out with Graeme Sharp at Boundary Park tomorrow, anxious to prove he can be the latest in a long line of great Everton centre-forwards. Still waiting for his first goal since his \\u00a3500,000 summer move from Rangers, Rideout has been unfavourably compared with the Scots striker who left Goodison for Oldham last year. Rideout, boosted by scoring twice for the reserves in midweek, admitted last night: \\u2018Graeme's been one of the top strikers in the game for several years and he is a hard act to follow. \\u2018He was one of the best at his job and enjoyed a lot of success at Everton. I know I've got to start scoring and it would be nice to get off the mark at last on Sunday. \\u2018I've had a shoulder injury for the last three or four games and it's the last thing you need when you are struggling to score your first goal. But getting two for the reserves was encouraging.\\u2019 Everton's early season bubble has burst dramatically with five defeats in their last six games. But Peter Beardsley could be back earlier than expected. He faces a fitness test today on the hamstring strain that has kept him out for two matches. COUNTY'S TOP MARK BARNSLEY centre-back and skipper Mark Smith yesterday joined Notts County for \\u00a370,000. Smith, 32, was earlier offered in part exchange for County striker Kevin Wilson, 31 \\u2014 but the deal fell through. Wilko's revenge COLIN DIBALL MIDDLESBROUGH players are out to get their own back against the team that killed their dream of a first-ever major Wembley final. Manchester United pipped them in last season's Rumbelows Cup semi-final thriller and could pay for it today. Said Boro striker Paul Wilkinson: \\u2018We would love to put one over on them. \\u2018We could not have got any closer to Wembley than we did in those two games. \\u2018If we slip up and drop into mid-table, people will say that our start to the season was just a flash in the pan. \\u2018We know otherwise. We firmly believe that we are top eight material and we'll score against the best teams. Star \\u2018This gives us a great chance to put things right.\\u2019 Boss Lennie Lawrence believes that last season's cup conflict was written in the stars. Manchester United went on to lift the trophy, but missed out on the Championship, while losers Boro followed up by clinching promotion. \\u2018I firmly believe United would have won the title but for Wembley, while if we'd got there we wouldn't have gone up. \\u2018Whoever tops them this season will win the League.\\u2019 Lawrence dug out videos of the semi-final clashes to show his players this week. Boro will be backed by a full-house 26,000 crowd today. But they won't have injured duo John Hendrie and Willie Falconer in their bid to down the Reds. WILKINSON: Confident TOP GUN! Graham tribute to Adams the Amazing NIGEL CLARKE TONY ADAMS heads for the World Cup heights boosted by George Graham's belief that he can become one of the greatest Arsenal captains of all time. As his skipper celebrated his recall to the England squad, Gunners boss Graham said yesterday: \\u2018I can tell you categorically from talking to the top managers that Adams is the player they'd all want in their side. \\u2018I can understand why Graham Taylor selects him. He's 25, has already won two championships and is a winner. \\u2018Ask anybody at this club just what his value is to Arsenal. He's a great leader and although he has done so much, he still has a great future in front of him.\\u2019 England boss Taylor has made no secret of his admiration for the pride and passion Adams puts into his efforts for his country. Only a UEFA ruling prevented tiger Tony coming to the rescue of Taylor's injury-hit squad in Sweden this summer \\u2014 and now he's back in the frame for the Norway game on Wednesday week. The taunts and torments from the terraces that made Adams\\u2019 life a misery have now been shaken off once and for all. Marvellous And Graham claimed: \\u2018Frank McLintock was a marvellous skipper \\u2014 I should know because I played in the same team with him. \\u2018But Adams could run him close and I can't see any reason why he can't go on to get still more honours with Arsenal.\\u2019 Graham reckons it's time his side went gunning for trophies again \\u2014 starting with today's clash against Chelsea. He said: \\u2018I look at myself and what I have achieved on a time-scale of every two years. \\u2018We didn't win anything last season, so I'm looking for success this season. \\u2018I'll be very disappointed if Arsenal don't pick up something.\\u2019 In 1987, the Gunners won the League Cup, followed by the Championship in 1989 and then a second title in 1991. That has whetted Graham's appetite for more honours \\u2014 and he accepts he'll have to keep filling the Highbury trophy room if he is to guarantee his future at the club. \\u2018Winning is my driving force,\\u2019 he admitted. \\u2018I put that before anything. I've never been out of work and I don't want to be. I have to pay the bills. \\u2018But I know I've got to be as successful over the next five to eight years as I have been so far. \\u2018I want to produce a winning side, that's what motivates me. I tell that to my players. \\u2018There are stars I have simply not brought to Highbury because they have been more concerned with the money they could make rather than what they could achieve for Arsenal.\\u2019 Rapid With the Gunners looking to make a rapid movement up the Premier League, Graham added: \\u2018I would like to be higher in the table and now it's time to put things right. \\u2018All I know is that we are good enough to be up there at the end of the season.\\u2019 TONY ADAMS points the way to new glory \\u2014 and George Graham says he can become an all-time great as Arsenal captain HANDING IT TO ADAMS: George Graham rates Tony in the McLintock class DOPEY DAUM IN DRUGS STORM special on the man at the centre of Leeds Euro storm Stuttgart boss gave his squad steroids HARRY HARRIS STUTTGART manager Christoph Daum, the man who blundered in using four foreign players against Leeds United, is at the centre of a drugs storm in Germany. And he is known for his after-match tantrums, which include an incident when he kicked down an advertising board. The 38-year-old Daum blurted out his drugs secret in a hotel bar after Stuttgart had beaten Hanover to win the German Super Cup. \\u2018Doping in the Bundesliga\\u2019 screamed one newspaper headline the next day \\u2014 and Daum backtracked fast. \\u2018No club dopes its players,\\u2019 he insisted. \\u2018I explained myself badly.\\u2019 Daum claimed that his players had been given the new sports designer drug Clenbuterol simply to heal persistent muscle injuries. It had NOT been used to enhance their performance. The Clenbuterol row was an innocent mistake, according to Daum. Just like using four foreigners against Howard Wilkinson's men in the European Cup had been a mistake\\u2026 Daum later explained his Hanover confession, saying that he was not a doctor and that he had mixed up one or two things. Banned But, surely, he must have known that German sprint star Katrin Krabbe was banned after being positively tested for Clenbuterol? And this was also the drug that caused British weightlifters Andrew Saxton and Andrew Davies to be booted out of the Barcelona Olympics. The German Soccer Federation weren't convinced by Daum, the man who was often controversial in his long association with Cologne. Hamburg president Manfred Ommer has been especially outspoken, even casting doubts on Stuttgart's championship win. The Federation are investigating the Daum drugs affair. And they are looking into an incident last month when Daum angrily kicked in an advertising board. Daum now wants UEFA to accept that the rules regarding foreign players are for everyone else \\u2014 but not for him because he had yet another excusable lapse of memory. The rules are specific and well-known. They can hardly have come as such a surprise to Daum. He might just get the benefit of the doubt \\u2014 because his side were under such intense pressure in the last ten minutes at Elland Road that his mind was concentrated on the battle on the field. But Daum coolly, cynically and calculatingly named the four foreigners in his squad from the start. And that, in itself, broke the rules! If he had no intention of using four foreigners, why did he have them among his sixteen? Today Daum hopes UEFA will not disqualify Stuttgart when they debate Elland Road. Daum said that he had thought before Wednesday's 4-1 defeat that it was possible to field four non-German players. \\u2018The problem was not with UEFA's complicated regulations,\\u2019 he said on German radio. \\u2018It was with me. I should read through these things carefully.\\u2019 But Stuttgart had those four non-nationals on the pitch in the last seven minutes, one outsider too many. Stuttgart were last night wary of commenting in case they influenced the UEFA ruling. They hope that the fact they reported the matter will help them avoid a disqualification. Wary A Stuttgart source denied a statement by Leeds secretary Nigel Pleasants that the English club had instigated the UEFA inquiry. \\u2018Our president informed a leading UEFA official straight away on Thursday morning at a memorial service for the former German soccer federation president,\\u2019 the source said. \\u2018It was a matter of us owning up ourselves.\\u2019 But the rumour in Germany is that a member of the public shopped Stuttgart by making a call to UEFA. They broke the rules. Let's hope that UEFA remember there must never be one rule for the big boys and another for the rest. Chris crisis BOSS Christoph Daum blunders (right) with his fatal substitution, and (left) his team look relieved at the final whistle, unaware of the shock in store. RIVAL boss Howard Wilkinson must sweat today while UEFA reach a verdict Yesterday's sensation Francis pledge TREVOR FRANCIS last night prepared to pile on the torment for German football. The Sheffield Wednesday player-boss was handed a tough UEFA Cup second round draw with former German champions Kaiserslautern. But after seeing Celtic sensationally overturn a two-goal deficit against Cologne and Stuttgart land in the dock for fielding too many foreigners against Leeds, Francis said: \\u2018Their League has suffered a bit from an exodus of top stars to Italy. And my players can be greatly encouraged by what happened during the week. \\u2018Although any draw against German opposition represents a big challenge, because I've got the greatest respect and admiration for what they've done at club and international level for over 20 years. \\u2018But we can take heart from the Celtic and Leeds results and carry a lot of optimism with us into the first leg in Germany. \\u2018I don't know much about Kaiserslautern, except that they finished fifth last season and were champions the year before, but we will certainly have them watched.\\u2019 England marksman David Hirst has trained for the first time in five weeks after recovering from a cracked ankle, and is desperate to link up with Chris Waddle. FRANCIS: Respect BATTLE OF BRITAIN CROWD FEARS JIM RODGER THE Battle of Britain between Rangers and Leeds United is the European tie that nobody wants. But it's not for football that they fear \\u2014 it is for the danger of crowd violence. Rangers' boss Walter yesterday refused to be drawn into any speculation about the possibility of the champions of Scotland and England meeting. Leeds have protested that Stuttgart broke the rule of playing four non-nationals instead of three in their first round clash and UEFA bosses will make their decision today. Said Smith: \\u2018At the moment chaos reigns. The only thing we can do is to send our spies to watch Leeds United and Stuttgart. \\u2018Our director's secretary Campbel Ogilvie is over for the draw and he will stay until a decision is made on the situation.\\u2019 Smith and Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson don't fear a clash of football skills between their champion teams. But last night police and safety experts admitted they were worried. They are fully aware that Rangers, who have Englishmen Mark Hateley, Dale Gordon and Trevor Steven in their squad, have a great record of avoiding trouble in recent years. But the nagging doubts of the Scots being involved with their English rivals could be a headache. For the clashes between Rangers and English clubs when they invaded Newcastle, Wolverhampton and London are best forgotten \\u2014 as are England's blackest moments when they were banned from Europe because of Liverpool's trouble abroad. Should they clash a solution could be that both clubs be allowed to play only before their own supporters with live television at Elland Road and Ibrox to be watched by the stay at home fans. Rangers faced Leeds United in the season of 1967-68 in the quarter final of the Fairs Cup, now the UEFA competition. Leeds defeated Rangers 2-0 at Elland Road and had a no-scoring draw at Ibrox, and went on to win the competition. In 1970 Leeds lost to Celtic 1-0 at Elland Road and 2-1 at Hampden before a crowd of 130,000.

MADE IN ENGLAND: Rangers' Hateley and Gordon ARABS IN SHEIKH-UP CHARLES FAWCUS STEVE CAUTHEN collected his eleventh ton at Newmarket yesterday \\u2014 wearing the maroon livery of boss Sheikh Mohammed \\u2014 but that could be a thing of the past. Racing's big spenders from the Middle East are threatening to pull the plug \\u2014 and take their horses to France in search of bigger prize money. The Maktoum family paid out fortunes for horses in the eighties and owned the stars as well. But they have not made a single bid at Britain's top yearling sale this week. Family member Sheikh Mana said: \\u2018We like British racing best of all, but when you are losing money you have to review your policy. \\u2018If your horse wins and is placed a couple of times you still lose and that is ridiculous. But prize money isn't the only reason.\\u2019 Yesterday's Middle Park Stakes was won well by Zieten, ridden by Cauthen, after Frankie Dettori had nearly stolen the race on Pips Pride. \\u2018There was no pace and he got a big advantage when he quickened up. My horse did well to catch him,\\u2019 said Steve. \\u2018He's a fighter,\\u2019 agreed trainer Andre Fabre, who runs his No 1 youngster Zafonic at Longchamp tomorrow. Favourite Silver Wizard ran too freely and Willie Carson said: \\u2018He's gone over the top.\\u2019 Crazed GREEK fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones and fireworks at the referee and Paris St Germain players in the UEFA Cup match in Salonika. The match was abandoned, PSG going through 4-0. \\u00a310M BENN-ANZA Eu can cash in Nigel IAN GIBB NIGEL Benn hauled himself back on Millionaires Row here in Italy by cutting up Mauro Galvano and grabbing the WBC world super middleweight title. By conservative estimates the Dark Destroyer can earn at least \\u00a31million in the next 12 months. He can start in Scotland on December 13 by going back to his world title roots with a defence against rugged American Doug DeWitt, against whom Nigel first became a world champion by winning the WBO middleweight crown back in April 1990. And he can finish a golden year late next summer with the much-awaited showdown against Chris Eubank, who took Benn's WBO middleweight title nearly two years ago before moving up himself to the 12 stone limit. All that and Benn has made the grand gesture of giving his new WBC belt to his first conqueror, Michael Watson, who is slowly recovering after the brain damage he suffered against Eubank last year. \\u2018Yes, I want the Eubank return and Iran Barkley as well because he gives me the fear I thrive on,\\u2019 said Benn. He'd just become the first Briton to win two world titles on foreign soil and added: \\u2018I want to be the first British fighter to win three world titles at different weights.\\u2019 And now Benn can claim he has the senior crown as the WBC title is regarded as more prestigious than the WBO version held by Eubank. Benn said: \\u2018Before, it was Eubank dictating the pace \\u2014 not any more.\\u2019 And even the watching Eubank had to admit: \\u2018He has everything I want and I've got everything he wants. Now we're on mutual ground.\\u2019 But it all nearly went horribly wrong as Benn cursed the \\u2018scumbags\\u2019 who tried to rob him of this title. The Italian dirty tricks department worked overtime as Galvano's management tried to scream \\u2018no contest\\u2019, claiming a head clash caused the badly cut left eye that meant their man couldn't go on after the third round. Benn said: \\u2018I thought they'd give it to him or a draw or some rubbish like that. I was ready to cry. \\u2018There are so many scumbags in boxing \\u2014 but I have to thank Barry Hearn and the American referee Joe Cortez for standing up for me.\\u2019 The Italian crowd went berserk when they realised their man had lost his title, and showered Benn with coins and rubbish. Benn promised that the first thing he would do when returning home would be to go straight to see Michael Watson. Benn said: \\u2018The WBC belt is his now. I am happy enough just being world champion again.\\u2019 ANGRY TV fight fans rang LWT to protest over Nigel Benn's language. After a clash with ITV interviewer Gary Newbon, Benn rounded on the \\u2018armchair critics who said I'm washed up\\u2019 and blasted: \\u2018They aren't worth a hand job.\\u2019 \\u2018We had a handful of complaints,\\u2019 said a spokesman  TRIUMPHANT Nigel Benn will give his new WBC belt to Michael Watson. Hulme dies DENNY Hulme, world Formula One champion in 1967, died during the Bathurst 1000 motor endurance race near Sydney, Australia, yesterday. His BMW hit an embankment and coasted slowly off the track with Hulme, 56, apparently already dead at the wheel from a heart attack. MATT HUGHES Two players were sent off as BRIDGEND fought out a 12-12 draw at home to PONTYPRIDD. Ponty skipper Nigel Bezani was first to go for a high tackle in which he elbowed centre John Apsee, but the Bridgend man admitted: \\u2018I was surprised he was sent off.\\u2019 Following Bezani's early exit, Apsee's team-mate Jeff Jenkins was also dismissed for a late challenge on Ponty's Nick Jones. Luc Evans kicked four penalties for Bridgend. Wales' outside half, Neil Jenkins, in his first game after suspension, also replied with four penalties for the visitors. RED HOT Good times are ready to roll MATT HUGHES ALAN DAVIES believes the good times are about to start rolling again for Wales this week. The national coach sends his dragons into battle in Cardiff on Wednesday, already breathing fire and ready to scorch Italy in Wales' opening international of the season. World champions Australia are then the next visitors to the Arms Park in just six weeks, with grand slammers England on the guest list to open the Five Nations Championship. But Davies insists: \\u2018I'm very encouraged by what I've seen in Welsh club rugby this season. \\u2018The new rules are perfectly suited to traditional Welsh running rugby. They could be brilliant for Wales. I love them!\\u2019 Davis was at St Helen's to see Heineken League champions SWANSEA continue their unbeaten start to the season with a superb 29-12 victory over rivals NEATH. With Wales' top clubs running in sackfuls of tries and playing to packed houses, Davies believes the national side are poised to reap the benefits. \\u2018We now have five or six clubs in Wales that could hold their own against any in Europe,\\u2019 he said. Swansea's victory kept them top of the First Division and was another display worthy of any defending champions. Wales star Scott Gibbs grabbed a brilliant try against his former club and others came from skipper Stuart Davies, Aled Williams and a blistering individual effort by flying wing Simon Davies. SWANSEA'S Robin McBride challenges Neath's Andrew Thomas, as the League champions sweep to an impressive 29-12 win at St Helen's IT'S OVER MIKE LANGLEY MANCHESTER UNITED and Leeds were first and second on this day last year \\u2014 and they kept it a two-horse race to the end in the old First Division. That won't happen this time. I believe we've seen the end of Norwich. They'll never come back from that 7-1 slaughter at Blackburn \\u2014 at least, not as champions. I see the Canaries' fall as the shake-up into a new, possibly permanent, top four: Blackburn, United, Villa and QPR. Should Blackburn hold on to the end, don't taunt Kenny Dalglish about buying the title. He has the answer pat: \\u2018Money's the quickest way to build. Ask anybody who hasn't got it!\\u2019 Or ask Alex Ferguson \\u2014 after only three goals in United's last six matches, how must he feel now about being outbid by Kenny for \\u00a33.3million Alan Shearer? FANTASIAARGH! NIGEL CLARKE YES, Clarke's Cauliflowers still prop up Radio Five's Fantasy Football League. But the Cauli-wobbles are at an end. Advice from England No 2 Lawrie McMenemy has helped me survive my first crisis as a manager. We were leaking goals but I've plugged the gaps and with McMenemy's help, got a vote of confidence from chairman Keith Fisher. That's what worries me most! Rules for fools MIKE LANGLEY THE \\u2018three foreigners only\\u2019 rule is an anti-British measure, framed by envious Continentals. There was no coincidence about its introduction as our champions ended six years of exile from the European Cup. The influential Germans were particularly jealous. Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest and Villa had all won Europe's champion trophy \\u2014 with only Bayern and Hamburg from the Bundesliga being successful. The flashy Italians also lagged behind us, so did the Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch. What a crafty remedy to attack the source of Football League strength, the historic blend of English, Scots, Welsh and Irish? Suppose George Best, Pat Crerand, Shay Brennan and Tony Dunne had been \\u2018foreigners\\u2019 in 1968. Would United have won the European Cup? How comical that an English club should benefit from the rule. Good luck to Leeds. But when the replay's over, they must campaign in UEFA for an all-British assault on this clumsily drafted daftness! ARC ACHE! User Friendly pipped on post CHARLES FAWCUS USER FRIENDLY came within an ace of a French fortune yesterday as the Arc was snatched away from her in the shadow of the winning post. Britain's four-legged champion failed by just a neck to add Europe's toughest race to her unbeaten haul, but she proved a fighter to the end. And George Duffield knows she has the star quality to come back and go one better next year. Battle \\u2018You can't be disappointed by a run like that,\\u2019 said the jockey after User Friendly's head-to-head battle with Subotica had gone so narrowly the wrong way for her army of fans. \\u2018We got beaten today by the slow early pace which made her too keen and, in hindsight, a pacemaker would have helped, but we weren't to know that. \\u2018Every time Subotica looked to have her beaten she came at him again and it was only in the last two strides that she lost. I honestly believe that she is good enough to win the King George and the Arc next year.\\u2019 Most British observers will remember Subotica having a desperate run in the Coronation Cup, but things went his way yesterday although trainer Andre Fabre believed that Pat Eddery's mount Jolypha would be his No 1. St Jovite was in a winning position on the final bend, but the race soon developed into its final desperate duel. Outsider Vert Amande kept St Jovite out of third, with old rival Dr Devious two places behind. Earlier in the afternoon Arazi returned to form in brilliant style. He slaughtered tough opposition headed by Calling Collect, and Steve Cauthen smiled all the way from the winning line to the unsaddling enclosure. \\u2018When he's good he's electric. It's fantastic to see him back,\\u2019 said Cauthen, and  Arazi now bids for Breeders Cup Mile glory in four weeks. Lester Piggott is another comeback expert and he eased home on Mr Brooks in the British-dominated Abbaye. Keen Hunter was second and luckless Elbio third. Cauthen was second again on odds-on Kindergarten in the Boussac won by outsider Gold Splash, with Love Of Silver third.

A WEE PROBLEM GARY SPEED LEEDS United's Gary Speed had a wee problem when being dope tested after the recent match against Everton. Unable to \\u2018hit the bottle\\u2019, Gary had to take the official doctor home with him before he could provide the required sample. GOAL GUY POMPEY'S smart Guy Whittingham scored his second hat-trick of the season but couldn't keep the match ball as a memento. A delighted fan had taken it home  GOOD SHOW COLIN DIBALL S'land 2, Millwall 0 DON GOODMAN grabbed the goals that took the heat off boss Malcolm Crosby\\u2026but gave the credit to striker sidekick Peter Davenport. \\u2018He was my man of the match,\\u2019 said two-goal Goodman. \\u2018I thought he was superb, and I got the benefit.\\u2019 Transfer-listed Davenport couldn't remember the last time he'd played alongside deadly Don in the league. \\u2018It could have been as long ago as last Christmas,\\u2019 he said. But, on this evidence, the 31-year-old former England international won't have to wait another ten months before linking up again. Davenport asked for a move last month because he couldn't get a first team chance. Now Crosby insists: \\u2018If he keeps playing as he did today he's not going anywhere.\\u2019 Davenport had a hand in both goals, hit the post and laid on the ball that should have brought Sunderland a penalty \\u2014 and Goodman his hat-trick \\u2014 until referee Bill Flood decided otherwise. Said Davenport: \\u2018All I want to do is hold down a place in the side. I've kept myself fit and I was raring to go. I enjoyed it.\\u2019 It was Millwall's first defeat in eight games and Crosby said: \\u2018It has been a hard time. People have criticised us with some justification, but I don't feel under pressure. \\u2018Now I hope this result lifts everybody's confidence.\\u2019 GOODMAN: Thankful Clarke facing final KO Leigh 16, Wigan 36 GREAT BRITAIN star Phil Clarke was sent off as ton-up Wigan took their points tally to 114 in five scintillating days. Loose forward Clarke was given his marching orders by Widnes ref Stuart Cummings seven minutes from time for a high tackle on Aussie centre Scott Mahon. That means Clarke will miss the Greenalls Lancashire Cup final in a fortnight, assuming Wigan beat Oldham in tomorrow's semi-final and he receives more than a one-match ban. Wigan notched seven tries against luckless Leigh, including Australian centre Andrew Farrar's first touchdowns for the club. Farrar, in his fourth outing for the Central Park giants, notched a try in each half with Shaun Edwards also sweeping over for a couple. Edwards took his season's tally to 17 after bagging ten in Tuesday's 78-0 destruction of Swinton. But Leigh, trailing 20-0 after half an hour, produced some fine rugby highlighted by surging runs from props Tim Street and Tongan Lee Hansen. Winger Gareth Pratt, signed from Rochdale amateur club Mayfield, bagged a debut try for the home team after David Hill and Mike Blakeley had also crossed. CLARKE: Sent packing BRISTOL ROVERS boss Dennis Rofe was involved in a war of words with counterpart Neil Warnock after their 3-3 thriller with NOTTS COUNTY. Warnock claimed that both Andy Reece and Geoff Twentyman should have been sent off.

IAN GETS A WRIGHT RESULT MATT HUGHES IAN WRIGHT looks certain to escape action over his latest brush with rival fans. As police probe allegations that the controversial Arsenal striker made a V-sign at Chelsea supporters on Saturday, Wright found an unlikely ally yesterday \\u2014 the FA. And suspicions are growing that he could be the victim of a dirty-tricks campaign. It's the second time in a month that the Highbury hit-man has been accused of insulting fans. But lack of evidence, including close scrutiny of a video, is likely to bring the same \\u2018not proven\\u2019 verdict that followed the Wimbledon game. Said FA spokesman David Bloomfield: \\u2018If players are guilty of making gestures it is something we take seriously. But perhaps you do need to question the motives of some people who report these alleged incidents.\\u2019 WE LOVE YOU -YEAH! -YEAH! -YEAH! KEEGANMANIA AS THE EX-BEATLE HITS LONDON TOWN KEV GETS BACK WHERE HE BELONGS NIGEL CLARKE BRENTFORD 1 NEWCASTLE 2 KEVIN KEEGAN'S Geordie dream lived on yesterday as Newcastle won their ninth successive match and opened up a five-point lead at the top of the First Division. They swaggered to a classy, confident victory full of irresistible one-touch football that took the Magpies ever closer to Reading's 1985 record of 13 wins in a row at the start of a season. Like the Beatles, Keegan was a legend in Liverpool and he has given United a dream ticket to ride all the way back to the Premier League. Keegan was cheered and chanted for by United's 3,000 fans throughout the match \\u2014 a Geordie version of \\u2018We love you, yeah, yeah, yeah! And he has given the club back its pride, passion, and the kind of penetrative football that has awoken the North East. Terrific Said Keegan: \\u2018I've told the lads they can write themselves into the record books. And I'm just lucky to be manager of such a good side. \\u2018We've had a terrific start and it's no fluke. We can stay at the top because we've got a good enough squad to keep us there. \\u2018The swirling wind took away from us what we are best at \\u2014 playing neat football \\u2014 but we still showed what we could do.\\u2019 He went on: \\u2018I told the lads they can create something to tell their kids and grandchildren about because if we do beat Reading's run, the record will stand for a long, long time. \\u2018We are the biggest club in football not to have had any recent success, but right now the city is rocking. \\u2018I'm scared to go there at the moment. There is so much emotion around, and so much expectancy. \\u2018And there are people now outside Newcastle who want to see us get that record and also be successful. \\u2018Brentford gave us a terrific battle but we deserved to win even though we missed chances. \\u2018I was delighted for the fans who travelled 300 miles south to see us. We are on a roll and it's great to be involved.\\u2019 Added Keegan: \\u2018They say that everything comes to those who wait. Well Newcastle folk have been waiting a long time, and we all badly want to give them something to celebrate.\\u2019 But Brentford boss Phil Holder believes the Geordie dream can still be shattered \\u2014 and soon. He said: \\u2018Newcastle are not unbeatable, but having said that they are a formidable team. \\u2018Someone will do them, that's for sure. I'll have a bet with you right now they don't go throughout the season unbeaten. \\u2018If you put them under enough pressure, if you run at them, they will crack, but I can't be too bolshie about it.\\u2019 Holder has a point. For Newcastle, having built up a two-goal lead could have been caught by the Bees' stirring comeback. After Gary Blissett had pulled one back in the 78th minute, substitute Marcus Gayle missed a great chance four minutes from the final whistle to level it. Newcastle began brightly with a goal in the 10th minute that caught the Bees cold. Steve Howey picked out David Kelly, who was allowed to run through as Brentford played for offside, to bury a right-foot shot inside the near post. The Bees didn't know who to mark as United switched their play and their players to totally confuse them with classy running that carried the hallmarks of good coaching. But United had reason to congratulate goalkeeper Tommy Wright for a spectacular save in the 33rd minute that stopped Brentford going level. Blissett took the ball from Howey, then exploded a right-foot volley that Wright somehow juggled over the crossbar. United passed the ball sweetly between each other to continue to create chances that should have put the game beyond Brentford, and it was no surprise when, in the 63rd minute, they created a fine goal that stretched Brentford to breaking point. Beresford fed the ball in to Robert Lee, who turned and cracked a shot against the crossbar. But Peacock, back in the side after missing five games through injury, was quickest to react and headed the ball home.

The champions faxed a protest to UEFA after being ordered to meet Stuttgart on neutral territory. But Europe's governing body left them in no doubt they were wasting their time by replying: \\u2018It's just not possible.\\u2019 UEFA want the game to go ahead on Saturday in Barcelona, and are negotiating the release of Leeds players from World Cup duty. There is a direct conflict of interest for Scotland's Gary McAllister, England pair David Batty and Tony Dorigo, Wales winger Gary Speed and France's Eric Cantona. And England boss Graham Taylor has already warned that he would invoke the six-day release rule if the game is played this weekend. But Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson will be just as keen for his players to throw their weight behind the club's bid for a glamour second-round tie with Rangers.

B-ROOSED! AUSSIES ARE HERE MARTIN RICHARDS THE MIGHTY Kangaroos touched down in Manchester yesterday and betrayed their Wembley nerves. Coach Bobby Fulton admitted Great Britain are favourites for the World Cup on October 24 and said: \\u2018It's a gamble conceding home advantage.\\u2019 Britain won the last encounter between the two sides at Wembley when a 52,000 crowd lifted them to a famous first Test win in 1990. The occasion seemed to get to the Aussies then, and this time there will be a 78,000 full house to worry them. With this summer's titanic battle for the Ashes still fresh in the memory, Fulton added: \\u2018Everything is stacked against us, but that doesn't mean we won't win. \\u2018We've come three weeks early so that we can get in plenty of training, plus the three warm-up games. \\u2018We can't afford to lose. It's a one-off and we have to prove we are worthy world champions.\\u2019 Eleven of the squad haven't played for six weeks. But Fulton said: \\u2018We have a strong squad with new names to look out for in Tim Brasher, Brad Godden and Steve Renouf.\\u2019 Injury has stripped Fulton of full-back Andrew Ettingshausen and stand-off Laurie Daley. The dazzling Steve Renouf is expected to team up with Meninga in the centre, and Newcastle's Mark Sargent will wear the No 8 shirt. Hopes are still alive that the planned world club title game between Wigan and the Brisbane Broncos will go ahead at Central Park the week after the final. The Rugby League are still talking to sponsors and an announcement is expected on Thursday. The Walker brothers \\u2014 Kevin, Kerrod and Stephen \\u2014 jet in with the Aussie team yesterday Picture: KEVIN FITZPATRICK Stock take QUEENS Park Rangers are enquiring about Ipswich's play-anywhere star Mick Stockwell. The \\u00a3700,000-rated Stockwell has this season excelled at full-back, in midfield and as a goalscoring makeshift striker. Gordon Durie's misconduct case was today re-arranged for Friday, October 16. The Spurs striker is alleged to have feigned being head-butted by Coventry's Andy Pearce. Don't talk just play! ALAN WEST DALIAN ATKINSON doesn't want to hear any championship chat around Villa Park just yet! The \\u00a31.7 million striker declared: \\u2018We are building a squad, but to talk about winning titles at this stage isn't on. \\u2018This team is getting stronger and stronger and, just like every other club, we hope we can win it. But it's much too early to have a load of championship talk going on. I know it's a cliche but we really do have to take it from game to game \\u2014 it's the only way.\\u2019 Atkinson scored a wonder goal in the 3-2 win over Wimbledon which had namesake Villa boss Ron Atkinson declaring: \\u2018For me Dalian has got the goal of the season.\\u2019 Portsmouth manager Jim Smith was yesterday preparing to hold off a bid from Nottingham Forest for \\u00a31.5 million rated striker Guy Whittingham. The man who cost Portsmouth just \\u00a3450 when they bought him out of the army netted his second hat-trick of the season on Saturday and in turn became leading scorer in the First Division. Now Whittingham is the target for Brian Clough to help end his side's disastrous start to the season. But Smith, who turned down a \\u00a31 million offer for Whittingham from Wimbledon earlier this year, said: \\u2018He's not for sale and that's that.\\u2019 YOU'LL BE ALL WRIGHT Says Millwall chief Gunner told Den is safe HARRY HARRIS MILLWALL chairman Reg Burr last night gave assurances that Ian Wright will be safe at the Den tomorrow night. There are fears of reprisals after Wright was involved in a controversial coin-throwing incident at Highbury in the first leg. Wright was accused of feigning injury, despite his claims he was definitely hit, which was apparently backed up by video evidence. Plea The local police will advise the referee to instruct Wright to avoid any exaggerated goal celebrations that might provoke crowd reaction. And Burr has issued a personal plea to Millwall fans in the match programme. He has asked for them to behave, and stated that any fans caught throwing coins or taunting Arsenal's black players will be banned for life from the ground. Burr said: \\u2018I am sure Ian Wright will be perfectly safe at the Den. He's been here enough times in the past. \\u2018Any behaviour that causes us potential damage will be unacceptable. I can never condone coin-throwing or racial abuse. We don't have it at the Den. If we do we shall stamp it out. \\u2018Ian Wright will be safe\\u2026 I just hope our goal will be safe from him!\\u2019 Millwall are set to sign Sunderland's FA Cup hero John Byrne. Millwall boss Mick McCarthy made an approach for the striker three weeks ago, but was given the cold shoulder. Said Byrne: \\u2018I have no plans to leave Roker. But if a move was on, I would fancy Millwall.\\u2019 HIT MAN ARSENAL'S Ian Wright won't receive any racial abuse at the Den, according to Millwall chairman Reg Burr Hot time for Howey NEWCASTLE'S Steve Howey will face the toughest examination of his new life at the back tomorrow. The 20-year-old, a reserve team striker less than a year ago, is now a key man in Kevin Keegan's all-conquering outfit. But Howey and his defensive colleagues are the players targeted for an all-out assault by derby rivals Middlesbrough in the Coca-Cola Cup showdown at Ayresome Park. Boro midfielder Andy Peake insisted yesterday: \\u2018I don't think anybody has had a real go at Newcastle's back four this season. \\u2018Now they are coming to play a Premier League side on their own ground. It will be their toughest test so far.\\u2019 Boro's in-form strikers Paul Wilkinson and Bernie Slaven will be quick to punish any mistakes by Keegan's men. But Howey insisted last night he was relishing the challenge of a tie balanced on a knife-edge after the goal-less draw at St James's. \\u2018There are times this season when we have been under pressure and coped well,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We know Boro will come at us, but that won't bother me \\u2014 and I'll get plenty of help from the rest of the defence.\\u2019 Howey's career has been transformed since former boss Ossie Ardiles switched him to centre half last season. MAC MAGIC Chesterfield of dreams REDS FACE NEW BOX OF TRICKS JOHN EDWARDS PLUCKY Chesterfield sent a tremor through crisis club Liverpool last night by warning them: \\u2018We've got a few more tricks up our sleeve.\\u2019 The little Third Division side caused a sensation at Anfield a fortnight ago by storming into a 3-0 lead in the first leg of their Coca-Cola Cup tie. Shell-shocked Liverpool recovered to force a 4-4 draw, but the ordeal isn't over yet, says Chesterfield boss Chris McMenemy. He has vowed to put Graeme Souness's side under the cosh again for tonight's return leg at Saltergate. \\u2018If Liverpool are at their best, they will be too good for us,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018But we have been working on a few things, just as we did before the first leg. \\u2018My players didn't freeze at Anfield, and I know they won't be overawed about facing Liverpool again. \\u2018They are really looking forward to it and are determined to put Liverpool under just as much pressure as at Anfield. \\u2018If they manage that, I just hope we can force Liverpool into making as many errors as in the first leg.\\u2019 Chesterfield's front three of Andy Morris, Steve Norris and Dave Lancaster are planning another bombardment of the Liverpool defence. \\u2018Our strength is up front and we will be looking to exploit that,\\u2019 added McMenemy. \\u2018This is going to be more difficult than the first match, but I feel we're ready for it.\\u2019 But Liverpool birthday boy Bruce Grobbelaar, 35 today, is ready to stop the party-poopers. Grobbelaar, who won back the goalkeeper's jersey from David James after the home leg, said: \\u2018We will have to weather the storm. \\u2018That's what you always expect when you go to lower division grounds and this one will be no different. \\u2018If we can keep them contained for the first half then we've got a chance of pinching a couple of goals.\\u2019 Chesterfield, who haven't been past the second round stage for nine years, have lost both their League games since their night of glory at Anfield. INSPYRED CHOICE BOSS Chris McMenemy is hoping his strike-force of Dave Lancaster (left) and Steve Norris (right) can lift the Spyrites to beat Liverpool CLOUD BURST BOTH Steve Cauthen and Pat Eddery rode winners at Saint-Cloud yesterday. Cauthen captured the Group Three Prix Eclipse on the Andre Fabre-trained Elizabeth Bay. Eddery took the Listed Prix Massine on Matador, trained at Marlborough by Roger Charlton. MICHAEL ROBERTS was in form at Pontefract yesterday, rattling off a 959-1 treble to make 190 \\u2014 a lead of 30 over Pat Eddery. Roberts was on target for different stables, scoring aboard Branston Abby (Mark Johnston), Aradanza (Mick Channon), and Good For The Roses (Matt McCormack). A British double-century looks very much on for the 11-times South African champion, who was the first man to achieve that feat in his native land. Roberts said: \\u2018I should get to 200 with a bit of luck, especially as Alec Stewart and Clive Brittain have plenty of ammunition left between them.\\u2019 Talented hurdler Ambuscade finally broke his Flat duck at the 22nd attempt to initiate a 34-1 double for Kevin Darley. TENBY was all the rage yesterday for the Derby down to 8-1. Ladbrokes go 33-1 bar. JACK IS MAGIC CHARLES FAWCUS JACK BERRY went ton up for the second time with two Warwick winners yesterday, just to prove that no one needs a magic carpet to be a hit. Three trainers have now crossed the hundred barrier this season and, of them, only Henry Cecil is backed by oil-rich sheikhs. Jack and Richard Hannon keep on banging in the winners while others are rushing about like headless chickens in the belief that the sky is falling down. It is rubbish to think that, because Sheikh Mohammed and his brothers did not bid for a single horse at Newmarket last week, the racing game is about to die on its feet. There are over 300 horses chasing each other round three Flat meetings today \\u2014 not much death there. The truth is that there is too much racing and too many horses. If the sport was pruned, there would be more prize-money to go round. It's not surprising that the Maktowm brothers are  considering trimming their operation, but they will still have a huge stake here. The family is well aware of the poor level of prize-money in Britain, but their decision not to bid had more to do with a clash of personality with Tattersalls than any pull-out threat. \\u2018The Maktowms have been big spenders at Newmarket, but they have never been made really welcome there,\\u2019 an insider told me. \\u2018Sales companies in America and Ireland go out of their way to make them feel at home. There is little doubt they will be bidding in Ireland to-morrow. \\u2018There was another row at Newmarket last year when Sheikh Mohammed bought In The Groove privately rather than at a Tattersalls  auction .\\u2019 FERGIE IS A JOKE THE TRUTH about United and ME \\u2018He made me an outcast at Old Trafford\\u2019 PAUL McGRATH TED MACAULEY WHEN Alex Ferguson joined Manchester United as the new boss he wanted me out of Old Trafford so badly he tried to make me redundant. And it nearly worked. I was so downhearted and at such a low ebb because he made it painfully clear I didn't figure in that great club's future, however much I loved the place. He was so tough, so unbending and uncompromising, and I don't think he's changed. He made doubly sure I realised I was an outcast in a heavy-handed way \\u2014 and he couldn't get rid of me fast enough. I felt then as if my whole life had collapsed. And he's made it even worse just now by raking ashes that are three years old. Why? What's he trying to do to me? He got rid of me and that should have been the end of it. But in a book he's written he's had a real big pop at me in a sour way. And it's just not on. Concerned Fergie has been saying that he was so concerned about my life-style away from football he called in Sir Matt Busby, the club doctor and even a parish priest to try to get me sorted out. What absolute rubbish \\u2014 he's gone right over the top with a load of old cobblers there and I don't know why. He's making it sound as if I was stretched on a couch, locked in a room with a \\u2018Do not disturb\\u2019 sign on the door while Sir Matt, the doc and a priest I have certainly never met, got to work straightening me out, socially, medically and religiously. What a joke. I'm not the least bit religious so the idea of a priest having any influence on my life is ridiculous. I can't ever recall even meeting a priest when I was at United, though there always seemed to be plenty of them around. As for saying Sir Matt was called in to counsel me \\u2014 well, that's sheer nonsense. I only ever spoke to him socially and not very often at that. The great man just was not in my orbit. So I feel I have every right to defend myself. And I'm sure I would have left the club readily and earlier if I'd known what he was going to say later. Collision He's making me out to be some sort of thick, brainless  loony on a self-destruct road to ruin. And that me and my old pal Norman Whiteside were on a collision course with him, that we needed to be split up. And with him adding that he had to get rid of a notion in football that Manchester United was a drinking club. I don't know Norman's reaction to Fergie's story but I can say they have left me with a bitter feeling. All my dreams of playing for United to the end of my career \\u2014 and I was on a seven- year contract \\u2014 vanished when Ferguson called me into his office and offered me a cash pay-off to clear out and go and do something else with my life. Rise I was staggered. I'd only once asked for a transfer and not because of any discontent or fall- out with the club. I wanted a pay rise because I found out I was way behind most of the first-team lads and barely on much more than the apprentices' wages. It was amazing how little the money was at such a famous and unbelievably well-supported club. And when I found out after a bit of dressing-room chat what the other lads were on I had to make a point. I figured that if I asked for a transfer I'd either get a rise or would be able to work out a better deal for myself if I went elsewhere. In truth, I didn't want to quit United if it could be avoided, I was totally hooked on the place. But things just went from bad to worse. Ferguson refers to a pub and club session that Norman Whiteside and I had, and that come Friday I couldn't train \\u2014 even though, he said, I was supposed to be playing against Queens Park Rangers. He says that after he doesn't know how many reprimands, I refused to play on Saturday protesting that I wasn't fit enough. Fergie's memory has failed him there. He had already told me on the Friday at the training session, and in front of about 20 of the lads, that I wasn't in the team. And that was that. But he changed his mind and only wanted me to play against QPR when Lee Sharpe went down poorly. But I really wasn't fit. Agony One of the bigger problems was that Fergie believed I was taking the mickey out of him by either cheating or going soft and feigning injury. And I was missing too many games complaining of a bad knee when there was nothing really wrong with it. I honestly believe that's what he thought. But I knew differently. I finished some games in absolute agony, but said nothing and kept it to myself. But it worried me. I trained as often and as hard as I could, as hard as anybody on the staff \\u2014 and that includes my old pal Bryan Robson, who was notorious for his unflagging effort \\u2014 but the pain was excruciating. Crazy No professional likes to miss the chance to play \\u2014 that's why, really, we're in the game \\u2014 and I was no exception. But Fergie wanted more from me than I was able to give. What with that and a few crazy reports to him about my off-duty life-style flying about he decided United and me were going nowhere together. He wanted me out. FERGUSON: Tough and unbending ATKINSON: Sorry to see him go SIR MATT: We only spoke socially THE former Manchester United defender, now a vital man in Aston Villa's surge to the title, reveals the torment of his days at Old Trafford. Terry's offer boosted me THE TRUTH about United and ME PAUL McGRATH TED MACAULEY TERRY Venables restored a lot of my confidence by asking me to join Tottenham. I admired Venables, his flamboyant style and attitude, but I could see the dangers in the temptations of life in London and I regretfully turned down the move. It wasn't such a bad idea, even though Spurs are one of the truly great clubs and Venables one of the brightest bosses. I knew it wouldn't be a wise move for me. Redundancy and a wrecked career as a forgotten man seemed inevitable until right out of the blue Graham Taylor threw me a lifeline and persuaded me to join him at Aston Villa. Angry Blades up for sale MATT HUGHES SHEFFIELD United were put up for sale yesterday in a shock move at Bramall Lane. It means chairman Paul Woolhouse may have to quit the club after claims that he has missed a deadline to pay for \\u00a33million worth of shares. A controlling block of the club's shares is going back on the market and a new owner could emerge in the next few weeks. Former managing director Derek Dooley is being invited to return as temporary chairman until new owners take control. But Woolhouse yesterday insisted he was still chairman. The shares held by Else 1982 Ltd, a trust chaired by Len Brealey, brother of former chairman Reg, should have passed to Woolhouse last year. But yesterday the company issued a statement saying the payment schedule had not been met. Said Len Brealey: \\u2018The plain facts are that after Mr Woolhouse failed to reach payment in an original contract we set up a new agreement. \\u2018Again he has not honoured his pledges. A deadline was set up but it has come and gone and we no have no alternative but to reclaim the shares and place them back on the market. \\u2018If my brother Reg wants to buy them he must come up with the money, but there are a number of interested parties, individuals and consortiums who have expressed a desire to take over the club.\\u2019 Reg Brealey said yesterday: \\u2018I am sorry to see the club in this position.\\u2019 But he refused to comment on whether he wished to return to Bramall Lane. TIGER BILL: THE GREATEST AUSSIE cricket legend Bill O'Reilly, rated by Sir Donald Bradman as the best bowler he ever faced, has died aged 86. \\u2018Tiger\\u2019 O'Reilly, who at 6ft 3in bowled medium-paced leg-breaks, played 27 Tests between 1931 and 1946. He took 144 wickets at an average of 22.59, including three hauls of 10 wickets in one match. He formed a devastating partnership in many Tests with leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett. It has been said that \\u2018when O'Reilly appealed it was not a request but a demand for the blood of the victim.\\u2019 Bradman said yesterday: \\u2018I am very sorry indeed to hear of the passing of my old friend and colleague. \\u2018He was the greatest bowler I ever faced or saw, and in my opinion certainly the best bowler Australia ever produced.\\u2019 O'Reilly later became a well respected newspaper columnist. Botica is the spark MARTIN RICHARDS Wigan 48, Oldham 8 WIGAN swept into the final of the Greenalls Lancashire Cup with a merciless hammering of Oldham. Classy stand-off Frano Botica rattled up 20 points with a try and eight goals from ten attempts. Shaun Edwards chipped in with his 18th try of the season but it was the Wigan fans' new hero \\u2014 18-year-old winger Jason \\u2018Billy Whizz\\u2019 Robinson \\u2014 who stole the show with two tries. Full back Joe Lydon also grabbed a couple in an impressive performance. And another of Wigan's promising youngsters \\u2014 second rower Barrie-Jon Mather \\u2014 scored the final try three minutes from time, courtesy of Phil Clarke and substitute Martin Crompton. Oldham gave Wigan more problems than the scoreline suggests and they were well served by prop Tiny Solomona and scrum half Steve Terry. But all they could show for their efforts were two second half tries for Barry McDermott and Richard Russell.

Ron plea DAVID MOORE RON Atkinson has ordered his high-riding Aston Villa team: \\u2018Be ruthless \\u2014 there's no room for mistakes.\\u2019 Villa's sharp shooters, mounting a serious championship bid, switch their sights to the Coca-Cola Cup tonight aiming to gun down Oxford. But boss Atkinson warned: \\u2018We need to be on our guard after giving Oxford the lifeline of a late goal at their place in the opening leg. \\u2018A lead of 2-1 guarantees nothing, except the fact that we need to be on our toes against a side who will relish the big occasion.\\u2019 Big Ron, robbed of ace defender Paul McGrath by hamstring trouble, and England Under-21 winger Steve Froggatt, because of an ankle injury, is hoping for a 20,000-plus crowd this evening.

Edwards could complete his move before tonight's Coca-Cola Cup clash with Notts County. EDWARDS Botica is the spark MARTIN RICHARDS Wigan 48, Oldham 8 WIGAN swept into the final of the Greenalls Lancashire Cup with a merciless hammering of Oldham. Classy stand-off Frano Botica rattled up 20 points with a try and eight goals from ten attempts. Shaun Edwards chipped in with his 18th try of the season but it was the Wigan fans' new hero \\u2014 18-year-old winger Jason \\u2018Billy Whizz\\u2019 Robinson \\u2014 who stole the show with two tries. Full back Joe Lydon also grabbed a couple in an impressive performance. And another of Wigan's promising youngsters \\u2014 second rower BarrieJon Mather \\u2014 scored the final try three minutes from time, courtesy of Phil Clarke and substitute Martin Crompton. Oldham gave Wigan more problems than the scoreline suggests and they were well served by prop Tiny Solomona and scrum half Steve Terry. But all they could show for their efforts were two second half tries for Barry McDermott and Richard Russell. BOTICA: 20 points Eagles fly high Sheff 12, Hull 8 SHEFFIELD Eagles soared to the finals of the Yorkshire Cup for the first time \\u2014 despite Hull's stunning opening when Lee Jackson touched down in less than nine seconds. The Great Britain international hooker charged down full-back Garry Jack's  clumsy attempt to kick up field and then pounced over the line, Paul Eastwood adding the two points. But shell-shocked Sheffield forged into the lead after a Mark Aston penalty goal and a try by Bruce McQuire. In the second half Aston stretched Sheffield's lead with another penalty.

Call for fresh probe into firm Beggs accuses Dail of inaction AN Ulster MP today accused the Dail of deliberately refusing to investigate a firm which lost millions of pounds belonging to Northern Ireland people. Almost 1,000 of the province's investors lost their life savings when Gibraltar-registered company International Investments Ltd went bust in 1984, leaving debts of \\u00a37m. The Gibraltar authorities have provided information to the RUC, who have an arrest warrant out on company head Cork-born George Finbarr Ross, now believed to be living in Dallas, Texas. But politicians north and south of the border are calling for the Republic's Government to start a High Court inquiry into Ross' alleged links with firms in Eire. The Irish Government says the 10-year-old scandal has already been fully investigated by the Garda and, unless new evidence is produced, it is now a matter for the Gibraltar authorities. But, East Antrim MP Roy Beggs, says he believes the Irish Government do not want to investigate because the case could embarrass senior political figures. \\u2018They have no desire to investigate this matter properly because it could prove to have serious ramifications for a number of political parties and senior individuals,\\u2019 he claimed. \\u2018I will not back any political talks with the South until I have evidence of genuine goodwill over the International Investments affair. \\u2018If they had investigated thoroughly at the time they might not only have been able to identify other elements of the fraud but also help secure some of the lost assets.\\u2019 Mr Beggs said a number of Southern politicians support his demands for an inquiry and he hoped the issue would be raised when the Dail resumes again in October. \\u2018Some of the TDs cannot ignore the situation and it is going to become more and more difficult for Enterprise and Employment Minister Ruairi Quinn to avoid appointing a High Court inspector.\\u2019 Democratic Left MEP, Des Geraghty, says he will petition the European Parliament to make the Eire Government act. Mr Beggs said the hearing in Gibraltar which is to re-open in October could result in a move to extradite Ross from the United States if there is sufficient evidence. \\u2018He could stand trial in Gibraltar but I would imagine the RUC would wish to interview him.\\u2019 TYNESIDE New blow for shipyard THE dying Swan Hunter shipyard has been dealt another crushing blow with its failure to win a key \\u00a350m order. Oman is placing an order for three patrol craft with French shipbuilders after weeks of waiting in the hope that a buyer might be found for the Tyneside yard. Swan was the favourite to secure the lucrative contract until the yard was placed in receivership in May. Shopping is the antidote to economic doom and gloom, claims survey Families \\u2018spending way out of slump\\u2019 FAMILIES are ignoring wage-freezes and trying to spend their way out of the slump. Faced with economic doom and gloom, the average householder simply goes to the shops, according to a survey today. The result is a bucking of current trends with the growth in spending outstripping rises in income for the first time in three years. New statistics show average incomes rose from \\u00a3338 to \\u00a3343 a week (1.4pc after inflation) while average spending increased to \\u00a3272 from \\u00a3257 a week (5.8pc or 2.3pc after inflation). Contrast These statistics are in stark contrast to those for the previous year, 1991, when families tightened their belts despite having more in their pay packets. However, the figures also show families are relying less on traditional wage-packets as a source of income and more on social-security benefits. The figures are revealed in Family Spending, an annual survey of more than 7,000 households published by the Central Statistical Office. About 5.5 million public-sector employees have had a 1.5pc ceiling imposed on pay awards by the Government, but it is thought lower interest-rates may have encouraged people to spend. On average, 65pc of a household's income is from wages and salaries, compared with 74pc in 1965, the survey shows. In contrast, investment income has risen to 6pc from 3.5pc, and social-security benefits have risen to 13pc from 8pc. A spending breakdown shows the average household spends \\u00a347.70 on food, \\u00a347.40 on housing and \\u00a342.90 on transport. A further \\u00a313 a week goes on fuel. Nevertheless, families still manage to set aside \\u00a340.90 a week for leisure goods and services. The top 20pc of households receive an income (\\u00a3786) 10 times greater than the poorest 20pc, which lives off \\u00a373 a week, with the richest 20pc spending \\u00a3165.30 a person more than twice as much as the poorest 20pc, who spend \\u00a362.50 per person. The highest earners (\\u00a3800 a week-plus) are spending \\u00a393.20 a week on motoring, 15 times more than the lowest earners (less than \\u00a360), who spend \\u00a36.10 a week. The report shows a typical family of a man, a woman and two children spends an average of \\u00a3372 a week. One in three of these families has two cars. However, only one in nine households is \\u2018typical\\u2019, most consisting of just a man and a woman. One in four households is retired. Nearly two-thirds of households are owner-occupiers. Ulster folk hold on to holiday cash FAMILIES in Northern Ireland spend least on holidays, while men in the south-west of England make their underwear last longer and the Welsh love their cuppa. East Anglians are the greatest pet-lovers, and the Scots spend most on tobacco, according to the survey, which shows: Weekly spending on domestic help is lowest in the north of England at 58p and highest in East Anglia at \\u00a35.20 against the UK average of \\u00a32. Scots spend \\u00a37.40 a week on tobacco, more than 50pc more than the lowest region, the south-east of England, which spends just \\u00a34.50. Men in the south-west of England spend just 27p a week on new underwear, compared with top-spending Londoners and men in the north of England, who spend 49p and 46p respectively. Households in Northern Ireland spent just \\u00a35 a week on hotels and holidays, less than half the UK average of \\u00a311. Pets are pampered in East Anglia, where families splash out \\u00a34.20 on their animals, compared with just \\u00a31.61 in the north of England and a UK average of \\u00a32.10. Households in Wales spend most on tea, at 66p a week, 10p a week more than Scotland and the west Midlands and 7p more than the UK average. 10pc have satellite or cable TV ALMOST one in 10 homes has a satellite dish or cable TV. Both have taken off, with ownership increasing by 50pc between 1991 and 1992. Home computers can also be found in one in five households, compared with just one in eight seven years ago. Video Seven out of 10 homes, including more than one in four households with incomes under \\u00a360 a week, now own a video recorder a 5pc rise on the previous year. Car ownership has slowed, with 67.6pc of people owning a vehicle, compared with 67.8pc in 1991. In 1981, the figure was 61.8pc. More than 88pc of homes have a telephone, up from 75pc in 1982. Almost no houses were without televisions and fridges. The banks and their charges RECENT reports and letters about bank charges make it important to restate the General Consumer Council's views and to put the record straight about my own comments. In its evidence to an official inquiry five years ago, the Council said that the odds were overwhelmingly in favour of the banks rather than the customer. We called for a code of practice to be given the force of law. On Friday, August 13, I was asked by your reporter to respond to criticism of banks by the Consumers' Association. I did not say that people were \\u2018fed up with banks digging into their accounts without notice to extract charges\\u2019 nor did I \\u2018slam\\u2019the banks. I did say that banks and building societies with current account customers were in a special position because they can deduct money directly from our accounts. This is why prior information about charges is so important. I also said that banks were not sufficiently up-front about their charges and made some suggestions for changes, such as displaying a poster in each branch and printing details on statements. The Council hopes the banks will recognise the concerns of their customers and become more open about charges. This will lead to greater customer satisfaction and be to everyone's benefit. MAEVE BELL Director, General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. Lagan sludge A NUMBER of weeks ago Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group raised the issue of the dredging of the River Lagan with those responsible \\u2014 the Laganside Corporation, the DoE Water Service and the contractors. At a frank meeting with the above, at which this community's concerns were forcefully put, it was agreed that work would halt during our community festival and that the area would be cleaned up for the festival. To the contractors credit this was done. However, during the course of a television interview a Laganside spokesman informed the public that there was no cause for concern as the mud and filth being dredged from the Lagan was being carefully loaded into \\u2018sealed lorries\\u2019 which were then washed before being driven away. A number of points arise from this statement about \\u2018sealed lorries\\u2019. Either the Laganside spokesperson understands \\u2018sealed\\u2019 to mean something completely different from the rest of us. Maybe he had never actually seen the operation he was describing. Whatever the reason, I think we need to know, because, by any definition, the lorries being used are certainly not sealed. This will be easily demonstrated by watching one of these lorries trundling down the Ormeau Road and through the centre of town. If the spokesman risks this hazardous operation, he should stand well back from the edge of the pavement or risk being splashed by the mud and water spilling from these \\u2018sealed lorries.\\u2019 Should you happen to be driving in the vicinity of one of these \\u2018sealed lorries\\u2019 extreme caution is advised as a number of motorists have found to their cost, sometimes the spills are more substantial. I would advise the Laganside spokesman to check his facts and stop treating the people of the Lower Ormeau and Belfast like idiots. Meals out eat up 20pc of nation's food bill WHILE home cooking is still the norm, almost a fifth of the money spent on eating is for food bought away from home. Of the average family's \\u00a347.66 food bill, \\u00a39.52 is spent outside. More is still spent on meat than other foods \\u00a38, and of this \\u00a33.55 goes on chicken. Fruit Other items include \\u00a36.96 on fruit and vegetables; \\u00a36.01 on butter, margarine, lard, milk, cheese and eggs; \\u00a35.42 on bread, flour, biscuits and cereals; \\u00a32.57 on tea, coffee and other soft drinks; \\u00a31.73 on fish or fish and chips and 36p on ice-cream. A further \\u00a31.98 is spent on sweets, chocolates, jams, honey and sugar. London The survey also shows families in London and the south-east of England spend more on food than the rest of the country, forking out \\u00a351.55 a week.

Customs to probe VAT fraud claim By JOHN CASSIDY A MAJOR investigation has been launched in Ulster into a team of businessmen allegedly behind a carpet and furniture VAT scam. The Customs probe stems from an on-going RUC inquiry into the businessmen's involvement in alleged cheque fraud. Sunday Life has learned that detectives had received a number of complaints against the businessmen after cheques bounced at banks. Fiddle But as the inquiry deepened, detectives suspected the men were involved in a major VAT fiddle. Security sources revealed that the businessmen deal in cheap furniture and carpets bought from Pakistani wholesalers in England. It is understood the goods are bought in Europe and brought to Northern Ireland in articulated lorries. The businessmen then trade their wares, which also include pictures and antiques, at makeshift auctions set up around the province. Said a security source: \\u2018They claim their company is in liquidation and needs to clear debts owed to the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise. \\u2018We had received a number of complaints about bouncing cheques and made a few inquiries into the businessmen and their activities. Dodging \\u2018We suspected that they were dodging VAT and we have since alerted Customs investigators.\\u2019 It is understood Customs are checking for adverts placed in newspapers by the businessmen to promote their auctions. The security source added: \\u2018Customs are checking to see if these men are in fact registered for VAT.\\u2019 Wheeler is loser in Lloyds crisis Ulster minister's cash crash THE MINISTER charged with looking after Ulster's financial affairs has been a loser in an insurance market crash. Sir John Wheeler, the 53-year-old MP for Westminster North, is one of the \\u2018names\\u2019 facing personal losses of thousand of pounds after the market plunged into the red, it has been revealed. Office In June Sir John was appointed Security Minister with responsibility for law and order, finance and information services after Michael Mates resigned over the Asil Nadir affair. It was his first Government office in his 14-year House of Commons career. Sir John is the fourth minister to have served in Northern Ireland affected by the market crash. The others were former Secretary of State Peter Brooke now Heritage Secretary, former Industry Minister Peter Vigger and former Economy Minister Richard Needham. Prime Minister John Major believed he was the right man for the job as he was a former assistant prison governor at Wandsworth and Brixton jails and was chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. Sunday Life contacted the Northern Ireland Office and asked if Sir John he would comment on his personal financial losses. \\u2018I don't think he would want to discuss his private financial arrangements with a newspaper,\\u2019 a Stormont spokesman said. In May Lloyds announced a salvage operation to protect the \\u2018names\\u2019 who lost money in the crash. Companies were invited to invest in the market it is considering a \\u2018modest\\u2019 contribution to help bail out those affected.

This force can be measured by using the principle of electromagnetic induction: A change in magnetic flux induces a voltage across a closed circuit containing a loop of wire. The magnitude of this induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux with respect to time. For example, when a bar magnet moves past a coil of wire, a voltage is induced. If a large number of turns are wound around a soft iron core, then a powerful electric current will flow when the magnet is moved near the wire.\\nIf we look at Figure 12-3, we see that when a magnet is brought into the vicinity of a wire loop, two things happen: (1) the strength of the magnetic field at any point changes due to the changing flux; and (2) the electrons in the wire experience forces as they move along their paths. Because the electrons cannot stop moving, the total force acts on the electrons at all times. Since these forces act on the electrons, they also act on the atoms of which the electrons are part. Thus, the motion of the electrons causes the atoms to vibrate. These vibrations give rise to an oscillating current in the wire, which generates its own magnetic field. As the magnet moves closer to the wire loop, the induced current increases. When the magnet passes the center of the loop, the induced current reaches its maximum value. This current decreases as the magnet moves away from the wire loop because of the decrease in the magnetic flux.\\nFigure 12-3 Magnetic Flux Changes Induce Current\\nAnother way to explain how this works is that if you place one end of a long, insulated wire in a uniform magnetic field, and attach the other end to an ammeter, you will find that no current flows until the field is changed. Once the field has been changed, however, the current continues to flow even after the field has returned to its original state. This means that the magnetic field must be changing continuously for the current to exist. So what happens when we place a wire in a static magnetic field? Let\\u2019s take a look at this in more detail.\\nThe first thing we need to know about this situation is what constitutes a static magnetic field. According to our definition, \\u201ca static magnetic field exists whenever there is an unchanging magnetic force per unit area.\\u201d Now let\\u2019s ask ourselves another question: What would cause such a force? Well, we already know that changing magnetic fields produce currents, so perhaps changing magnetic fields could be responsible for producing currents! And indeed they are\\u2014whenever there is an unchanging magnetic field present, there will always be an associated current running through some nearby material.\\nIn this case, since we have placed one end of our long insulated wire inside the magnet, it follows logically that the entire length of wire should become charged negatively just like everything else inside the magnet. We call this effect the self-inductance of the wire because once again, it is caused by the fact that changing magnetic fields generate electric currents. But wait\\u2014if every length of wire placed inside a magnet becomes positively charged, doesn\\u2019t this mean that each piece of metal inside the magnet becomes positive too? Yes, but remember that metals don\\u2019t have negative charges, so instead of becoming positive themselves, they simply pull their neighbors toward them via the force known as attraction.\\nNow let us consider what happens when we reverse the direction of the magnetic field inside our experiment. Instead of starting out with a positive charge on each length of wire, we start off with a negative charge on each length. Again, since the only possible way for an electron to leave its atom is by being attracted toward something else, we expect to find that each length of wire becomes negatively charged. However, now that we have reversed the direction of the magnetic field, things get interesting!\\nIf we place one end of our long insulated wire inside the magnet and then remove it from the magnet, it will remain positively charged even though there was never any electric current running through it while it was still inside the magnet! This phenomenon is called self-induction, and it explains why changing magnetic fields produce currents in nearby materials.\",\n          \"I was not prepared to travel 140 miles to and from work each day, nor to live away from home on a long term basis, so I inquired about part time training. I was told that if I could get out of my current job by the end of August, there would be room for me at the school. The next week I quit my job and headed back to Maine for a few days before heading off to Gannett Peak.\\nThe riding season ended with a trip up to Wyoming. There were two main reasons for this trip. First was an opportunity to ride with a friend who had been coming to New England to ride for several years. Secondly, it was an opportunity to return to Gannett Peak where I had worked as a firefighter the summer prior. This year I joined the crew as a packer (a person responsible for hauling food, fuel, water, tools and other supplies into the field).\\nI was scheduled to arrive in Rock Springs, WY on September 28th. My friend arrived early and we drove down to the town of Saratoga, just south of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. We spent the first couple of days camping and exploring the area around Yellowstone National Park. On October 3rd we set out for Gannett Peak Base Camp. Our plan was to hike to the base camp, unload the truck, spend some time acclimatizing, then return to base camp to start working. After our first few hours of hiking, however, the rain started and we decided to stop at the trailhead and wait for better weather. It rained all night, but cleared up the following morning, so we decided to continue on.\\nAs we hiked along, the clouds began to clear and the views became more spectacular. We reached the base camp around noon, and after setting up camp, we started unloading the truck. As soon as the last load was off, the clouds rolled back in and we were under another storm. Over the course of the afternoon, the storms passed through and left us with clear skies again. After finishing our chores, we sat around the fire drinking beers until dark.\\nThe next morning the sun was shining again, but the air temperature was still cold. We got up early and made breakfast, then headed down to the lodge to check email and make phone calls. We ate lunch in the lodge before hiking up the road to look over the newly cleared snow-free trail. By late afternoon, the wind picked up and the temperature dropped, so we retreated to the warmth of the lodge for dinner.\\nThe next morning the wind blew even harder than the previous evening. We put off going outside to start breakfast until the wind calmed down, but by the time we finished eating the sky was cloudy and the wind was picking up again. This was the beginning of what turned into a six day period of rain, sleet and snow. There wasn\\u2019t much we could do during the storm, so we read, watched movies and listened to music. By mid week the storm finally subsided enough for us to go outside. We took the chance to walk up the road a bit and assess the damage done by the heavy winds. The biggest concern was a large tree which fell across the road near the bottom of the pass. To get to the top of the pass, we needed to drive around the fallen tree, and it looked like we might have to use the winch truck to help push the tree aside. At least one other vehicle had also become stuck, but the driver was able to free himself and drive back down to the lodge.\\nBy Thursday evening, the weather had improved enough to allow us to go back to work. We loaded our gear onto the sleds and began making our way toward Gannett Peak. For the first hour or so of the journey, the trail was covered in fresh snow. There was only about 5 inches of snow in places, but it was deep enough that we couldn\\u2019t see any rocks, roots or other obstacles. As the sun disappeared behind the mountains and the temperatures began dropping, the snow turned to ice and we struggled to keep our footing. About halfway to the peak we reached a section of trail where it seemed every rock and root had been covered with ice. One misstep could cause a serious injury, so we carefully navigated the trail. Eventually we reached the cabin where we found that our supervisor had already arrived and was waiting for us.\\nWe quickly set up camp in preparation for the arrival of the rest of the crew later that evening. Once they\",\n          \"The other was from the Vice President in charge of  Overseas' Operations, thanking him for his personal contribution to the expansion of European Component Operations.\\nThe first was a little more formal than the second, but it had the same effect. He read it twice and then tore it into small pieces. He threw them away, but not before he had checked to see if they were really paper or if there was some sort of microfilm hidden inside. There wasn't, just paper. But it still made him feel better that he'd taken this precaution.\\nThen he went back to work on the General's report.\\nIt didn't take long to write the cover letter:\\nI have enclosed my comments on the draft of your report concerning the subject matter you requested. I hope these will prove helpful to you.\\nVery truly yours,  \\nJames W. Hewlitt  \\nPresident, DHI Corporation\\nHe left off the word \\\"Sir\\\"\\u2014the report was addressed to _General_ Donovan, after all\\u2014and typed the letter quickly so he could get right to work on the rest. His comments on the report ran to eight single-spaced pages; that meant the entire report would be about forty pages, including the cover letter. He wondered how many copies of it the General would actually want.\\nThere was no question at all that the General's report should include everything Jim wanted included. The only question was whether the General would want to include _all_ the things Jim wanted. That was why Jim had sent along his own version of the report with his comments. It was like an insurance policy. If the General decided that any part of what Jim suggested was too sensitive, all he had to do was drop Jim's suggestions. Then everyone else would think it was because the suggestion was too sensitive, when it was actually because the General didn't agree with it.\\nBut there was another reason for sending along his own version of the report. He wanted the General to know that whatever the final version of the report said, Jim had been the one who had done the work that led to its creation. It was possible that the General wouldn't care about that, but it was also possible that he would. And if he did, it would make life easier for Jim.\\nHe paused for a moment to consider the ramifications of his having written the report himself. If the report was a success, it might make it more likely that the Board of Directors would look upon him as the head of the company rather than merely one of the executives. It might even help him get more money out of the company, which was always a good thing.\\nHe thought about it again.\\nOn the other hand, if it was a failure...\\n#  **[ONE]**\\n**U.S. Army Special Forces Detachment Headquarters  \\nFort Bragg, North Carolina   \\n0835 16 July 2007**\\n\\\"You want to tell me what the hell is going on?\\\" Colonel Roger A.
