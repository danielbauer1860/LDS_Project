This is because the area has been so heavily damaged by human activity that it would be impossible for any Nature Conservation Order to make a positive difference. It seems that the only thing left to do is to wait until enough natural regeneration occurs to restore the site to some sort of balance with nature.\\nHowever, I was recently looking at another part of the Lower River Nith catchment which does have significant potential as an SPA, and I’m wondering whether we shouldn’t try to get this one included in our inventory too?\n",

In fact, it has been reported as one of the most dangerous pesticides due to its potential to cause cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO), classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic” in 2015 based on an assessment of human studies linking glyphosate exposure with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, since then the WHO has revised their classification of glyphosate based on new scientific evidence indicating that the herbicide does not pose a risk for causing cancer in humans. This change was made after reviewing the findings from two large epidemiological studies that were conducted in California and Sweden, respectively. Both of these studies found no link between glyphosate use and NHL development among agricultural workers exposed to high levels of glyphosate over long periods of time.\\nThe new research by WHO also stated that there is insufficient evidence to support a causative association between glyphosate exposure and any other types of cancer. This updated assessment indicates that while further studies are needed to fully understand the risks associated with glyphosate exposure, there is currently no reason to believe that this herbicide poses a significant risk to human health when used according to label instructions.\\nThese recent findings have led some to question whether or not glyphosate can actually cause cancer in humans. While there is still much debate about the safety of this herbicide, it is clear that more research needs to be done before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to use glyphosate should be based on an individual’s own personal assessment of potential risks and benefits rather than relying solely on scientific data alone. With proper precautions taken and continued monitoring of both human health outcomes and environmental impacts, it may be possible to safely utilize this powerful tool without fear of harmful side effects occurring downstream later down the line.\n",
              "57    The reason behind this concentrated specialist activity is that Hardenberger, Howarth, and the BBC PO are making a record of the Maxwell Davies and Blake Watkins concertos together with Harrison Birtwistle's Endless Parade, which last they performed so well and so memorably at York University last season. This was one of the most exciting performances of the year: a trio of highly contrasted works by three composers whose music can be as uncompromisingly difficult to play as it is rewarding for those who relish its challenges.\\nThese are not works to be approached lightly - the solo parts in all three are immensely taxing (the trumpet part in the Davies concerto is particularly tough), but they are also compositions that repay careful attention. We know from his many other works that Maxwell Davies has a very individual approach to instrumental writing and that he always manages to find ways of creating a compelling narrative within the framework of an extended form. The Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra, Op 105 is no exception. The first movement opens with a mood of melancholy mystery before settling into a more rhythmic pattern. The central slow movement, 'Elegy', seems almost funereal at times, but there is some poignant beauty here too; the finale is a quick-paced scherzo which is given a terrific reading here.\\nThe two other works on the programme make similar demands on performers, but from different perspectives. Blake Watkins's concerto is an extremely complex work, technically demanding, and using a wide range of extended techniques. It was written in 2009, and I have been hoping ever since to hear it live - it sounds like a wonderful piece and a considerable achievement for any composer. The opening movement begins in sustained silence, with a series of glissandi rising out of the silence as the orchestra enters. Thereafter we are faced with a variety of styles, including, according to the liner notes, an episode inspired by 'the spirit of Jazz'; this is followed by a slow movement marked 'Nightmare'. The closing Allegro molto agitato opens with a brief cadenza for solo trumpet over which the orchestra plays an ostinato figure - this is a powerful, dramatic conclusion. The second movement of Harrison Birtwistle's Endless Parade is titled 'Gustavus Adolphus' - the name of the Swedish king who led the Protestants against the Catholics during the Thirty Years War (1618-48). It is a work of great intensity and imagination, and it is played here with tremendous commitment by all concerned.\\nThis is a disc of exceptionally high quality. My only reservation is that I would like to have heard these works with a different conductor. Peter Maxwell Davies is a superb writer for the human voice, but it doesn't seem to me that he is always a convincing advocate for his own music. By contrast, Edward Gardner and James MacMillan both have a strong sense of the larger picture when it comes to contemporary music, and this is how their performances come across. Both of them understand the importance of structure and development in new works, and neither rushes ahead without regard for the detail. In addition, both are superb exponents of the music of Harrison Birtwistle, who has had much good fortune in his choice of conductors. Both are excellent musicians too, and the results speak for themselves.\n",

That's because police forces have made it easier to do so through their online systems and they have set up dedicated fraud units.\\\"\\nIn addition, he explained that the rise in mobile phone thefts could be partly responsible for this spike.\\nMeanwhile, according to a survey carried out by The Local Data Company, there has been a significant decrease in the number of shoppers who admit to stealing products from supermarkets in the last five years.\",\n          \"The arguments deployed against the reformers' case are varied. Some argue that the only way to improve teacher quality is to pay more for teachers (which, in turn, would require higher taxes). Others claim that teachers cannot be judged fairly and objectively. Still others maintain that standardized tests cannot accurately measure student learning.\\nThe fact of the matter is that most Americans believe that our children deserve better than a system where 25 percent of them graduate from high school without basic reading skills, where one out of every four ninth-graders does not even reach fourth-grade reading levels, and where nearly half of all public school students drop out before finishing high school. The results of these policies have been devastating: Our young people are falling behind other nations; our economy has suffered as a result. We need urgently to bring about the changes necessary to put our education system on track to succeed, and we need to do it now.\\nIn his State of the Union address this year, President Obama laid out an ambitious agenda for improving our schools, including a plan to provide $4 billion in competitive grants to states to develop new systems of evaluation and support for their teachers. I applaud the president's leadership on this issue, and I am pleased to join with him today by signing into law the America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010, which includes provisions for reforms in teacher preparation programs and teacher evaluation.\\nThese reforms will build upon the steps already taken by my administration to strengthen our efforts to ensure that every child receives a world-class education. That is why, last month, Secretary Duncan announced a competitive grant program to spur the creation or expansion of \\\"teacher residencies\\\" at institutions of higher education nationwide, helping to prepare new teachers through sustained classroom experience and mentoring. And because we know that it is critical to attract top candidates to the teaching profession, the Department of Education also recently launched the Teaching Ambassador Fellowship Program\\u2014a yearlong fellowship designed to help former principals, superintendents, and leaders of state education agencies share their expertise with the next generation of educators.\\nEnsuring that teachers are held accountable for student performance is essential if we want to raise the bar in our classrooms. This means both holding individual teachers accountable for raising student achievement and ensuring that colleges and universities that train our future teachers hold themselves responsible for producing qualified instructors. My Administration is committed to making sure that both happen.\\nI thank Congress for its work on the America COMPETES Act, and I look forward to working with you in the months ahead to continue our progress toward providing every American child with a first-rate education.\",\n          \"Merely perplexing, at times.\\nPosted on September 23, 2016 September 23, 2016 by The Oceanside AnimalsPosted in CatsTagged art, Cats, drawings, kittens, painting, pastels.\\nThank you!
